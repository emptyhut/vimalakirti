It was extremely influential in East Asia.\nThe sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the appearances of the world are illusionary, and the superiority of the actual practise over mere learning. The upāsaka (lay practitioner) Vimalakīrti addresses both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of śūnyatā and teaches them their failings and how they are overcome. The discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence.\nShodo Roshi taught the Sutra during sesshin (week-long meditation retreats) at Tahoma Zen Monastery each fall and spring from 2009 through 2014. Roshi taught in Japanese and translation was given by Daichi Zenni. The teisho were later transcribed and privately published in a 4 volume series.\n","id":0,"length":169,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/"},{"content":"Starting in September 2009 during the fall sesshin at Tahoma Zen Monastery, Roshi give teisho (formal lectures) on the Vimalakirti Sutra.

But more generally and properly, Shodo is the art of coordinating mind, body, and brush. In Japanese calligraphy, Chinese characters which comprise the written language of Japan are brushed with black ink on paper or silk, usually in the form of scrolls. Fluid lines create these letters through a series of dragging, pressing and sweeping actions of the brush. Once begun, each calligraphy is produced in a single moment. There is no opportunity for outlining, filling in, repairing, or augmenting ill-formed lines or characters; for one sheet of paper there is only one chance to produce a finished calligraphy. Therefore, the work must be entered with a settled mind and executed with unfaltering confidence.\nTraining in the art of calligraphy involves practice in ink preparation, brush stroke technique, the shape and construction of letters, and placement and spacing of the characters on the sheet. Yet technical facility is not the primary measure of great calligraphic art. The work of calligraphy masters is suffused with spirit, ki, the direct expression of mind and energy. This quality is perceptible in the strength and fluidity of the lines and characters produced. It is also visible at a microscopic level in the alignment of the ink particles (bokhi) in the brushed lines.\n       Expand Jikishin kore jodo - 直心是浄土  Calligraphy and Zen The calligraphic line is a lasting trace of the mind that produced it. The quality of the line reflects the mind of the calligrapher in the moment of executing the brush stroke. It cannot be otherwise, Harada Roshi says.\nThe calligrapher becomes one with the brush in the moment of executing each line.\nOmori Sogen, a 20th centery Zen master, puts it like this: “For a line to be properly composed, the mind must be composed.” The emphasis is on focusing all of one’s attention on the act of writing. Zen calligrapher Terayama Katsujo comments, “What matters above all is the utilization of the entire body and mind in the ‘here’ and ‘now’. The problem is not ‘How to write beautifully’, but rather ‘How to be awakened through writing.’” Realizing what is in the here and now as distinct from what has been in the past or will be in the future, what might be expected, feared, or hoped for: that is the task. The present moment contains all that is, even as it is fleeting and incapable of being held onto. The trace, left by the ink on the brush in the moment of creation, is an impression of the mind that produced it in that instant.\nProfessional calligrapher Gochiku puts it this way: “Technical skill comes from training with a brush, while the heart of a work comes from training the mind.” Since alignment of mind is the province of Zen meditation, the link between Shodo and Zen is strong. In fact, there is a specific term, Zenga, to denote Zen Buddhist calligraphy and brush painting. In zenga, the strict aesthetic rules that govern non-Buddhist calligraphy are disregarded. The message, expressing the state of mind of liberation, is what is of primary importance. Often, letters and images are combined in the same piece.\nAll of the zen arts and zen meditation are intended to focus attention on the present moment. Through the practice and mastery of zen meditation, the mind is emptied of extraneous thoughts and preoccupations; constraints of attachment are shed. When we are not pulled around by our thoughts and emotions or stuck on our attachments, our perspective broadens beyond our personal concerns, and our responsiveness increases. The expression on paper becomes unhesitating and spontaneous.\nHarada Roshi emphasizes that “the essential way of being and the true way of seeing” enable free-flowing and harmonious expression in all the arts, including calligraphy, tea ceremony, ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement), kudo (archery), or kendo (swordsmanship). This immediate and direct expression can only be achieved when ego filters and ideas of a self are cast aside and we become one with the whole universe.\nThus, the practices of Zen meditation and Japanese calligraphy complement each other. Many Zen masters have become accomplished calligraphers. Some, like Omori Sogen, use Shodo as a form of Zen practice; some employ the calligraphies as a teaching device and a link to Zen history and wisdom.\nHakuin Zenji, an eighteenth century Rinzai Zen master of profound depth and energy, is perhaps the most famous Zen calligrapher and exemplar of zenga. He left a huge number of calligraphies, many of which combined letters and images in the same work, even using stylized letters or characters to denote representational images. Harada Roshi notes that in Hakuin’s case, calligraphy is truly an extension of his single-minded vow to liberate all sentient beings. He wanted to pass this message on and used his letters to touch as many people as he could.\nCalligraphy, content and context Phrases on calligraphy scrolls most often represent familiar sayings, poems, or koans from Zen wisdom or Japanese literature. Frequently the sayings reflect images of nature in the seasons and their metaphoric relationship to states of mind. Other frequent images on scrolls include nature landscapes and common Zen symbols such as ensos (circles), staffs, and images of Bodhidharma, the founding patriarch of Zen.\nKoans are puzzling questions or paradoxical problems taken from comments or conversations of the ancient Zen masters, which have been cataloged and kept alive over the centuries. In the Rinzai tradition, Zen students are asked to meditate on a koan from morning to night, night until morning, until they become one with it. The “solution” is not an intellectual understanding of the problem but a direct experience of its truth. Writing the koans calligraphically is sometimes done as a meditation: a way of focusing body, mind, and spirit on the words, images and feelings of the koan. When the student approaches the paper with ‘no-mind’ (mu-shin) and becomes one with the brush and the characters and the koan, the “answer” to the koan may be revealed; simultaneously, a powerful calligraphy is produced. The qualities of fluidity, firmness, and vigor are seen in the lines, and the qualities of spaciousness and balance are evident in and between the characters on the sheet. There is a merging of self and koan. It is the manifestation of oneness that is at the heart of Zen.\nJust as koan study is a meditation tool, another is being in the presence of nature and all that surrounds us. Sayings and poems that focus on observations of nature and truth in nature direct the attention of calligrapher and audience alike to the natural world and the present moment within it. Further, these calligraphies pay homage to the wisdom of the ancient poets even as they become the object for being in the here-and-now with ink and brush and paper. A frequent image of Zen calligraphers, including Harada Roshi, is the enso, a circle that visually reveals both totality and void, wholeness and emptiness. Rather than being opposites, these characteristics merge into something singular and indissoluble: seeming dualities merge into Oneness, the basic tenet of Zen, in this single linear form. And like Zen practice, the process of producing that simple line to create a fluid, vigorous, and harmonious image is not easy. Scrolls are traditionally mounted on silk and hung in temples, tea rooms, and individuals’ homes, often in tokonomas (alcove). At times in Japanese history, statues and images of Buddha were outlawed in an attempt to discourage the practice of Zen. Calligraphy scrolls hung in tokonomas came to represent the Buddha, and this practice continues today.\nUnlike much of western art, fixed in frames and permanently hung, a Japanese calligraphy is frequently displayed for a particular occasion or for a season and then replaced or rotated with other scrolls. This aspect of Japanese calligraphy is consistent with other zen arts including flower arrangement and tea ceremony with the emphasis on freshness and attention to the constantly changing natural world.\nCalligraphy has always played a role in Japanese tea ceremony. This ceremony is a formalized practice of serving and receiving matcha, whisked Japanese green tea, in an intimate setting. Typically, the ceremony is conducted in a small and spare room, measured to accommodate four and one-half tatami mats, bare except for tea making implements and a large niche or tokonoma. In the tokonoma is a single flower and a scroll, each appropriate to the current event or season. Everything in the small space is designed to direct the participants’ attention to the present moment: the warm, fragrant tea presented in a handmade bowl with its particular visual and tactile characteristics; the sweet and bitter tastes of the confection and the tea itself; the movements, sounds and gestures of the host and guests and the interaction between and among them.\nEarlier it was mentioned that each calligraphy is rendered in a single moment\u0026ndash;a moment in which the calligrapher becomes one with the brush. It is this immediacy that the calligraphy at its best can translate to the viewer: an opportunity to be in the moment and at one with the image as you experience it. This book of Shodo Harada Roshi’s work is offered in that spirit. Read it continuously, or open it randomly when it calls to you. Either way, the hope is that you will encounter the feeling and energy that is central to Shodo Harada Roshi’s mastery of shodo. His calligraphies, along with his wise commentaries on the subjects depicted, reflect the spirit and delight at the heart of his approach to zen; and they are an invitation to explore life lived unencumbered by presumption and expectation\u0026ndash;lived in the living.

The Buddha would teach in very simple, direct phrases that would touch each person in a different way. For example, upon hearing “All is empty,” a greedy person becomes terribly melancholy, thinking how sad it is that all these things he wants are after all empty. Those who are unlucky in whatever they do, for whom nothing comes out right no matter how they try it, might think, “Well that’s all right! If all is empty after all, it must be so hard for everyone! There’s no need to be so upset about it!” The very ambitious would hear “All is empty” and know that even if they have great prosperity and have gathered great wealth they will eventually die and see that none of it has any meaning. It gives them a chill. They see that they must help others and do something differently. Each person hears this one simple sentence directly put by the Buddha and feels it in a very different way.

He had already made offerings to immeasurable buddhas, deeply planting the foundation of goodness. He had attained forbearance of the nonarising [of dharmas], and his eloquence was unhindered. He disported in the numinous penetrations and had achieved all the dhāraṇīs. He had attained fearlessness and had subjugated the troubling vengeance of the Māras. Entering into [all the] gates of profound Dharma, he was excellent at the perfection of wisdom. Having penetrated skillful means, his great vows had been accomplished.\nUnderstanding the tendencies of the minds of sentient beings, he was also able to discriminate between those of sharp and dull faculties. Long [a practitioner of] the path of buddhahood, his mind was already pure, and he was deﬁnitively [dedicated to] the Mahayana. He considered well the activities of the realms of existence, and, residing in the deportment of the Buddha, his mind was great as the ocean. The buddhas praised him [as their] disciple, and the Indras, Brahmās, and world lords (i.e., heavenly kings) revered him.\nWanting to save people, [Vimalakīrti] used his excellent skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī, where with wealth immeasurable he attracted the poor, with the purity of his morality he attracted the miscreants, with the moderation of his forbearance he attracted the angry, with great exertion he attracted the indolent, with singleminded concentration he attracted the perturbed, and with deﬁnitive wisdom he attracted the foolish.\nAlthough he was a white-robed [layman], he maintained the pure Vinaya conduct of a śramaṇa; although he resided in the home, he was not attached to the triple world. He manifested the existence of wife and sons, but always cultivated chastity. He revealed the existence of subordinates, but always enjoyed transcendence. Although his clothing was richly decorated, it was with the marks and features [of a Tathāgata] that he adorned his body. Although he drank and ate, the joy of concentration was his [favorite] ﬂavor. If he went to gambling houses or theaters it was only to save people. He hosted those of the heretic paths without breaking his correct faith. Although he illuminated the profane classics he always took pleasure in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all as the one most worthy of offerings.\nTeisho When we only do what we think benefits or profits us, we seldom use our huge potential or access our deep character. That which we don’t like, we don’t feel like doing. If we become too full of delusions, we can clear those away by doing the deep breathing of susokkan. Instead of becoming so irritable and so aggravated, we do our breathing, extending each exhalation. We expand widely—and we are able to reach a place where we become quiet. Realizing how this works, we do it some more, and clarify further, knowing a greater breath and a greater depth of Mind.\nWe are always wanting to control others; this is an expression of one kind of fear. We have to liberate ourselves from this fear. If we align our state of mind, that fear naturally goes away and new wisdom can then come forth. We have all kinds of fantasies and ideas that obstruct us—to let go of all of those is what Vimalakirti knew how to do.\nHe had a deep wisdom that was free from any small-self filter. He could see the best way to be. After we align our awareness—we do susokkan deeply and go to where there is nothing left to be caught on, for everything is all wide open—we become this openness and then we can receive everything. We know from deep within the four Bodhisattva Vows that sentient beings are numberless, and yet no matter how impossibly difficult it is to liberate so many, we vow we will do that impossible thing.\nReferences [4][chapter 2]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

He knew that excellent creations are not all there is to life. Beyond delusion there is deep Mind, which unites all of us through every era. He saw this clearly and knew that this world is the source of the whole great universe. We have to see this and return to this place, and for doing this we have zazen.\nIn order to see this—that there is nothing in existence that is of a fixed, permanent form and that all things are phenomena—we have to first recognize that everything around us is always changing and then realize deeply and clearly what does not change. We do zazen in order to do that. We put aside the things that are moving so quickly in society, and we are able to better realize that place which is slightly different, which isn’t always only involved in that ongoing change.\nWith Vimalakirti’s teaching, we see how to go about helping humans realize that pure mind.

Why? I remember once in the past, when I was begging in a poor neighborhood, Vimalakīrti came and said to me, “‘Kāśyapa, while abiding in the Dharma of universal sameness, you should proceed in sequence in your begging.\n“‘It is because of not eating that you should practice begging.\n“‘It is because of the destruction of one’s physical integrity that you should take that lump of food. It is because of not receiving that you should receive that food.\n“‘You should enter a village with the idea that it is an empty aggregation\n“‘The forms you see are equivalent to [what] the blind [see]; the sounds you hear are equivalent to echoes; the fragrances you smell are equivalent to the wind; the ﬂavors you eat should not be discriminated; your tactile sensations are like the realizations of wisdom; and you should understand that the dharmas are like phantasms. That which is without self-nature and without other-nature originally was not burning and will not become extinguished now.\n“‘Kāśyapa, if you are able to enter the eight emancipations without renouncing the eight perversions, using the characteristic of perversion to enter into the correct Dharma, and using a single meal to give to all, making offerings to the buddhas and the assembly of worthies and sages—only then should you eat.\n“‘To eat in this fashion is neither to have the afﬂictions nor to transcend the afﬂictions, it is neither to enter into concentration nor to arise from concentration, it is neither to abide in the world nor to abide in nirvana.\n“‘Where there is charity, there are neither great nor small blessings, neither beneﬁt nor harm. This is the correct entry into the path of buddhahood, without relying on the śrāvaka[vehicle].\n“‘Kāśyapa, if you can eat according to this [understanding] then you will not render void the charity of those who feed you.’  Teisho In the dojo, before we eat we chant sutras, recognizing that we receive our food from people in society in order to realize our training in its deepest way. We cannot be greedy—this is the teaching of our practice. As our practice continues, we have to make ongoing creative and inventive efforts to live according to our path—not living acccording to our desires but offering everything that we are and that we have to this path. Even if sometimes we are without the things we would prefer to eat, we will not go hungry. With our wisdom and with others’ kindness and offerings, we will be taken care of and receive blessings. If we are practicing our Path correctly, the necessary support will come to us without fail.\nBefore we eat our meals, we always make a saba offering. We do this remembering those who have no food that day, and also for those beings of no form who are nonetheless hungry in Mind. Only after making this offering do we ourselves eat. This is how we eat our meals in the dojo. Of course, we eat because we are hungry, and we are not trying to lose all desires for food. This is not about making our lives more difficult and then calling that practice. Rather, it is about eating humbly and not being greedy in satisfying our desires. Entering samadhi and forgetting society is not the point, nor is the point to enter society and forget our quiet within. The point is not to be drowned in society’s conditions, nor to drown in quietude and forget society’s needs. While not living in the midst of society, neither have we thrown away society. Every day we live in this way. This is the way of the Mahayana, the Path of the Mahayana, and this is the path to realize our true and original Mind. When we awaken to this we will naturally live in this way.\nReferences [6][chapter 3]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Why?\n“I remember once in the past, there were two bhikṣus who had violated the practice of the Vinaya but from their shame did not dare ask you about it. They came to ask me: ‘O Upāli, we have violated the Vinaya and are sincerely ashamed, not daring to ask the Buddha about it. We want you to explain our doubts and the [need for] repentance, so that we may be relieved of the transgressions.’ I immediately explained [the matter] to them according to the Dharma.\n  “At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me, “‘O Upāli, do not increase these two bhikṣus’ transgressions. You should just remove [the transgressions] and not disturb their minds. Why?\n“‘The nature of those transgressions does not reside within, it does not reside without, and it does not reside in the middle.\n“‘As the Buddha has explained, when their minds reside without, and it does not reside in the middle.\n“‘As the Buddha has explained, when their minds are deﬁled, sentient beings are deﬁled. When their minds are puriﬁed, sentient beings are puriﬁed. The mind likewise does not reside within, does not reside without, and does not reside in the middle. Just so is the mind, and just so are transgression and deﬁlement. The dharmas are also likewise, in not transcending suchness.\n“‘Just so, Upāli, when one attains emancipation using the characteristics of the mind, is it (i.e., the mind) deﬁled or not?’ I said, ‘It is not.’\n“Vimalakīrti said, ‘The characteristics of the minds of all sentient beings are likewise, in being without deﬁlement.\n  “‘O Upāli, to have false concepts is deﬁlement; to be without false concepts is purity.\n“‘Confusion is deﬁlement, and the absence of confusion is purity. “‘To grasp the self is deﬁlement, and not to grasp the self is purity.\n“‘Upāli, all the dharmas are generated and extinguished, without abiding. Like phantasms or lightning bolts, the dharmas do not depend on each other. They do not abide even for a single instant. The dharmas are all false views, like a dream, like a mirage, like the moon [reﬂected] in water, like an image in a mirror—[all] generated from false conceptualization. Those who understand this are called “upholders of the Vinaya.” Those who understand this are said to “understand well.”’\n  Teisho Upali had been teaching two monks the practice of repenting, when along came Vimalakirti, saying that what Upali was teaching them was going to make things worse and lead to even more mistakes. Unless the monks saw the true source of their mistaken behavior, it was all useless. And then Vimalakirti taught Upali of the true repentance.\nOn top of having made a mistake, to bring forth the idea that there is an “I” who made the mistake is adding on yet another mistake. You have to teach people to recognize the source of their mistakes, or they will make an even bigger mistake; they will never truly apprehend their mind’s true base. In today’s world, where we generally punish mistakes, this is very hard to grasp. Vimalakirti is saying that what we need to do is not punish but educate.\nExamining and reviewing our past behavior is essential to all religions. We are all constantly making mistakes and behaving unskillfully. So we declare our commitment to change our behavior in front of the Buddha. There is a particular repentance verse for this, and there is a way of chanting the names of all of the three thousand Buddhas, prostrating at each name, for a total of three thousand prostrations. It takes about one week to complete this ceremony. We chant the Buddha’s name while we put our forehead to the floor, bend our back, and actualize that repentance. In doing this, we declare and own our mistakes. This is what is called the repentance of form.\nBut even though we actively repent with the body, the mind is the source of our mistaken behavior, and so we have to also repent our mind’s way of having expressed itself. The best way of doing this is zazen. If you want to truly review and change your behavior, then sit with a straight back, and sit free of any bit of obstruction in your clear mind. You then will realize how all mistaken behavior comes from a murky, occluded state of mind. This is like the clouds in the dark, dark sky. When the morning sun shines through those clouds, all the darkness is dispelled and everything becomes radiant. It is the same in our mind. When the true light of clarity comes, all the clouds and murkiness are dispelled. Zazen is not just about doing koans or sitting, but about clarifying our truest state of mind. This is about being in that clarified state of mind, from morning until night and night until morning in all the positions of sitting, standing, lying down, getting up, walking—all day long, we continue. This is what it is to live. This is zazen.\nReferences [7, 8, 9] [chapter 3]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Why? I remember once in the past when I was explaining the practice of the stage of irreversibility for the heavenly king of the Tuṣita Heaven and his subordinates. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,\n“‘Maitreya, the World-honored One has bestowed on your noble person the prediction that you will achieve anuttarā samyak saṃbodhiin a single lifetime. What lifetime will you use to experience this prediction, past, future, or present? If a past life, then the past life is already extinguished. If a future life, then the future life has not arrived. If the present life, then the present life is nonabiding. It is as the Buddha has explained, “O bhikṣus, you are in this immediate present born, aged, and extinguished.”\n“‘If you experience this prediction with birthlessness, then the birthless is the primary status [of Hinayanist enlightenment]. Yet within that primary status there is no receiving the prediction, and also no attainment of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.\n“‘How, Maitreya, did you receive the prediction of [buddhahood in] a single lifetime? Did you receive the prediction from the generation of suchness, or did you receive the prediction from the extinction of suchness? “‘If you received the prediction by the generation of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without generation. If you received the prediction by the extinction of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without extinction.\n“‘All sentient beings are entirely suchlike, and all dharmas are also entirely suchlike. The assembly of sages and wise ones are also suchlike. Even you, Maitreya, are suchlike. If you received the prediction [of future buddhahood], all sentient beings should also receive it. Why? Suchness is nondual and nondifferentiated. If Maitreya attains anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, then all sentient beings should also all attain it. Why? All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi.\nIf Maitreya attains extinction, then all sentient beings should also all [attain] extinction. Why? The buddhas understand that all sentient beings are ultimately extinguished, which is the characteristic of nirvana, and cannot again be extinguished.\n“‘Therefore, Maitreya, do not inspire the gods with this teaching.\nTeisho Here we have this teaching of Vimalakirti on nonabiding. We think that awakening can be left for the future, but that is not possible. Awakening is only possible in this present moment. It makes no sense to claim that we will be able to experience awakening in a moment of the past or in a moment of the future. We can only be sharp and awake and ready in this very present moment. However, if that past is clarified and we are not caught on a hope of awakening in the future, then we are more likely to be able to sharpen in this present moment. If it is something we hold in our imagination or feel in a vague way like a memory, we are only imagining the superficial thing.\nYou must not cease in your constant, focused application. Even a small bit of water falling one drop at a time, such as water dripping from the eaves onto a stone below, wears away the stone drop by drop. Each time you look away from the present and say to yourself, “Oh I wish it were like this” or “Oh why can’t it be just like that,” the essence will get diluted until you’ve let go of it completely. It is just like making a spark with two sticks. We rub the sticks together and keep rubbing without stopping to get the heat that can then bring forth a spark. Then finally, with the friction of the sticks rubbing against each other there will be smoke, and the spark will come forth and start the paper scraps burning, and a fire can be built. If you are always stopping and resting as you do it, no matter how great a deep vow you have, the goal will not be realized. To do it without ceasing and to keep the efforts going all the way to completion is what is called making true efforts\nReferences [10][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”  Teisho Vimalakirti tells Maitreya that we are all undivided and without dualism in our mind from the origin, so we do not need to make efforts to become that way. In the beginning, all people are clear. But if we have added things on, believing we are of this quality and have that characteristic, we need to let go of those deluded ideas. To do that we have to make great efforts, not to become that clear mind but to let go of what we have constructed and added on to the clear mind that is already there.\nThus Vimalakirti tells us: Do not add on any ideas about what it is to awaken. Do not hold on to anything called an awakening. Do not be attached to anything whatsoever. Do not add second associations and third associations to direct perceptions. Do not hold on to any idea about how hard you are working. That is all extra. Just sit without being caught on an idea of sitting, an idea of doing the practice, an idea of doing anything. Those ideas are what make it so difficult. Don’t give in to making extra associations to whatever you perceive. Just as water flows freely, moving past huge boulders or the roots of tree trunks, when we are free from being caught on anything at all, everything we see, hear, and feel is then the truth, because we are not caught on our ideas about things that we are perceiving and experiencing or by our second associations to those ideas.

A dojo is usually understood as a place of practice, a place where monks train. Sogenji, for example, is considered a dojo. However, Vimalakirti, teaching of the Mahayana, is not talking about a dojo as a location or a place where monks with shaved heads live in a cloistered area. Rather, he is telling us to not give rise to any unnecessary thoughts, even while in the very midst of life—a family life, a life in the world. This is the truer meaning of a dojo, a place where we never leave the truth and we never separate from the practice.\nA dojo is not a location or a place, but a state of mind where we do not let go of our practice, where we are not entertaining extraneous thinking. From morning until night, night until morning, our state of mind cannot be stopped or caught, but must be without gaps and without pauses. This is because in our everyday life and work, that living, flowing state of mind enables us to see how best to do things: to make decisions and act in a natural way that results in the best work. Unless we carefully stay in this fresh, ongoing flow, we get caught. We get out of bed, we do chanting, we do zazen, we do sanzen, we clean, we eat, without stopping in between. We continue without a break, and as we get used to it we see this is the best way to live and to work. When we are taking a rest, we rest completely. When we are working, we work totally and completely. The deep profound mind is the dojo.\nThe dojo is that very determination to put others’ liberation ahead of our own. Working for others without ceasing, we are simultaneously polishing our own deepest wisdom and state of mind. We vow to offer our lives to everyone, while continuing to polish and deepen our own understanding. This is the deep vow of the bodhisattva. The dojo is the honest mind. The dojo is the purified mind. The dojo is the mind of offering all for the liberation of other beings, even ahead of our own deep liberation. All of these being realized is the dojo. Deepen to the place where you are practicing continuously, without any sense of even practicing. This state of mind in which being empathetic and compassionate with all living beings is your prime concern— this is the way of the bodhisattva, and this state of mind is the dojo.\n References [12][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Unless we carefully stay in this fresh, ongoing flow, we get caught. We get out of bed, we do chanting, we do zazen, we do sanzen, we clean, we eat, without stopping in between. We continue without a break, and as we get used to it we see this is the best way to live and to work. When we are taking a rest, we rest completely. When we are working, we work totally and completely. The deep profound mind is the dojo.\nThe dojo is that very determination to put others’ liberation ahead of our own. Working for others without ceasing, we are simultaneously polishing our own deepest wisdom and state of mind. We vow to offer our lives to everyone, while continuing to polish and deepen our own understanding. This is the deep vow of the bodhisattva. The dojo is the honest mind. The dojo is the purified mind. The dojo is the mind of offering all for the liberation of other beings, even ahead of our own deep liberation. All of these being realized is the dojo. Deepen to the place where you are practicing continuously, without any sense of even practicing. This state of mind in which being empathetic and compassionate with all living beings is your prime concern— this is the way of the bodhisattva, and this state of mind is the dojo.\nReferences [12, 13][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

These are the bodhisattva’s joy in the Dharma.\nTeisho In this section, Vimalakirti teaches about dharma joy. The usual pleasures of the world arise from something external, such as listening to music. But dharma joy comes forth from within. Dancing from our utmost inner joy, when we cannot help but dance, is not the same thing as dancing to the sound of an external musical instrument. The same is true with the singing that wells up from deep inside us out of our great joy.\nWe all have this deeper joy, but because we are always looking externally, we don’t realize this state of mind. As Dogen has said, if we are simple and natural in mind, we perceive with our senses, and this joy is a matter of course. We have the sun that rises in the east and the moon that sets in the west. We have the cocks that crow at dawn, and every four years we have a leap year. The joy of these proceeding in their natural order is the dharma joy. The inner joy of the sangha is knowing that the deep True mind is present in all people. There is no one who is not endowed from the origin with this clear mind. There is no difference in the depth of mind of any person, and we live in the joy of knowing that truth.\nReferences [14][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

The inexhaustible lamp is like a lamp that ignites a hundred thousand lamps, illuminating all darkness with an illumination that is never exhausted. Thus, sisters, if a single bodhisattva guides a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi,that bodhisattva’s intention to achieve enlightenment will also never be extinguished.\n“‘With each teaching of the Dharma all the good dharmas are naturally increased. This is what is called the “inexhaustible lamp.” Although you reside in Māra’s palace, with this inexhaustible lamp you can cause innumerable gods and goddesses to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Thereby you will repay the Buddha’s kindness and also greatly beneﬁt all sentient beings.’  Teisho Once we have realized this truth, how can we can live in the world of so many external pleasures and still keep this greater truth alive? How can we keep it in mind? If we return to a world of desire and pleasure, we might forget what we have learned. In response to this question, Vimalakirti, gave the teaching of the inexhaustible lamp. Just as the flame of one lamp can touch and light hundreds and then thousands of other lamps, so our awakening to the truth brings the same awakening to many others’ minds as well.\nBecause others don’t yet know the truth, we must share this light so that a hundred to a thousand to ten thousand will also be able to realize it as well. For the bodhisattva’s light of truth to shine brightly, we have to continually make all possible efforts. We have to bring this truth to all people, and then you will not fall again into superficial reliance on external pleasures. He tells them to hold this teaching precious and share what they have learned with all others.\nReferences [15][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means. “Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”\nThereupon the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indras, Brahmās, and the four heavenly kings in the assembly all thought, “Now these two great bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī and Vimalakīrti will have a discussion. They will certainly explain a wondrous Dharma.”\nAt the time eight thousand bodhisattvas, ﬁve hundred śrā vakas, and a hundred thousand gods all wanted to follow along. Mañjuśrī and the congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples, with the gods reverentially surrounding them, then entered the great city of Vaiśālī.\nAt that time the Elder Vimalakīrti thought, “Now Mañjuśrī and a great congregation is coming.” Then with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.  Teisho When we enter the tea room, we see only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose, and we taste the delicious tea. With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, pruity, and tranquility are realized.\nThe room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure, and so were his heart and his mind; with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha, he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.\nVimalakirti is the one who gave birth to the tea room garden, a small garden outside the tea room that is like the one written about in the Vimalakirti Sutra. Vimalakirti’s room is called a hojo. It is the size of four and one half tatami mats, just big enough for a human to live in the least possible space. Vimalakirti was sick in such a room when Manjusri came to visit with many Bodhisattvas, but there was nothing at all in the room. Vimalakirti was just burning incense and waiting. In the tea ceremony as well, nothing extra is added. There is only the fragrance of incense and flowers; everything else is empty. Thus is the empty mind of the tea master expressed. The guests purify themselves by washing their hands at the rock basin and then enter with a purified mind.\nAt the doorway to the tea ceremony room a fan is placed on the tatami, marking a definite entrance. Then we go to the tokonoma, the place where even in a regular house we find a space for our mind to become settled. Our house is a place to rest our tired body, but it also has to be a place to find peace and a settled mind. The One Drop Zendos are also places where we can respect each other and find peace. The tokonoma was originally a Buddha altar, and that is why incense is offered to the Buddha’s words that hang there, and light is provided to light those words and our travel. To the right is a candle, to the left is water, and in the middle is an incense burner.\nHung in the middle of the tokonoma are the Buddha’s or Patriarchs’ phrases. They always hang there, providing a place of refuge for our mind. The words are a resting place, a staff for our mind, so we can sit down silently. In the tea room the tokonoma is for bowing to and honoring, not as a matter of form but from the true depths of our mind. If we always do that with respect for all people who share this same deep mind, we will all be awakened to that. Then we look at each tea utensil very seriously, examining it and seeing the value in each one. The beauty and the flavor of each has to be looked at carefully to see its highest quality. We can’t just look vaguely; there is no exchange of mind in that.\nA scholar of justice once said to his students, “Do you know that justice and law are the most feared subjects? But they are only about respecting society and the people in it, not about studying punishment. You have to see all things clearly before you start this study. Go and see things that were used as tools before the time of Christ, look at things in the museums and how they were used. You have to learn how to see things deeply. If you can’t pray for the best for society, you can’t understand justice. We have to study all things and see them well to know what will be useful and best for each person.”\nWe look carefully at each individual tea bowl. We touch the life energy of one flower in a vase. We smell the incense and feel the warmth of the water, and there our very mind’s depth is warmed as well. Not as things but as real live people we greet these utensils, and our deep respect grows and is cultivated. As we give our mind to each and every thing, we know the source of peace and harmony. It is not only about respecting people and character, but so often we can’t even do that. We are always judging the ways of others or their past deeds or their bad habits. We are always looking at their weaknesses. But if we do that we can’t truthfully respect them. As Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva did, we have to let go of all ideas of good and bad before we can truly respect someone, and we can’t enter the tea room sincerely unless we are peaceful in our own mind. We must have a mind like a mirror that simply reflects and does not judge. Then we can see in the same way as God, who gives rain equally to good people and bad, and realize that we have that very same mind inside us.\nWhen we let go of everything we have accumulated, we can see directly what is actually there. Then we can use our experiences and knowledge without mistake, for all beings and for all of society. For this we have to purify that mind, this clear “Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.”\nAs the Buddha said, we have to extinguish the flames of greed, extinguish the flames of ignorance, and extinguish the flames of anger, and then we will know nirvana’s tranquillity. If we realize the true source of our mind, we know this pure and clear place, and from there we respect all beings. This is the source of peace for the whole world.\n“Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.”\nNot just for tea ceremony, but as the source of peace for all humankind.\nReferences Bibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

You have come with the characteristic of not coming; you see with the characteristic of not seeing.”\nMañjuśrī said, “So it is, retired scholar. If one has come, there is no more coming. If one has gone, there is no more going. Why? To come is to come from nowhere; to go is to proceed nowhere. That which can be seen is then invisible. “But enough of this matter. Retired scholar, can this illness be forborn? In its treatment is it diminished, so as not to increase? The World-honored One has made immeasurable courteous inquiries about you. “Retired scholar, what is the cause from which this illness arises? Has it been affecting you long? How will it be extinguished?\nVimalakīrti said, “From stupidity there is affection, and hence the generation of my illness (or: the illness of self). Since all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why? Bodhisattvas enter samsara on behalf of sentient beings. Because there is samsara, there is illness. If sentient beings were able to transcend illness, then bodhisattvas would not also be ill. “It is like an elder whose only son becomes ill, and the parents become ill as well. If the son recovers from the illness, the parents also recover. Bodhisattvas are like this. They have affection for sentient beings as if for their own children. When sentient beings are ill the bodhisattvas are ill also, and when sentient beings recover from their illness the bodhisattvas recover also.”\nHe also said, “From what cause does this illness arise? The illness of bodhisattvas arises from great compassion.” Mañjuśrī said, “Retired scholar, why is this room empty, with no servants?”\nVimalakīrti said, “The countries of the buddhas are also all empty.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked, “With what was it emptied?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It was emptied with emptiness.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “How can emptiness use emptiness?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It is empty through nondiscriminating emptiness.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Can emptiness be discriminated?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “Discrimination is also empty.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should emptiness be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It should be sought within the sixty-two [heterodox] views.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should the sixty-two views be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “They should be sought within the emancipation of the buddhas.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should the emancipation of the buddhas be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It should be sought within the mental processes of all sentient beings.”   Teisho When Manjusri entered Vimalakirti’s room, it was empty of furnishings except for one bed. The state of mind of satori was overflowing everywhere. Vimalakirti welcomed him: “You did well to come, Manjusri, and even though you come, there is no coming. No sense of your having come. Nor is there any awareness in your mind of having arrived. Who appears is not to be seen.” When we visit someone and are wondering what to say, we are lost in delusion. Without thought, everything is huge and natural. It is not about wondering in advance what kind of greetings to make. This is how Manjusri came, totally naturally, and how Vimalakirti perceived, welcomed, and responded to him. This unattached way of seeing is the state of mind of satori.\nZen is not materialism, nor is it idealism. That which is being seen and that which is seeing it are one, a perfectly matched whole. In this the actuality is manifested; the world, as it is, is me. The world and I are not separate; there is no such division. When I see the world, where I am is clear, but if I don’t see it, then where am I? Where does the world go? If “I” don’t see the world, there is no “I.” This is the state of mind of zazen, the actuality, the world of Buddha nature and our original face.\n References [17][chapter 5]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

However, the illnesses of sentient beings arise from the four elements, and because they are ill I am ill.”  Teisho Manjusri asks Vimalakirti what type of sickness he is suffering from. Vimalakirti replies that the wounded state of society is the cause of his illness. A doctor can tell us if an illness has to do with our stomach, our kidneys, or our liver, but the body is not the cause of sickness in this case. Vimalakirti’s sickness has no form. Vimalakirti has forgotten his body, so physical symptoms are not present. And as for the cause being mental, our mind is like waves on the ocean, so how can that which is always changing be sick?

We reach a state where are not even thinking that we are doing something called “practice,” like an athlete who isn’t thinking that she’s making a great play or a musician who isn’t thinking that he’s making great music. In our daily life when we are doing our very best, our deepest and most effective work, we have forgotten our body and our thoughts completely.

Th e thoughts keep pouring in and pouring in and pouring in.\nIf it is something of form that we are trying to move out of our way, an object or material thing, we can just push it to the side, move it away. But in our mind it is so hard to push away a persistent thought. For this we have to use wisdom. Wisdom is something like a mother in a store with her child who is demanding that his mother buy a certain thing, even if he has to scream and shout until she finally gives up and does it. But a wise mother will simply, quickly, turn the child’s attention to something completely different. And suddenly the child will have totally forgotten that he was upset, and what he was upset about. Suddenly the crying stops while the new external interest is explored. We have to be able to liberate ourselves from the thoughts that we are caught on, or we cannot liberate others.\nReferences [21][chapter 6]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Sumeru, king of mountains, will remain in appearance as before, and the gods of the [heavens of the four heavenly kings and the Trayastriṃśa [Heaven] will not sense or know their own entry [into the mustard seed]. Only those one is trying to save will see Sumeru enter into the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the teaching of inconceivable emancipation.\n  “Also, [a bodhisattva] may cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single pore.\n“[The bodhisattva does so] without discomforting the ﬁsh, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the fundamental characteristics of those great oceans [remain] as before. The dragons, demonic spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into the single pore]. At this, the sentient beings [just mentioned] are not discomforted.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva residing in inconceivable emancipation who eradicates grasping of the great trimegachiliocosm does so just like a potter grasping a wheel in his right palm: were he to throw it past world-systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, the sentient beings within [that great trimegachiliocosm] would be unaware of where they had gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them would have any conception of having gone and returned, and the fundamental characteristics of this world-system would be as before.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire kalpa and cause those sentient beings to consider it a kalpa. If there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire kalpainto seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation can assemble the ornaments of all the buddha lands in a single country to manifest them to sentient beings.\n“Furthermore, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and ﬂy to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.\n“Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can make visible in a single pore all the articles offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions. Also, he can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions. “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can without physical harm inhale through the mouth all the winds of the worlds in the ten directions, and the trees outside [the bodhisattva] will not be damaged [by the winds].\n  Teisho If we simply open our mind to this truth of the Mahayaha, we can see what Vimalakirti is saying here. A parable in the Bible expresses this as well: “Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.” The seed is encased in a hard shell, just like the hard shell of ego that surrounds us. The shell needs to break for the seed to germinate and produce new life. Likewise, when a mother hen produces an egg and sits on it, if the shell is not broken through, the life inside that egg dies and rots. We all have this shell of an ego, and then zazen breaks through that shell and gives birth to our true self.\nSo how does this shell break? If we live for small and selfish goals it won’t break. But if we live for all beings, it naturally breaks away because that is not ego. Of course everyone naturally wants to be awakened from the origin. We understand this, and we also understand how, at about twenty months of age, we begin thinking in terms of two, not one. Because of that, an ego comes forth and we use that ego to learn and evolve and make a life. But also because of that understanding of two, there is conflict. To liberate ourselves from this dualism we have to give birth to a new wisdom, and there is always friction in doing this. As long as we continue protecting our small self, we will never break through that shell. We have to decide to use the infinite great energy with which we are endowed from the origin in order to awaken and to awaken all beings. Not just humans, but all life energy. It’s all one life. When we are separate and isolated we feel powerless, but when we connect and unite and know our oneness directly we know how to go beyond that powerlessness and awaken all beings.\nReferences [22][Chapter 6]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

This is the truest compassion. It’s not about having some special idea or intention involved with that giving. This true compassion is something we all have. It resembles wanting to give something from an egoistic expectation and intention, and maybe this is not a bad thing, but to spontaneously give without any agenda is the natural compassion. They look similar but they are not the same; it is about whether the ego is involved or not involved.\nIf a person is suffering, then we need to respond intuitively and directly to that suffering, and in that there is no past, present, and future. In this kind of deep compassion and love it’s not about time. And we don’t need to be accepted or thanked for our help. The bodhisattva is always in equilibrium, and there can be no conflict in our mind when we are manifesting and coming forth from true compassion. This is what Vimalakirti is saying.

When the ﬂowers reached the bodhisattvas they all immediately fell off, but when they reached the great disciples they adhered and did not fall off. Even using all their numinous powers, the disciples were unable to remove the ﬂowers.\n  At that time, the goddess asked Śāriputra, “Why would you remove the ﬂowers?”\n  [Śāriputra] answered, “These ﬂowers are contrary to the Dharma, so I would remove them.”\nThe goddess said, “Do not say that these ﬂowers are contrary to the Dharma! Why? These ﬂowers are without discrimination. Sir, it is you who are generating discriminative thoughts. If one who has left home in the Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is contrary to the Dharma; if such a one is without discrimination, this is in accord with the Dharma.\n“Look at the bodhisattvas, to whom the ﬂowers do not adhere—this is because they have eradicated all discriminative thoughts.\n“For example, when a person is afraid, non-human [beings] are able to control him. Thus, since the disciples fear samsara, then forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles control you. None of the ﬁve desires can affect those who have transcended fear.\n“It is only because the latent inﬂuences [of your afﬂictions] are not yet exhausted that the ﬂowers stick to your bodies. “For those in whom the latent inﬂuences are exhausted, the ﬂowers do not stick.”\nŚāriputra said, “Have you stayed in this room long?”  Answer: “I have stayed in this room as long as you have been emancipated.”\nŚāriputra said, “How long have you stayed here?”\nThe goddess said, “How long has it been since your emancipation?”\nŚāriputra was silent and did not answer.\nThe goddess said, “What is your great wisdom that you remain silent?”\nAnswer: “Emancipation is not to be spoken of, and so I did not know what to say.”\nThe goddess said, “Speech and words are entirely the characteristics of emancipation. Why?\n“Emancipation is neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Words are also neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Therefore, Śāriputra, the explanation of emancipation does not transcend words. Why?\n“All dharmas have the characteristic of emancipation.”\nŚāriputra said, “Is it not also that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity?”\nThe goddess said, “On behalf of the self-conceited, the Buddha explained that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity. If one is not self-conceited, the Buddha explains that licentiousness, anger, and stupidity are emancipation.”\nTeisho If you are awakened you can speak freely in order to bring this awakening to everyone. But this is what Sariputra is still caught on. We have to see what the Buddha has helped us to realize: that it is important for us not to stagnate in an initial understanding; instead we must continue in our state of awareness and deepen it. We don’t stop with knowing that we should not be caught on greed, anger, and delusion, but we live in such a way that we are not caught on them while seeing that within them there is also a way to further liberation. Don’t think about how you are awakened and become proud of that, but live from that awakened state in a way that others can learn from it. Vimalakirti is telling us that if you are still moved around by greed, anger and ignorance, or if you are still moved around by time, by space, and by acquiring, that is not true liberation.\nReferences [24][chapter 7]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

The examples are numberless, but what he is saying is this: the mind of this one moment has no clutter in it; do not become that state of mind where clutter gathers.\nVimalakirti is telling us not to be caught on our conditioned ways of behaving, not to see our behavior in the usual context, and not to follow precepts in the usual way, but when we see those who are suffering in pain, experience that in an empathetic way.

Ignorance and affection constitute this seed. Lust, anger, and stupidity constitute this seed. The four confusions constitute this seed. The ﬁve hindrances constitute this seed. The six entrances (āyatanas) constitute this seed. The seven loci of consciousness constitute this seed. The eight heterodox dharmas and nine loci of afﬂiction constitute this seed. The ten evil actions constitute this seed. In essence, the sixty-two mistaken views and all the afﬂictions constitute this seed.”\n  [Vimalakīrti] said, “Why is this?”\n[Mañjuśrī] answered, “Anyone who sees the unconditioned and enters the primary status [of Hinayana enlightenment] will be unable to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyak saṃbodhi.\n“It is just as lotus ﬂowers do not grow on dry land on the high plateau— these ﬂowers grow in the muddy ﬁlth of the lowly marshes. Thus one who sees the unconditioned dharmas and enters the primary status will never be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha. It is only within the mud of the afﬂictions that sentient beings give rise to the dharmas of a buddha.\n“Or again, it is like planting a seed in space, where it would never grow— only in nightsoil-enriched earth can it ﬂourish. In this way, one who enters the unconditioned primary status will not be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha.\n“It is only when one generates a view of self as great as Mount Sumeru that one is able to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi and generate the dharmas of a buddha.\n“Therefore, you should understand that all the afﬂictions constitute the seed of the Tathāgata. It is like not being able to attain the priceless jewelpearl without entering the ocean. Therefore, if one does not enter the great sea of the afﬂictions, one will not be able to attain the jewel of omniscience.”\n  Teisho If we are born with all of our limbs but do not know gratitude for them, then there is nothing more debilitating than that. This is the same as being endowed with a splendid mind but never awakening to that Mind. Vimalakirti says this awakening cannot be done by trying to look good in some prescribed way. He is not saying to avoid doing good things, but to not try to look good as you do things, to not put on a show of doing such good things and performing important good deeds. Do not be deceived by the behavior of those who are thinking of themselves and trying to appear as good people. That is full of ego! Rather, offer everything by throwing yourself into society. This is how true liberation takes place.\nIn this way Vimalakirti says that we cannot simply walk a conceptual path following in the footsteps of everyone else. We have to let go of everything to liberate all beings, or there will be no liberation. When our mind is not moved around at all, for the first time we can become one with the Buddha’s way.\nReferences [26][Chapter 8]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

At sixteen months, we for the fi rst time know that there is a me. And then at twenty-four months we know that this is divisible into two, a me and an other. And at thirty-six months we become dualistic in perceiving things. Initially, everything is perceived, and then we begin to judge and to evaluate. We don’t want to not benefi t in any situation. While our original mind is like this, it is also like a great round mirror mind, not narrow and limited. We are a moving life energy. We exist because of what that is. And that is what we are.

An ego comes into being because we develop concerns and ideas about the needs of the body. Worrying about health concerns, such as the cold weather and our state of health.

However, when we are feeling pain in our teeth, we notice it because our teeth hurt.

It is neither to transcend great sympathy nor to forsake great compassion, to profoundly generate the aspiration to achieve omniscience and never forget it even momentarily. It is to teach sentient beings without ever becoming tired, to be constantly mindful of following the teaching of the four attractions.

And each person has ego. In this ego and this body have greed and anger and ignorance. And when we go all of it will be gone as well. Holding on to any of it has no purpose. Bodhisattvas who care for this world, do not take any aspects personally. In general, people in society, work for their own satisfaction whereas bodhisattvas make use of everything for the awakening of all beings. At every step, we must throw everything away, seeing that the compounded is not different from the uncompounded. By deeply caring for all beings, we will not be toppled over by our ideals and can transform even our complaining into wisdom.\nAnd how do we liberate this world of the compounded when we are full of difficulties and differences, knowing that the world is full of delusion and phenomena? If we try to do this mentally, it won’t work, but when we raise the vow to achieve liberation by caring deeply for every being’s deep mind will this world be seen clearly and given liberation.

I neither view him as feeling, conception, process, or consciousness; nor view him as the suchness of consciousness; nor view him as the nature of consciousness.\n“He does not arise from the four great elements and is identical to space. He has no accumulation of the six sensory capacities, and his eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind have already passed beyond and are not within the triple world.\n“Having transcended the three deﬁlements, he is in accord with the three emancipations. Complete in the three illuminations, he is equivalent to ignorance.\n“He is neither the single characteristic nor different characteristics. He is neither a self-characteristic nor an other-characteristic. He is neither without characteristics, nor does he grasp characteristics.\n“He is not of this shore, nor of the other shore, nor of the current [of samsara] in between, yet he converts sentient beings. I view him in extinction, yet he is not permanently in extinction. He is neither this nor that, and he neither uses this nor uses that.\n“He cannot be understood with wisdom, nor can he be known by consciousness. He is without darkness (i.e., ignorance), without brightness (i.e., understanding), without name, and without characteristic. He is without strength, without weakness, and neither pure nor deﬁled. He does not occupy a region, nor does he transcend the regions.\n“He is neither conditioned nor unconditioned. He is without manifesting and without explaining.\n“He is neither charitable nor stingy, neither observant nor transgressive [of the precepts], neither forbearant nor angry, neither energetic nor lazy, neither composed nor perturbed, and neither wise nor foolish. He is neither sincere nor dissembling, neither coming nor going, neither exiting nor entering. All the paths of words are eliminated.\n“He is neither a ﬁeld of blessings nor not a ﬁeld of blessings. He is neither one worthy of offerings (i.e., arhat) nor not one worthy of offerings.\n“He neither grasps nor forsakes; he neither has characteristics nor is without characteristics.\n“He is identical to the true limit and equivalent to the Dharma-nature.\n“He is indescribable, incalculable; he transcends appellations and measures. He is neither great nor small.\n“He is neither vision, nor hearing, nor perceiving, nor knowing; he transcends the host of fetters. He is equivalent to the various types of wisdom and identical to sentient beings. He is without discrimination with regard to the dharmas.\n“He is entirely without failing, without impurity, without vexation, without intentionality (lit., “unconstructed”), without activation, without generation, and without extinction; without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without dislike, and without attachment; without past, without future, and without present.

If [one uses some] other contemplation, this is called the incorrect contemplation.”\nTeisho The bodhisattvas that accompanied Vimalakirti wanted to know what makes a Buddha. Gautama Siddhartha awakened to the truth under the Bodhi tree. For 21 days he deepened his awakening and then he considered how to share the truth of what he had realized. So he went to Sarnath where his friends with whom he had trained in austerities were staying. He taught, guided and awakened all of them.\nAt that time there was only the dharma and this small sangha, nothing called Buddha yet. Buddha means this historic person, and it also means something different that goes beyond history. The Dharma is the Buddha, not just a person at some point in history, but the Dharma is the Buddha. When Ananda asked when the Buddha was about to die, now what were they to do? The Buddha said, “Do not seek refuge externally. Seek refuge within. Do not seek refuge in external things. Take refuge only in the Dharma”. When the dharma is clear to us, everything is clear and right, to see the dharma allows us to resolve everything and to see how to be.\nReferences [36][chapter 12]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Although bodhisattvas die, they do not exhaust their roots of goodness, and although they are born they do not nurture the various evils.”\nTeisho All of the disciples of the Buddha, the great disciples, all of their wisdom together would have been only one sixteenth of the wisdom, of the great wisdom of Sariputra. And yet in this sutra he is often turned into the bad guy. Here, he is asking slightly flatteringly, in what world had Vimalakirti lived before, what great world, because his wisdom was so great and it continues.\nWhen we see a movie we are only seeing it as real while we watch it. When it is over we don’t think the things in the movie are continuing going on and are real and actual somewhere. And this is the same with everything in our environment and with our bodies as well. But instead of seeing this clearly as it really is, we put down that person, we get bothered by this person, we can’t stand having to see this person. Yet while we know all of it is phenomena we also still have to hold each person and meeting precious and know that it is a rare occasion.\nOn knowing that, this is all phenomena at the same thing, at the same time, not thinking that each and everything is worthless because it’s phenomena. Not holding on to attached feelings about this phenomena either. But that would be the same as being attached to things in a movie.

They are in fact words spoken by the head tea master, Murata Jiko, when the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa asked him, \u0026ldquo;What is the mind of tea.\u0026rdquo;\nMurata Jiko answered succinctly, \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo; Since then, these words have been thought of in conjunction with tea.\nNo matter what else might be said about the world of human relationships, it needs to be peaceful and tranquil. When it is not, people are unstable and insecure. But what is this peace?\nThe first part of the kanji for peace looks like a mouth surrounded by many things to eat. Kanji is truly thorough! Even a baby is happiest and will stop crying when it can put its mouth to a breast. Any group having a meeting will do better with something to eat and drink. For any gathering to go well, we need something there to put in our mouths.\nThe second half of the kanji for peace looks flat and balanced. It is because things are not flat and balanced that the world descends into confusion. Some people have too much, while others don't have enough. This disparity is what causes conflict. We can't look at this only conceptually. If all 6.3 billion people actually had equal amounts to eat, they could be peaceful and harmonious. It is our responsibility to see that that happens. Yet just saying peace, peace, peace and trying to help by holding meetings is not sufficient. Harmony also requires respect for each person's deepest character. Then we are like friends, intimate not just in form but with each other's deep character. This is the level on which we must be intimate. Regardless of our class or caste or culture or language, we're all humans, and we have to respect each other's deepest character, or it won't work.\nWe have to feel this respect not just because we are told to but because we have a clear mind to respect with. Otherwise it is only a ritual. If our mind is not truly balanced, we can't respect others in a balanced way. That clear mind also has to receive what all people have to say, in all kinds of situations, or the things we encounter will confuse and twist us and make us unstable and insecure. No matter what comes to us from the outside, we must have an essence that is not moved around by anything. If we are not as peaceful as the bottom of the ocean, it is not true peace. That is why we need \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nThese words and ideas have been used for many centuries, teaching that in our human relationships, we find peace by respecting each other's deepest character. In the Lotus Sutra there is the story of Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva, who did not recite sutras or sit zazen but prostrated to everyone he encountered, saying he had deep respect for them and they would become a Buddha. He prayed to each person, but those who were prayed to didn't think they were so worthy of respect. Because they disliked themselves, they would get angry and spit at him and hit him and yell at him. But he would simply reply, \u0026ldquo;I have a deep respect for you; I see in you the deep Mind of Buddha.\u0026rdquo; This Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva was one of the Buddha's past lives.\nIt is said that any religion that isn't like this won't last. Religion can't be just a matter of praying to a God. We must find and awaken to our deep godlike potential. This must be realized deeply and then polished and respected in each other.\nTea House The empty room of Vimalakirti where Manjusri comes to inquire of Vimalakirti's illness is said to be the source of the tea house, tea ceremony and the tea garden. This way of tea ceremony, with its spare hermitage-like tea room and simple garden was begun by Tea Master Rikyu. He did long years of practice and zazen and from his deep power of vow he taught that the first priority in the training of tea is to intimately study the Dharma. He taught this himself and he was always creating a context of how it is in the zendo, and also that the tea garden should maintain the simplicity of a Zen temple garden.\nThis is Rikyu’s own way of teaching, and it was this very hut of Vimalakirti which was the model for Rikyu’s teahouse. When Vimalakirti took everything out of his house, leaving only one bed where he lay, this way of being is a way of expressing one’s own life. The tearoom is usually the size of four and one half tatami mats and outside of the tea room there is a small simple garden. The four and one half mat room is the size taken from the Vimalakirti Sutra; the small simple garden comes from the teaching in the Lotus sutra. The room in which Vimalakirti lived was a square, four and one half tatami sized room, and this is the same as the word for a head priest of a temple. It is a little larger than nine feet square, with the addition of the tokonoma and a wooden board; this is just the size of four and one half tatami mats.\nOne Buddha land. Buddha lands are not about space, but about being one complete world, three meters square. In the case of the tea room, we purify our senses before entering it, rinse our mouths, and put away our worldly thoughts and ideas. We enter the room with a quiet focused minds. Usually, about three or four people can fit into a tea room comfortably. But if there are no mental, dualistic ideas to restrict and make it narrow, it is not difficult for a three meter square tea room to hold eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, and one hundred thousand gods and goddesses. We can all enter if we think about it. Rationally it may seem impossible. But since it is the whole great space in that room, it is an infinite size.\nAt the doorway to the tea ceremony room a fan is placed on the tatami, marking a definite entrance. Then we go to the tokonoma, the place where even in a regular house we find a space for our mind to become settled. Our house is a place to rest our tired body, but it also has to be a place to find peace and a settled mind. The One Drop Zendos’ are also places where we can respect each other and find peace. The tokonoma was originally a Buddha altar, and that is why incense is offered to the Buddha's words that hang there, and light is provided to light those words and our travel. To the right is a candle, to the left is water, and in the middle is an incense burner.\nHung in the middle of the tokonoma are the Buddha's or Patriarchs\u0026rsquo; phrases. They always hang there, providing a place of refuge for our mind. The words are a resting place, a staff for our mind, so we can sit down silently. In the tea room the tokonoma is for bowing to and honoring, not as a matter of form but from the true depths of our mind. If we always do that with respect for all people who share this same deep mind, we will all be awakened to that.\nThen we look at each tea utensil very seriously, examining it and seeing the value in each one. The beauty and the flavor of each has to be looked at carefully to see its highest quality. We can't just look vaguely, there is no exchange of mind in that. A scholar of justice once said to his students, \u0026ldquo;Do you know that justice and law are the most feared subjects? But they are only about respecting society and the people in it, not about studying punishment. You have to see all things clearly before you start this study. Go and see things that were used as tools before the time of Christ, look at things in the museums and how they were used. You have to learn how to see things deeply. If you can't pray for the best for society, you can't understand justice. We have to study all things and see them well to know what will be useful and best for each person.\u0026rdquo;\nWe look carefully at each individual tea bowl. We touch the life energy of one flower in a vase. We smell the incense and feel the warmth of the water, and there our very mind's depth is warmed as well. Not as things but as real live people we greet these utensils, and our deep respect grows and is cultivated.\nAs we give our mind to each and every thing, we know the source of peace and harmony. It is not only about respecting people and character, but so often we can't even do that. We are always judging the ways of others or their past deeds or their bad habits. We are always looking at their weaknesses. But if we do that we can't truthfully respect them. As Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva did, we have to let go of all ideas of good and bad before we can truly respect someone, and we can't enter the tea room sincerely unless we are peaceful in our own mind. We must have a mind like a mirror that simply reflects and does not judge. Then we can see in the same way as God, who gives rain equally to good people and bad, and realize that we have that very same mind inside us.\nVimalakirti is the one who gave birth to the tea room garden, a small garden outside the tea room that is like the one written about in the Vimalakirti Sutra. Vimalakirti's room is called a hojo. It is the size of four and one half tatami mats, just big enough for a human to live in the least possible space. Vimalakirti was sick in such a room when Manjusri came to visit with many Bodhisattvas, but there was nothing at all in the room. Vimalakirti was just burning incense and waiting. In the tea ceremony as well, nothing extra is added. There is only the fragrance of incense and flowers; everything else is empty. Thus is the empty mind of the tea master expressed. The guests purify themselves by washing their hands at the rock basin and then enter with a purified mind.\nJapanese used to go to nature in the mountains repeating, \u0026ldquo;Six Senses Purified, Six Senses Purified.\u0026rdquo; All of the senses and the whole body become pure when we climb a mountain. We see the mountain, and our eyes are purified. Hearing the birds, our ears are purified. We drink the clear river's water, and our mouth is purified. We sweat, and our body is purified. We climb the mountain and think nothing at all, and our mind is purified. In this way, we make all of our senses pure. This is the purity of \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is where the ideas and doctrines of all religions return to the pure source of true religion. For all religions this idea of purity is important, or it is not true religion.\nYet we also have so much past experience and knowledge. As Bankei Zenji has said it, \u0026ldquo;That old barrel\u0026ndash;if we burst the bottom out we have three barrel staves and one empty circle or enso.\u0026rdquo; We are so full of emotions and past experiences and ideas that are so interesting, or so frustrating. Those ideas are fine when they arise, but if we keep piling them up our mind becomes like a tank filled with methane gas. We must not let that make us dark and heavy. That ego sludge at the barrel's bottom has to be burst through. All the sides then fall away, and there is only that circle of the bottom of the barrel. One circle, our true pure clear mind, the mind of God, humans\u0026rsquo; original mind, which is empty like a mirror, pure and clear.\nWe have added things to that original mind and lost sight of its clarity. If religion is necessary at all, it is to let go of what we have become stuck on and awaken to our original mind. For doing just this we have zazen. When we let go of everything we have accumulated, we can see directly what is actually there. Then we can use our experiences and knowledge without mistake, for all beings and for all of society. For this we have to purify that mind, this clear \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the Buddha said, we have to extinguish the flames of greed, extinguish the flames of ignorance, and extinguish the flames of anger, and then we will know nirvana's tranquillity. If we realize the true source of our mind, we know this pure and clear place, and from there we respect all beings. This is the source of peace for the whole world.\n\u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nNot just for tea ceremony, but as the source of peace for all humankind.\n \u0026ldquo;Vimalakirti meets Manjusri in his \u0026lsquo;tea room\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;\n ","id":47,"length":2244,"title":"Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity","type":"entry","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/catalogue/44/"},{"content":"a few short words here\n","id":48,"length":5,"title":"The Vimalakirti Sutra","type":"contents","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/"},{"content":" Taigan Shodo Harada Roshi       Taigan Shodo Roshi (born 1940) is a Zen teacher, successor of Yamada Mumon Roshi, received his Dharma transmission in 1982 and became the head abbot of Sogenji Monastery in Okayama, where he has been teaching mainly foreign students since then.

The Mahayana vehicle is for all to get on a ride together: to create this great faith that we are endowed with this wisdom from the origin and that we work from it. We work from it by expressing it as that vow to put our life on the line for the realization of all beings. This was the strength of the Mahayana, which is to polish this wisdom deeply, and with that which we can know and see from that polished wisdom, to then bring that wisdom to all people. This is the way that it came to be and will continue into the future. And those who are of sincere and true devotion to wanting to keep this teaching going, proceed in this way to completely polish and fulfill the wisdom that is within us, and always keep our deepest vow of bringing an end to the suffering for all beings.\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that this can be done by people who are working in society, having regular lives with families. It is for this reason that the Mahayana tradition has the approach that it can be done by everyone, not just by a few ordained people. All of us we are endowed with and hold this wisdom. The point is for it to be realized and then to live in accordance with it. First of all we have to clarify this wisdom, and then we learn how to live that truth in our daily lives, learn to work and create things without, for example, damaging the environment.\nThe source of all the problems is that we get caught on our ego-filter. Ego and ego-perspective—this is what undermines our efforts and makes things difficult. To be able to see what it is, to be in a world without being moved around by and ruled by this ego—that is what we must do.\nThis wisdom which is being taught here is the wisdom which appears to be two but which is not two separate things. As Dogen Zenji has written it poetically, “Foolish me! I’ll never become closer to the Buddha, just going further and further away.” We have to offer everything to society, and without being concerned about our own work, to instead bring what we realize through our wisdom to all beings. Jumping into that aspect of it, we purify everything. This is the teaching—the truth—of the Mahayana.\nAt the base of these many slogans is the deep wisdom of the Mahayana, as expressed here by the teachings of Vimalakirti. Vimalakirti, who was living in society in the midst of everyone living the life of society, was never caught by the things people are usually caught by—livelihood and family life. He was not clinging. He was always correcting others for being moved around, especially chiding the Buddha’s disciples, not just by criticizing and trying to improve them, but also in ways that would teach them to have a broader state of mind: that work of realizing the True-nature in every single thing we do. This was the functioning of the pure wisdom of Vimalakirti, who aptly had two other names, “Purest Name Bodhisattva,” and “No Defilement Bodhisattva.”\nThere are two other names for the Vimalakirti Sutra as well. One is “The Inconceivable Liberation Sutra” and the other is “The Rebirth Liberation Sutra”. These two names show how this sutra, in particular, goes beyond all of the paradoxes which it brings up, resolving them by becoming much more huge, expansive and embracing of the questions of the paradox and, in this way, making the truth come clear.\nPeople in society usually put a great value on having money, but here Vimalakirti is placing that side by side with the value of living the truth, saying: look at the differences, look at the value of each. We can come to see how this is possible when we read the words in the section called “Liberation” —the Liberation section of this whole sutra which is also called the Liberation Sutra.\nSome people want to drink sake, or they want to follow their own interests and impulses so they can get anything they want. Rather than getting caught like that on the views of a small ego and in that way separating from other beings, how much better to live in a way where we are using our life as a place of practice in every thing we do. Not caught on anything at all, we let go of our deepest attachments and see the place that is untouched by that clinging!\nIn society we need to bring to the fore our ability to offer ourselves for other people rather than trying to get what we personally prefer. To do that we have to know how to ‘kill’ our selfishness completely. But we are always getting caught by thinking of ourselves as a small self which is limited by ego and an ego view. Because we can’t let go of that, we get caught and choked by some narrow vision of who we mistakenly think we are. To let go of that we have to do zazen and learn to not be moved around by always thinking about how others are regarding us. And we do zazen to learn to discard the small self version of what we think we are and what we think we want most—let go of that for a bigger picture which is more true.\nWe do zazen so that we are not caught by and stuck on this limited egoistic version of ourself as a human body and to see that we are not small-minded. We have to do zazen so that we are also not limiting other people. and to see that. We imagine a version of our human life as the person who is alive between a certain birth and a certain death; we imagine this is who we are. Through zazen we come to see that while this is one part of it, there is a much greater part as well; we are not limited by something called being born and dying.\n       Expand   We have to ‘kill’ our small, egoistic self completely in order to let go of that stuck, ego view. All of the ancients passed through this, and we, too, have to free uourselves from our egoistic view and awaken to what is best for everyone! For doing this we have to die and be reborn in a completely true way. If we can die totally in this way, then we can see the place of rebirth. We have to push ourselves into it, to dig in and actually die completely in order to be able to understand and realize that name of this text which is called “The Inconceivable Rebirth.”\nBuddhism is not for making me stronger, for making one’s own self-centered, egoistic view more central. It is to become the person who is not moved around by anything that anyone says to us. It is only in not becoming that person that we are insufficient. To see what we can do when people are criticizing us or putting us down—to what degree can we not be moved around by that whatsoever—to see this place beyond our egoistic perception where we’re not caught on ourselves as what is being talked to and what is being put down, to step away from that and know that that is not the whole picture—it is for this that we do our practice.\nTo live in a world where there are the phenomena of birth and death without being caught on those phenomena whatsoever, to always be smiling in spite of that, to not be clinging to that piece of the whole picture. To know failure, to know success, to know winning, to know losing without being caught on any of them—this is truly Inconceivable Liberation. As long as we are alive, we have desires; we have things that are affecting our body. While experiencing all of that, to not be upset or caught on any of it in an egoistic way—this is truly the Inconceivable Liberation.\nVimalakirti’s sutra today would perhaps be called something like an opera or a drama with all kinds of props, all kinds of scenes, all kinds of characters. We have the Buddha coming in, bodhisattvas, devils, heavenly angels, all coming and going in order to suddenly awaken us. It may seem like an opera right in front of us, but in this way we can see the truth and suddenly become awakened in a new way.\nThis opening section is about letting go of the small self. So how do we do that? This is what Zen is teaching us; it is that teaching that makes us know how important it is to let go and let go and let go of it right now. All people have this ego-attachment. It’s very strong, even in children and in old people. It is most deeply set there, in their wanting to have what they want the most. But we know that we have to get old. To let go of that ego view right now, while we are still young!\n","id":50,"length":1564,"title":"The Vimalakirti Sutra: On the Purpose of this Sutra","type":"essay","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/intro/"},{"content":"The primary translation used for the Vimalakirti Sutra is from John McRae.\nSome calligraphy were taken from the 6 volume \u0026ldquo;Staff for Mind (Kokuro No Tsui)\u0026quot;, privately published between 2000 and 2006.\n McRae McRae, John (2004).

Kinsoku Buddha, for the sake of all beings, borrowed the form of a bodhisattva. To do this, he borrowed the form of a lay person, Vimalakirti. Kinsoku Buddha appeared as a lay person who had a presence in society, who was working in society, and who had a family life. This was a person who would show that all people are able—regardless of their way of life, whether they are ordained or not ordained—to realize True nature. And so we have the layman Vimalakirti.\nThe Sutra of Vimalakirti is one of the sutras of the Buddha, along with the Lotus Sutra and the Shomon-gyo [Brahma Excellent Thought Sutra]. These sutras come from the years after the Buddha had awakened, when he took what he had realized and went everywhere, teaching and guiding, until he entered Nirvana in the grove of sala trees. This all took place 2500 years ago. The central teaching of the Mahayana or Greater Vehicle is for everyone to polish their wisdom, and while polishing one’s own wisdom to also guide others with the wisdom that is manifested. The Mahayana vehicle is for all beings to get on and ride together: to create this great faith that we are endowed with wisdom from the origin and that we work from it by expressing it as the vow to put our life on the line for the realization of all beings. The strength of the Mahayana, is to polish this wisdom deeply, and with that which we know and see with that polished wisdom, to then bring that wisdom to all people. This is the way that it came to be and will continue into the future. And those who are sincere and truly devoted to keeping this teaching going, proceed in this way. Completely polish and fulfill the wisdom that is within us, and always keep our deepest vow of bringing an end to the suffering for all beings.\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that this can be done by people who are working in society, having regular lives with families. It is for this reason that the Mahayana tradition has the approach that it can be done by everyone, not just by a few ordained people. All of us are endowed with and hold this wisdom. The point is for it to be realized and then to live in accordance with it. First of all we have to clarify this wisdom, and then we learn how to live that truth in our daily lives, learn to work and create things without, for example, damaging the environment.\nThe source of all our problems is that we get caught on our ego-filter. Ego and ego-perspective—this is what undermines our efforts and makes things difficult. To be able to see what it is, to be in a world without being moved around by and ruled by this ego—that is what we must do.\nThis wisdom which is being taught here is the wisdom which appears to be two but which is not two separate things. As Dogen Zenji has poetically written, “Foolish me!

Jumping into that aspect of it, we purify everything. This is the teaching—the truth—of the Mahayana.\nAt the base of these many slogans is the deep wisdom of the Mahayana, as expressed here by the teachings of Vimalakirti. Vimalakirti, who was living in society in the midst of everyone living the life of society, was never caught by the things people are usually caught by—livelihood and family life. He was not clinging onto anything. He was always correcting others for being moved around, especially chiding the Buddha’s disciples, not just by criticizing and trying to improve them, but also in ways that would teach them to have a broader state of mind: that work of realizing the True nature in every single thing we do. This was the functioning of the pure wisdom of Vimalakirti, who aptly had two other names, “Purest Name Bodhisattva,” and “No Defilement Bodhisattva.”\nThe Vimalakirti Sutra has two other names, one is “The Inconceivable Liberation Sutra” and the other is “The Rebirth Liberation Sutra”. These two names show how this sutra, in particular, goes beyond all of the paradoxes which it brings up, resolving them by becoming much more huge, expansive and embracing of the questions of the paradox and, in this way, making the truth clear.\nPeople in society usually put great value on having money, but here Vimalakirti is placing that side by side with the value of living the truth, saying: look at the differences, look at the value of each. We can come to see how this is possible when we read the the next chapter called “Liberation Techniques” or “Skillful Means”.\nSome people want to drink sake, or they want to follow their own interests and impulses so they can get anything they want. Rather than getting caught like that on the views of a small ego and in that way separating from other beings, how much better to live in a way where we are using our life as a place of practice in every thing we do. Not caught on anything at all, we let go of our deepest attachments and see the place within that is untouched by that clinging!\nIn society we need to bring to the fore our ability to offer ourselves for other people rather than trying to get what we personally prefer. To do that we have to know how to ‘kill’ our selfishness completely. But we are always getting caught by thinking of ourselves as a small self which is limited by ego and an ego view. Because we can’t let go of that we get caught and choked by some narrow vision of who we mistakenly think we are. To let go of that we have to do zazen and not be moved around by always thinking about how others are regarding us. We have to do zazen to learn to put down what we want most, what we think we are—let go of that for a bigger picture which is more true. We do zazen so that we are not caught by and stuck on a limited egoistic version of ourselves as a human body, and to see that we are not small-minded. Also, we have to do zazen so that we are not limiting other people. We imagine a version of our human life as the person who is alive between a certain birth and a certain death; we imagine this is who we are. Through zazen we come to see that while this is one part of it, there is a much greater part as well; we are not limited by something called being born and dying.\nWe have to ‘kill’ our small, egoistic self completely in order to let go of that stuck, ego view. All of the ancients passed through this, and we, too, have to free ourselves from our egoistic view and awaken to what is best for everyone! For doing this we have to die and be reborn in a completely true way. If we can die totally in this way, then we can see the place of rebirth. We have to push ourselves into it, to dig in and actually die completely in order to be able to understand and realize that name of this text which is called “The Inconceivable Rebirth.”\nBuddhism is not for making one stronger, for making one’s own self-centered, egoistic view more central. It is to become the person who is not moved around by anything that anyone says to us. It is only in not becoming that person that we are insufficient. To see what we can do when people are criticizing us or putting us down—to what degree can we not be moved around by that whatsoever—to see this place beyond our egoistic perception where we’re not caught on ourselves as what is being talked to and what is being put down, to even step away from that and know that that is not the whole picture—it is for this that we do our practice.\nTo live in a world where there are the phenomena of birth and death without being caught on those phenomena, to always be smiling in spite of that, to not be clinging to that piece of the whole picture, to know failure, to know success, to know winning, to know losing without being caught on any of them—this is truly Inconceivable Liberation. As long as we are alive we have desires; we have things that are affecting our body. While experiencing all of that, to not be upset or caught on any of it in an egoistic way—this is truly the Inconceivable Liberation.\nVimalakirti’s sutra today would perhaps be called something like an opera or a drama with all kinds of props, all kinds of scenes, and all kinds of characters. We have the Buddha coming in, bodhisattvas, devils, heavenly angels, all coming and going in order to suddenly awaken us. It may seem like an opera right in front of us, but it is in this way we can see the truth and suddenly become awakened in a new way.\nThis opening section is about letting go of the small self. So how do we do that? This is what Zen is teaching us; it is that teaching that makes us know how important it is to let go and let go and let go of it right now. All people have this ego-attachment. It’s very strong, even in children and in old people. It is most deeply set there, in their wanting to have what they want the most. But we know that we have to get old. To let go of that ego view right now, while we are still young! That shows us how important it is to give everything we can to doing this sesshin.\nDay Two\nThe first section of the Vimalakirti Sutra is “The Purification of Buddha Lands.” The version that we are working from is the translation from Yoshin Sanzo Kumuraju [Kumarajiva]. First given in India, the original text is not known, but while there were seven varieties of translations in existence, this is the one which we will be using and which is considered to be the most excellent.\nA Buddha land—this is a place where all people awaken, and from that awakened state of mind a land comes forth. It is not about people dissatisfied with material things and carrying their personal standards and values around—the things that they want—but about realizing the laws of our state of mind and awakening to what is within in the deepest way, seeing that which is splendid in each and every human being. People who are coming from this place—what kind of a country would this become?\nSutra Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the garden of Āmrapālī near Vaiśālī, in the company of a great congregation of eight thousand bhikṣus. There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, recognized by the congregation.\n“Thus have I heard at one time” is the way true sutras begin. At the time of the Second Great Assembly, five hundred years after the Buddha died, the Assembly—following the original assembly at the Cave of Parakutsu where Ananda spoke and corrected and added to the remembering of the sutras by the five hundred arhats—at this time these sutras which were declared to be correct were all beginning with “Thus have I heard at one time.” The arhats had brought the sutras, and then Ananda, who had memorized them all in his twenty-five years with the Buddha, told what the Buddha had said. So it was a combination of efforts from both Ananda and the arhats that made these sutras as clear as possible. Āmrapālī was a mango grove given to the Buddha by a wealthy family. The man had died, and his wife became a nun following his death. This was very unusual at that time. They gave the land to the Buddha and built a temple there. This becomes the stage for the play of the Sutra of Vimalakirti. There are 8,000 bhikṣus there, all saints, and 32,000 bodhisattvas.\nSutra Of bhikṣus there were eight thousand, all saints. They were free from impurities and afflictions, and all had attained self-mastery. Their minds were entirely liberated by perfect knowledge.\nEveryone who had gathered were awakened to deepest wisdom, and awakened without mistake. Most important is that wisdom that comes forth in the Four Vows, the vows which we read every day, the truth of the Way of the Bodhisattva. Sutra Sentient beings are numberless: I vow to liberate them. Desires are inexhaustible: I vow to put an end to them.\u2028The Dharmas are boundless: I vow to master them.\u2028The Buddha’s way is unsurpassable: I vow to become it.\nTo seek this truth for all people, never stopping, to work always from our deepest understanding, to know what needs most to be done, is what is important. But first we have to awaken to that wisdom within. We gather information in our life, which brings us what we call knowledge. We use that knowledge with our spacious, expansive mind to be able to understand what is true. And that combination brings deep wisdom. To be able to know all beings’ truest source—from here also comes wisdom. If it is only knowledge it can only turn into a narrow, rigid, dualistic view. Instead, to realize that wisdom is the most important and quickest way to bring realization to all beings. It was people who were aware and wise in this way that had gathered here at Āmrapālī.\nIn this sesshin as well, we are here to awaken to our wisdom—that source of the Buddha’s wisdom—one and the same source in all of us.\nThat mind which is also like poisonous snakes, gangs of thieves, or wild animals in its behavior—we never know what our mind is liable to come out like; it could even be something that could send us to prison. But if we look carefully, we can see that we also have, prior to that, a mind of great wisdom. And as the Buddha says, if we gather everything in our mind into One there is nothing we cannot realize.\nThose who work with water or those who work with various elements or crafts—they also work with the mind. They don’t just work with the material to specialize in what they make and do; they always know to work with the mind in order to best use those materials, because that is at the bottom of all of it. So to put all of our mind, as the Buddha said, into one simple, single direction and keep our focus strong in that direction—always doing it with the greatest intention.\nSutra They were free from impurities and afflictions, and all had attained self-mastery.\nIf we let go of all things we are connected to on the outside and free ourselves from all concerns within, then our mind becomes like a tall, straight wall and we are at one with our Path. Or as the Sixth Patriarch has said, to perceive things which are external, we don’t add on any extra thoughts of good or bad. And when we notice anything within, we let go of any judgment or idea about it. Rinzai Zenji says it: “In this five-foot lump of red flesh there is a true person of no rank which is always coming in and going out. If we haven’t seen it yet, see it now!” We are not doing the sesshin here casually, just coming and doing whatever we feel like doing. We take the rules of the ancients and, with the same care with which they provided them for us, we continue and realize that deepest wisdom in the doing of sesshin.\nThe ancients follow the deepest, most profound wisdom. It is from here that society must be brought forth. Each person has to realize their True nature, and then from there see how they themselves are the actual creator of the society. Making sure that no one is in trouble or in pain, taking care of everyone—knowing it is our own responsibility to see that everyone is taken care of—and then to see that it is to bring forth this clarified world that we are born for. To awaken to our own wisdom and then to share this wisdom with others.\nIn the Dhammapada, the words of the Buddha himself, it is said, “How rare it is to have the opportunity to be born as a human being. We forget this so easily!” We still take it for granted. People say that humans are the most evolved and advanced forms of creation. Humans are able to realize this true wisdom. While being born a human, to realize this is a fortunate birth—to keep aware of that! And also, to keep aware of the fact that all of us die; we will die. The Buddha is teaching this, saying this in order to inspire and encourage us to use the inner abilities with which we are all endowed in different ways—to not waste that precious time of being alive but to make use of our time and make use of the abilities and talents with which we are blessed. How rare it is, in a world of deepest darkness, to be able to bring forth light. We receive the Dharma, we receive that wisdom, and we know that we cannot kill even one single insect. Not because of a rule that has been told to us, but because we know, from our deep wisdom in understanding our own life energy, that all life energy born into this world is equal. So how could we kill a single insect?\nWe each have this deep mind within. But not all of us have found the entrance for realizing that wisdom which comes forth from it. This great wisdom we have within is no different from the wisdom of the Buddha. To realize and express this wisdom is the point. We are not a small-minded ego that makes us into two people, but that great, wise mind that includes all of our egoistic facets as well. All of this is included in our wisdom. And then with this deep wisdom we are able to reveal a deep ability which rests within all of us. We have to see that, experience it and then use it for the awakening of all beings.\nFifteen hundred years ago Shotoku Daishi wrote the first constitution—the oldest constitution—and the first of a number of things written there was that harmony was best. We have to have peace, or we will not only be unhappy, but everything—the whole world—will dry up. We have to take the Three Treasures [Buddha, Dharma, Sangha] and see them clearly, and respect and revere them. And only there, from giving them our deepest respect, can we wholeheartedly create. There are many different countries, and we cannot try to rule other countries; we cannot have heads of countries that try to rule other countries. Rather, we should observe the rules of mind and respect each country’s way. To see that and respect people from all countries and what they’re doing, we have to let go of our ego view. As long as we are egoistically driven, we cannot see clearly. Rather, to be able to say, “I am so glad I was born!” Without awakening to that true source we cannot see others clearly, accept them and forgive them.\nThis great Mind—we are all this mind, even before our parents were born, prior to anything genetic affecting us. If we can liberate that narrow idea of a personal stance, we can understand all people. There is not something called the Dharma somewhere. As Dogen Zenji said on returning from China where he had gone to look for the Dharma, he had found no such thing as a Buddha Dharma, but what he had found is that the eyes are horizontal above a vertical nose on the face. He did not see anything called “Dharma.” But he had seen from that true source. What had he seen from that true source? He had seen “that the sun rises in the East and the moon sets in the West, that the roosters crow at the break of dawn and every four years a Leap Year comes around.” For this world to be, the natural ways have to happen. And who has destroyed these natural ways now? It’s humans with their ignorance and their selfishness. If we were to live from the place where we see that “there is a sun rising in the East and the moon setting in the West, the roosters crow at the break of dawn and every four years a Leap Year comes”—this is the true Law, and it cannot be opposed, but humans have been doing so and it has been a big mistake.\nThe Three Treasures need to be respected and the truth has to be clearly seen, not as a matter of form, but so that we do not work in this mistaken way. To open our mind completely to see and become this, is what the Vimalakirti Sutra is teaching us.\nDay Three\nToday we are continuing to read about the Buddha lands. Everywhere the Buddha’s teaching is heard—that is a Buddha land. It is not a physical location or country but a state of mind with a deep understanding of human nature. Building a Buddha land is not like building a country with a society and systems for how to run a country. The Buddha land is the care of the mind—living in the best place for everyone. This is the place where, because people have so much greediness and seeking of self-satisfaction, they are not usually able to reside. But there is a perfect state of mind, and this needs to be clarified for it to be called the Buddha land.\nSutra There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, recognized by the congregation. 3. The [bodhisattvas present] had all accomplished the original practices of great wisdom; were established by the numinous charisma of the buddhas; maintained the correct Dharma for the defense of the Dharma city; made their names heard throughout the ten directions through their ability at the lion’s roar; befriended and pacified people without being requested; exalted the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) and were thus able to keep them from being cut off; subjugated the vengeful Māras and controlled those of the heterodox paths; We here have the bodhisattvas who are attending, knowing the teachings to be pure. Our mind is always getting attached to something and losing its freedom. The ego comes in and puts a lid on our hugeness of mind. So what is it that puts that lid on?\nFor what are we born? To be a realized Buddha and awaken to that deep wisdom within. To be able to remember that the universe (which came into being 16 billion years ago), the earth (which came into being 4.5 billion years ago), and then the Life energy from which we come, all came into being just once. It began just once and it has to complete itself, to fulfill itself, to where all beings are awakened to this deepest wisdom, with no one left out. For this all of us have to be abundantly-minded beings. To become this, we have to know shame in not evolving in the way that we could. Humans can see what we are still lacking and see what is still unevolved in ourselves, what is still unawakened in ourselves. This is a particular quality of human nature. Seeing this makes us regret that we haven’t evolved further. And because we have this regret, we know the shame of not doing everything we could. That makes us work harder, go further with what we have not yet seen clearly. The Buddha said to his disciples who were always sleeping, to not waste that precious life energy but to realize their true, deep wisdom. To do this we have to put everything into it, throw ourselves entirely into it, and to use the least amount of time possible for sleep.\nLosing track of ourselves and clinging to someone else instead of deeply realizing our greater being, we stay caught in a small self. And in that small self version, we always hold back, not wanting to give everything, not being willing to dive in completely; so instead we hold onto someone else.\nTo become angered easily and quickly; to not see clearly through everything that is in front of us and that which we experience; to have an ongoing upset and discordant mind; to have an ongoing angry mind even if it isn’t being expressed; to have a depressed and un-free way of looking at things; to become overly-indulgent in our sleeping. These are the things that hold us back.\nThe Buddha was a very wise psychologist and taught many helpful things like this. The bodhisattvas that are being talked about here were all free from these indulgences and weaknesses. These bodhisattvas who were gathered had all done their homework, and they were all free and realized in these many different aspects. One of these aspects was that in each and every mind-moment they were fresh, there were no shadows lingering. And so every world they would find themselves in was seen clearly.\nWe are always adding on dualistic ideas to what we perceive, and that is what is impure. To perceive in a way that is correct for what we are looking at, to be not adding in anything that is extra, is what is most important.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present] ... were entirely purified and had forever transcended the impediments (i.e., afflictions); There are five indulgences and ten weaknesses. Those five indulgences are indulgence in greed, in anger, in sleep, in agitation, and in doubts. The Buddha was always teaching about how we cannot waste time. We have been given this precious life, and our time is like sand, slipping through our fingers. We have to see this clearly and not waste it by sleeping any more than is absolutely necessary.\nWe have greediness for sleep; we have anger and irritation; we have doubts and suspicions about things, including the teachings; and we also have indecision—not being able to see clearly and see through to what we have to do and what is around us. And we also have the ten fetters that hold us back. We have the bond where we do not see the lack of wisdom in our actions. We don’t see ourselves clearly and are unable to be embarrassed or ashamed or regretful of what we’re doing. The second is that we don’t review our behavior; we live as our animal side encourages us to, and instead of seeing that as holding us back from evolving into our higher potential, we don’t have any sense of that being something needing to be examined, reviewed, or changed.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present]... maintained their minds always in peace and unhindered emancipation; were unfailing in their mindfulness, concentration, dhāraṇī (i.e., memorization of the Dharma), and eloquence;\nThe second characteristic of the bodhisattvas is to have a Pure mind that is always clear, not worrying and concerned about what might happen in the future, but staying in the present. This is to not leave anything remaining in our state of mind instead to be completely present in each moment. Next, we have the words “to not do bad things” but to instead “do good things”—to live in that clarified state of mind.\nThese ways of being come to us of their own, and we are naturally bright and abundant then. We do the practice of becoming completely whatever we are doing. In the zendo we become the zazen completely. If it is cleaning, we become the cleaning completely. If it is eating, we become the eating completely. And then our mind is not flaccid and does not get caught or attached easily.\nOne person said that they were walking in the temple grounds when two monks suddenly met on a path. Without speaking aloud, they bowed deeply to each other and then continued walking. This clear and clean way of relating to people—if it is not like this, we are always wondering what is the meaning of practise, what we are practicing for?\nThen there is the way of speaking clearly, simply, and to the point; for example, welcoming and sending off guests with a few appropriate words fully expressing our gratitude that they have come, but not just flattering people and saying what we think they want to hear. Rather, to honor each and every moment of encountering.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present] ... were replete in charity (dāna), morality (śīla), forbearance (kṣānti), exertion (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), wisdom (prajñā), and the power of skillful means; had attained the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas and the nonattainment [of all things];\nThe Six Paramitas are listed—that of charity, of following the precepts, of patience, of good efforts, of samadhi, and of deep wisdom. The first is charity: to make offerings to each other makes our mind and our world harmonious; in this way we will believe in each other. These can be both Dharma offerings or material offerings. The Dharma kind of offerings come from within, like the offering of wisdom. The material offerings are things of form. There is also a third: the offering of fearlessness, like that state of mind of many babies. The baby offers a fearless mind and a deep smile, and there is no one who is not touched by the purity of that state of mind. Because we always offer these to each other, we can believe in and have deep faith in each other.\nWe give things, but we also give what are not material things, such as a look with kindness in our eyes, a state of mind of being and speaking which is not jagged and nasty. To be kind in our way of speaking and being. To have a supportive and cooperative state of mind. It all has to be done with our deep mind expressed there, and to give our clear, bright mind freely and charitably. This is how we offer everything to society.\nWe all have challenges and painful matters, but we offer all of that right up to society as well. If we can do this, we will naturally know how to behave. In this way the world works. As they say in an expression from China, “What goes around comes around.” We support each other in this way on our Path—that deep Path of Clear mind. Then we have the second Paramita which is the Precepts. Like planting seeds in the spring and harvesting in the autumn, the precepts follow natural laws. To be able to plant the seed, offer it sunshine and rain, and bring forth its harvest—this is a natural support for the seed. In the same way we observe the precepts of the heavens and the earth. For humans these are the precepts, for example, of not killing life, not stealing, not lying, being clear and bright in our relationships, and not being intoxicated. To not destroy life, to not take things and call them our own personal things, to be direct and clear with all people, to not be confused and deluded by alcoholic beverages or by other things either— not to be intoxicated by using too many things, not to be intoxicated by drinking things in a way that makes us unclear and confused.\nWe have to have patience, the next of the Six Paramitas. For realizing deepest wisdom, we have to endure at times. When we get old and sick we need this practice of having known how to become patient. Having that patience we can realize the necessary spaciousness of mind. Patience is basic for this, and we have to work on this creatively.\nNext we have making efforts, like those in all things of nature. And the same is true of our own efforts.\nWe have samadhi. All the other five paramitas come within this. As the Sixth Patriarch has said, to not add on anything—any judgment or idea of good and bad—to what we perceive externally, since it is all just phenomena. Instead to realize this ongoing, transformative flow by diving in, yet not being attached to, what we are encountering. This is samadhi. We so easily get harried and agitated. We have to keep our ki low, keep it down so we can be settled no matter what comes along, and forget our body and our thoughts completely to where we no longer realize any separation between ourselves and the zendo, for example—our five senses and the world around us matching perfectly. This is true wisdom—meeting each encounter with no seam between self and other, self and what is being met. In all the boundless realms of space there is not room for a single hair to be inserted.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present] ... were able to accord with [the truth] in turning the irreversible wheel [of the Dharma]; understood well the characteristics of the dharmas and understood the capacities (lit., “roots”) of sentient beings; had attained fearlessness in sheltering the great congregations; cultivated their minds with merit and wisdom; were paramount in the adornment of [537a7] their bodies with the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks; Further, to not be caught on a small personal sense of who we are. As Daruma Daishi said in his writings on The Two-Way Entrance to the Path, there is nothing to be possessed whatsoever. In the Buddha’s teachings on the Fourfold Truth, the first truth is that our suffering comes from gathering; we gather friends, we gather things, we gather ideas. To not gather and to not be attached is the way to be free from suffering. As Daruma Daishi also said in his profound precepts, from the deepest, most profound, Clear mind and True nature, there is nothing that belongs to us whatsoever. As Ikyu Zenji said in his final words, “This body which I have borrowed for these many years, up until this time, this day, I now return it.” To make this body useful for many people instead of selfishly wanting it to be something which owns many things personally, and not to speak and think in terms of “my things,” “my land,” “my doings,” “my possessions.” To get things, people even kill and steal, when they are not our own in the first place. And in the doing of that we lose track of our True nature.\nIf we open up to our mind as it is—just as it is—then we will see this world just as it is. This is the spacious way of mind beyond any attachment whatsoever. If we see beyond the possessiveness of things, then we see that even the ugliest and angriest person we know will also die like we will. And seeing from this spacious state of mind—this is the true way to encounter and meet each thing and person.\nOh great Mind, It is impossible to measure the height of the heavens!Yet the mind is above the heavens. It is impossible to measure the thickness of the earth, Yet the mind is below the earth.\nThe sun and the moon shine with a great radiance, Yet the mind is the source of that radiance. Within the mind the four seasons open in their sequence.\nWithin the mind the sun and the moon move. Oh great Mind!\nThis is from the writings of Eisai Zenji. To realize this huge state of mind is zazen. And if we can realize this, then we can live in our True nature.\nVimalakirti is using this section on the purification of Buddha lands to teach this ideal way of being and living. We each have to see this within and align accordingly. This is how it is clarified here.\nDay Four\nThis teaching about the construction of Buddha lands is not about the construction of a physical form. If our minds are peaceful and harmonious, these are also Buddha lands, and the Buddha land which is a form becomes peaceful and harmonious. More than the material form of a Buddha land, that form is the quiet in our mind; we are each then that place of Buddha. And what is the mind’s Buddha nature? How do we receive it? If people in the world suffer, then we are also sick. In this way there is no difference at all between the world—the society—and how we are. It is the same with the Buddha lands. Always with those who are not yet awakened, helping them to awaken! And then the Wheel turns. It always works much better when there are at least two people doing something that is as big as this. And in this way we meet people and we do it together, and then things come together in the best possible way.\nWhat is the truth? What is that which each of us has to work on? If we look within we can see that we’re still needing to work on different places and how we’re still lacking in deeper awakening. People who lag behind have to be encouraged to go faster. People who are carelessly fast—we have to help them and support them to slow down and be more careful. People who are very slow, to remind them how life passes so quickly. To show the place where fear is not necessary, so that each person can, without fear, awaken and join forces and help each other. There is no place where everything is already aligned. There is always work to do. We work on it together; we support each other and we bring these things into alignment.\nPeople are all alike in that we each think that we are the most special person. Even though we say that we are so lacking and terrible, actually, deep inside we believe that we are the most adorable. If we are ignored we get confused and upset.\nThe Buddha also said that it is up to us to align our face and our appearance—the Buddha, who was spoken of as having thirty-two special marks and eighty special features. We have to do this from within. It’s nothing you can achieve from trying in an external way, it is not like becoming more like a movie star’s face. Instead, become the face that no matter how difficult a situation we have to face, to be not moved around and to have a still face that is in clarity. The Buddha said that to work on our patience is of great importance. To not get angry and to keep our face aligned—to let it all go; no matter what the pain and suffering, to stay settled and clear.\nWe have in the United States a story from Abraham Lincoln’s time at the end of the Civil War. There were not so many people around to help out with things, and good people were hard to find. There was a person whom a friend of Abraham Lincoln suggested that he could use for his work. But when President Lincoln met him, he turned him down. His friend was curious and asked why he didn’t want to use that person who was so brilliant and able to work so well. President Lincoln said, “I didn’t like his face.” So his friend said, “But his face came from his parents—that’s not his fault.” President Lincoln answered, “Yes, but who is it that is carrying that face? One who does not care about others has the kind of face that shows that they don’t care about others. As the President of a country I have to see what is best for everyone. It’s not about my own personal choice in who is around me.”\nAnother person once said that life is a workshop for making one’s face. Tolstoy, the famous author who wrote War and Peace—a huge, complex masterpiece. Someone commented that for Tolstoy as well, more than his great writings, his best work was his face. He had a face that was moved by nothing. He called this face Tolstoy’s true masterpiece. To be humble, to be helpful and see what we can do best for other people, and of course, in the doing of that a good face comes.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present] ... had dispensed with worldly adornments; were known above and beyond even Mount Sumeru; were firmly resolute in faith like vajra (i.e., diamond); illuminated the Dharma jewel everywhere and rained down the sweet dew [of the Dharma]; were paramount in the subtleties of the host of [spoken] sounds; profoundly entered into conditioned generation to eliminate the false views; were without any residual influence of the two extremes of being and nonbeing; The bodhisattvas are those who let go of all decoration and adornment. People so like to dress with decoration and adornment, where to dress for hot or cold or a special occasion should be plenty. People even put on evening dresses costing thousands of dollars. But bodhisattvas don’t wear clothing like that. The Buddha had three robes—for hot weather, cold weather, and for speaking on special occasions in front of other people. These robes and one set of eating bowls were all he had. And everything else was given to society. For his clothes he used what others didn’t need anymore and discarded. Always keeping what he wore clean, using a strong cloth, letting go of the weak parts and then sewing it together to be strong and designed to support the places where it would get weak from wear, carefully patching and cleaning, and not wasting any cloth. This pattern that he sewed his robes in was called “clothing of fortunate rice field pattern.” Always wearing quiet, simple, clean clothes, he dressed this way and lived this way. So he was believed in and respected.\nHe was always polishing his state of mind, and in this way he was a refuge and a mirror for all people and for society. He was always polishing—an exemplary person for all people in society. This is the way of finding joy in the truth. He would find great joy in this deep wisdom, and naturally want to share its joy and happiness with other people. So no matter what, he was sharing this joy of the Dharma. Usually our precious possessions are things and objects, and that is our way of making ourselves happy. Instead, be happy without things and know the deeper joy of being alive. If we are near a person who is like that we are able to receive their serenity. We feel it. The first time we feel it we are deeply impressed. And just sitting down together, this quiets us. The quietness is received and deepens.\nSutra [The bodhisattvas present] ... preached the Dharma without fear like the lion’s roar; preached with reverberations like thunder; were without measure and beyond measurement; were like ocean captains who had collected the many Dharma jewels; comprehended the profound and wondrous meanings of the Dharmas; understood well the past tendencies and [current] mental processes of sentient beings; approached the unparalleled autonomous wisdom of the Buddha, the ten powers, [the four] fearlessnesses, and all the eighteen exclusive [attributes of the Buddha]; had closed all the doorways of the evil destinations but were born in the five destinations in order to manifest their bodies there; were great medicine kings who were good at healing the various illnesses; provided medicine according to the illness and caused it to be taken; were accomplished in all the immeasurable merits; had ornamented and purified all the immeasurable Buddha lands; unfailingly used what they saw and heard for the benefit [of others]; and never squandered away their endeavors. Thus were they entirely replete in all merits.\n[The Roshi] has a friend who is the head of a police department. He does zazen every morning before he goes to work, chanting the heart sutra—not even looking at a paper or any kind of news or having any other kind of input before he gets into his car and goes off to his office. And when he goes into this big office, again before he even looks at the paper or the work of the day, he goes immediately to the jail and he says “Good morning!” to the people there. They are very annoyed about being there in the first place and they don’t answer, just a cold, resentful silence at first. After three days or so, a slightly less resentful, mumbled answer of “Good morning” is returned. And after a little while more, if he doesn’t come, then they ask where he is that day. After two or three weeks he leaves a newspaper for them; they say they don’t want to read anything like that, and they refuse it. And awhile after that, a book about mind, something which is deeply meaningful. Eventually they pick it up and read it; they get it, and they like the book and they ask for more books like that. They had never seen such a book, didn’t know they existed, having read only the parts of the newspaper they liked up until that time. It takes time. But more and more, if there is a Clear mind it will be responded to by another Clear mind.\nThe Buddha’s teaching about the world was that everything comes forth in accordance with cause and effect. He taught that there is nothing absolute in the whole world; everything, without exception, is always changing and in flux. So how do things change, and in what way does this change occur? There is always a source, there is always a cause. And about that cause and about that source, there are many conditions that affect it. In accordance with the conditions that affect that source, that cause: from there a result comes forth. Things will always change in accordance with this. Like the plants: we plant a wheat seed in the ground. That would be the first cause—planting that wheat seed. Then we have the conditions that it needs to grow, such as the right amount of rain and sunlight. Then we get a sprout; that’s the result. But there is nothing eternal about this. The Buddha was very strongly opposed to two theories: one, that there is an ongoing, continuing, after-death soul; and two, that there is nothing at all. Rather, he said that there is a cause, there are conditions, and the result of those, and these keep changing. Not to say there is a something, nor to say that there is not anything at all, but rather there is this formula in which we have a cause, conditions that affect that cause, and the results. This cuts away all egoistic ideas of nihilistic flavor or of believing in an eternally continuing something.\nWith our various experiences we continue to clarify True Mind. We keep the center clear. Although we read and study, instead of getting caught and dragged down by what we read and study we have to ask, “What are they really trying to say?” and see through to the greater point. If not, then we will lose any real meaning in what we are reading and studying. The bodhisattvas could see through all of this, and in that way were like the fishermen who know where all the fish are, or the people who know where the treasures are buried. Like people who go fishing under the instruction and intuition of one who knows the waters well—a fisherman who has fished them often—the bodhisattvas know well how to guide people in this way.\nThe Six Realms through which people rotate—we have the Realm of Hell, in which it is impossible to believe in anything; the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts, of always wanting more and more no matter how much we have already been given; the Realm of the Human, to always be reviewing our behavior, ashamed and embarrassed about what we have done but able to work and improve on it; the Realm of the Demons; the Realm of the Heavenly Beings, forgetting everything and spending time pleasantly, yet still in that place where there is no deep, continual awakening. And so again we return to go through the others again and again, always revolving around these realms. But as we move through these states we simultaneously work on clarifying our True Mind. In this way, we come forth from that deep mud of attachment to become like a pure lotus. While we are still full of greed and terror and anger in the various realms, the bodhisattvas see this clearly and give the appropriate medicine for us to be able to move through those realms and let go of the attachments.\nWhile working, to not even think that we are working; in some way, whatever way, to liberate others all the time, in one straight line, standing, sitting, waking, sleeping—never stopping. This is the way of the bodhisattva. Never ending in their deep vow to help all beings become liberated, these are bodhisattvas. Those who were gathered there were bodhisattvas, and those who can build a Buddha land are bodhisattvas. As they gathered, the land of the Buddha was being built of itself. A person once asked Confucius—and it must have been a very clever person—“What is necessary for a country to stand?” To this, Confucius answered, “The military, food, and deep faith.” It must have been a very clever person indeed, because they continued, and they asked, “If you could take away one of those things and still have a country to stand, what is the first thing you would take away?” To this, Confucius answered, “The military.” And then he said that the second was food—if only one thing could be left it would be the deepest faith. Without that faith the country would not last for one day. Today it seems to have become just the opposite. We have a lot of military, a lot of food, and no faith in our government at all. In the Buddha land we have the deepest faith, and it is in accordance with that that the karmic affiliations are strengthened.\nDay Five\nContinuing, we have the pages that have all the names on them:\nSutra 4. Their names were Equivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Inequivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Equivalent-Inequivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Autonomy of Meditation King Bodhisattva, Autonomous Dharma King Bodhisattva, Dharma Characteristic Bodhisattva, Radiance Characteristic Bodhisattva, Radiance Ornament Bodhisattva, Great Ornament Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Jewels Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Eloquence Bodhisattva, Jewel Hand Bodhisattva, Jewel Seal Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Raised Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Lowered Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Lamenting Bodhisattva, Roots of Joy Bodhisattva, Joy King Bodhisattva, Eloquent Sound Bodhisattva, Store of Space Bodhisattva, Holding the Jewel Torch Bodhisattva, Jewel Courage Bodhisattva, Jewel Vision Bodhisattva, Indra’s Net Bodhisattva, Illumination Net Bodhisattva, Unconditional Contemplation Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Wisdom Bodhisattva, Excellent Jewel Bodhisattva, Heavenly King Bodhisattva, Destroyer of Māra Bodhisattva, Lightning-like Virtue Bodhisattva, Autonomous King Bodhisattva, Ornament of the Characteristics of Merit Bodhisattva, Lion’s Roar Bodhisattva, Sound of Thunder Bodhisattva, Sound Striking the Mountains Bodhisattva, Fragrant Elephant Bodhisattva, White Fragrant Elephant Bodhisattva, Constant Exertion Bodhisattva, Unresting Bodhisattva, Wondrous Birth Bodhisattva, Flower Ornament Bodhisattva, Contemplates the Sounds of the World (Avalokiteśvara) Bodhisattva, Attains Great Strength Bodhisattva, Brahmā’s Net Bodhisattva, Jewel Staff Bodhisattva, Undefeated Bodhisattva, Ornamented Earth Bodhisattva, Golden Crest Bodhisattva, Pearl Crest Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī Dharma Prince Bodhisattva—there were thirty-two thousand such as these.\nLater, in the chapter on “Not Two”, the bodhisattvas are introduced more specifically. Here we just have them named, and only some of the 32,000 which are said to have been there. Actually, only the senior and most remarkable ones were named here for this teaching of the Buddha. Now the Buddha is going to arrive, just like the Himalayan mountains rising high above at Gion Shoja where the Diamond Sutra was also taught. All the disciples at first were gathered around the Buddha, and around the disciples were the bodhisattvas, and around the bodhisattvas were all the gods and the protector beings.\nSutra 5. There were also ten thousand Brahmā heavenly kings, Śikhin and others, who descended from the other worlds of four continents to proceed to where the Buddha was in order to hear the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand heavenly emperors (i.e., Indras), who also came from the other worlds of four continents to sit in this assembly, and the other awesomely powerful gods (devas), dragons (nāgas), yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, who all came to sit in the assembly. The bhikṣus (monks), bhikṣunis (nuns), upāsakas (laymen), and upāsikās (laywomen) [also] came together to sit in the assembly.\n6. At that time the Buddha explained the Dharma for the congregation of immeasurable hundreds of thousands surrounding and revering him. He was like [Mount] Sumeru, the king of mountains, rising high above the ocean. Peacefully seated on the many-jeweled lion seat, he towered over the great congregation of all those who had come there.\n7. At that time there was an elder’s son in the city of Vaisali named Jewel Accumulation [Ratnakara]. He and five hundred other elders’ sons proceeded to where the Buddha was, holding canopies made of the seven treasures. Reverencing [the Buddha’s] feet with their heads, they all simultaneously offered their canopies to the Buddha.\nFive hundred sons, led by one wealthy man’s son, all from illustrious families, each brought a parasol made of seven different kinds of jewels because they were sons of wealthy families. India is so hot, the umbrellas are about two meters in width, with a long handle which is then laid down and able to give shade. They are still used today. This offering of parasols is still practiced, which [the Roshi] has seen when he was in India.\nWith both elbows and both knees and the forehead to the ground, prostrations are given to the Buddha nature; it is not to some Buddha statue or some image of a Buddha—not to anything external to be thankful to — no such symbol. This is why at the One Drop Zendos we always have a great circle [enso] which we use instead of having a Buddha image or statue. Prostrations express our honoring and our realizing of the Buddha nature.\nSutra 8. The Buddha’s numinous charisma made the jewel-laden canopies all turn into a single canopy, which covered the entire tri‑mega‑chiliocosm, yet allowing all the characteristics of the breadth and length of this world to appear within it. Also, all the tri‑mega‑chiliocosm’s Mount Sumerus, Snowy Mountains, Mucilinda Mountains, Mahāmucilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jewel Mountains, Golden Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Ring Mountains, and Great Iron Ring Mountains; the oceans, rivers, streams, and springs; the suns, moons, and stars; the palaces of the gods, the palaces of the dragons, and the palaces of the honored gods—all these appeared within that jewel-laden canopy. Also, the buddhas of the ten directions, as well as the buddhas’ preaching of the Dharma, also appeared in that jewel-laden canopy.\n9. At that time the entire great congregation observed the numinous power of the Buddha and exclaimed in praise of its unprecedented [quality]. They held their palms together and reverenced the Buddha, gazing up at his revered countenance without interruption.\nAs soon as these precious parasols had been laid down, suddenly, by the miraculous power of the Lord, they were transformed into a single precious canopy so great that it formed a covering for this entire billion world galaxy. The surface of the entire billion world galaxy was reflected in the interior of the great precious canopy, for the total content of this galaxy could be seen: limitless mansions of suns, moons and stellar bodies, the realms of the devas, ragas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas as well as the realms of the four Maharajas.\nThe Buddha was offered these parasols, which he took—all of them—and gathered into one great parasol, as if with a sleight-of-hand magician’s move. All the heavenly gods then appeared. All the five hundred parasols gathered into one—the whole universe was then gathered there. Being given a precious parasol was an offering to the Buddha which represented the deepest, greatest faith and sincere mind of each of the young people. Buddha put these gathered, offered minds into one great Mind. All people have this one great Mind which is like a huge circle; the Buddha brought them all together into one.\nOh great Mind, it is impossible to measure the height of the heavens!Yet the mind is above the heavens. It is impossible to measure the thickness of the earth, Yet the mind is below the earth.\nThe sun and the moon shine with a great radiance, Yet the mind is the source of that radiance. Within the mind the four seasons open in their sequence.\nWithin the mind the sun and the moon move. Oh great Mind!\nThis great Mind with which we are all endowed—if we try to put it out there, it just comes out as an ego-expression about it. Yet even though we cannot put it out, it is, as Master Rinzai has said, “The true Dharma has no form, and yet it extends in all the ten directions.”\nJust as that moon high in the sky is written about in the Zen Phrases, if we have ten thousand bodies of water, in them there will be ten thousand moons. If there are a thousand bodies of water, they will also all reflect the moon. The moon will be reflected in the water, but only if the water is not turbulent. This is not about the water’s content, but about whether or not there are waves in it. If there are, then it cannot correctly reflect the moon; like our mind, when it has many thoughts it cannot perceive precisely. When we are serene and without any ideas in our mind, then the moon in the high heavens can be reflected in the water exactly as it is. If our mind is clear like that—clear like that clear circle, that huge circle—that can be reflected there. If that is enlarged, then it becomes the whole universe. Yet it is not empty. It holds onto nothing, yet it reflects everything precisely. Everything in this universe—even the smallest and largest thing—is reflected there. Our mind becomes one and the same with what it reflects if there are no obstructing thoughts. The same for the Buddha and the same for now: “In all the boundless realms of space, there is not a place for a single hair to be inserted.” But if we add on anything mental, or hold on to it, it does not reflect clearly. This is the truth.\nHaving received the parasols, the teaching of the truth was given, showing it by example with the gathering of the parasols and their becoming one. Then, in this particular style and quality of the Vimalakirti Sutra—how it comes through the eyes and is taught visually as well as through the hearing—everyone saw the actuality of what the Buddha was talking about by what he did. Everyone attending was awakened by this truth and, as is the custom in India, a gatha or a song was then given:\nSutra 10. At this the elder’s son Jewel Accumulation proclaimed in verse before the Buddha:\n1. Your eyes are pure,\u2028And as large as blue lotuses; Your mind is pure, having mastered the concentrations.\u2028Long have you accumulated pure action—you are immeasurably praiseworthy; You have guided the congregation with serenity, and therefore\u2028we bow our heads to you.\nThe Buddha’s exquisite appearance is extolled here. The blue, lotus-like eyes—actually a blue-white-ish color in the actual blooming lotus of this sort. With eyes the shape of a lotus petal, his appearance is praised.\nNot a single speck of anything in his Clear mind, he would always enter his teaching from samadhi. This was from his lengthy becoming; a Buddha is not suddenly produced. Such was Amida Nyorai, for whom it took three long kalpas to become Amida Nyorai. The Buddha, who had thrown away everything, whose path began by letting go of a whole life as a prince, of dear family at a castle, his wife and child, that whole country, in order to go to Dantoku Mountain where he did ascetic training for six years, eating one grain of rice and the pine nuts that were there until on the eighth of December, at the age of thirty-five, he was deeply awakened. His struggles were immeasurable up until that time. But from that time on he was always in samadhi.\nIn describing the long time that the Buddha trained, it is said that he did eight thousand trips back and forth to the furthest ends of the universe. It is said that he did this training for all of us. He shaved away his body and his being for all of us, and we cannot misuse this precious chance we have been given to be able to deepen our understanding. The central point of this is always deep serenity. Today in so many religions they have moved away from that serenity using bright images, loud music and synthesizers. Yet see how even in martial arts before they begin the practice of their forms they sit quietly, silently. We also can’t just sit our body down while having a busy mind. Both our body and mind being serene—this is zazen. And so it becomes this deep state of mind.\nSutra 2. We see the Great Sage use numinous transformations To manifest the immeasurable lands throughout the ten directions, Within which the buddhas preach the Dharma, And we thus can see and hear them all!\nThe Buddha had rolled all of the parasols into one, showing the oneness of all things. Like today when we have computer screens where we can see the whole universe on them. In the olden days we took one moon, one sun, one galaxy, the planets, and stars, and this is one Buddha land. Each Buddha land has one Buddha in it, and these are written about to show the huge expanse of this, of what is being included here.\nSutra 3. The Dharma power of the Dharma King surpasses all other beings, And you always give the wealth of Dharma to all. Well do you discriminate the characteristics of the dharmas and remain unmoved within the cardinal principle. You have already achieved autonomy with regard to the dharmas, and therefore we bow our heads to you as Dharma King.\nThe Dharma king is Shakyamuni Buddha, who has realized the whole truth completely and therefore can teach appropriately to anyone and everyone, whether they are sad or unhappy or miserable. In the whole world, having all of the possible ingredients necessary to liberate all beings—that happening because he can see the truth so deeply and thoroughly—we give great honor to him.\nSutra 4. You explain that the dharmas are neither extant nor non-extant, Although the dharmas are generated from causes and conditions;\u2028That they are without self, without creation, without experiencer, Although good and evil karma is also not extinguished.\nThese words have already been given—how it is the Dharma of karma affiliation. The Dharma has three standing parts, ways of being put. The first is that about existing. There has to be a color for something to exist, or we cannot perceive it. Light and shade is necessary for this. And so we use the word “color” to mean that something is perceived. Since it has a color, we can recognize it; it has rules that we recognize—the way something exists—as a bird, or as a fish. A bird is something which flies, a fish is something which swims in the water. Each and every thing has a color and rules about what and how it is being. Also, everything is constantly changing, never staying the same, never stagnant. All existence is in flux: all the flowers, the running rivers changing continually. We think that rocks look so permanent, but they, too, change with the raindrops falling on them. One drop after the next in the same place, and the rock becomes smaller. So there is color and form and change, and these rules are rules for what exists.There is always movement. Nothing can be fixed. There is no exact beginning nor an exact ending. In India, those objects made of matter were thought to come forth from the four elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. These elements were the source of all things; everything would come under these categories. If we take a plant seed and plant it in the ground under the best circumstances and we have the water and the sunshine, then we can continue to bring forth these seeds endlessly, if we continue giving them their best circumstances. The Dharma is like this. So is the flower. While it exists, it also does not exist. It exists in one form but it is not that form eternally. This existence is something which appears to be existing. But in fact it is always going through change. The rivers flow and we have the sky as it is. While never stopping changing—it’s not about a “good” or a “bad”—that is the way of the laws of all existence.\nSutra That they are without self, without creation, without experiencer, Although good and evil karma is also not extinguished.\nWe have a house, but in fact there is no such thing which can be extrapolated from that which is a house. It is, in fact, a combination of—a collection of—parts of a house. There is a roof, there is a floor, there are walls and windows, but there is no such thing as a house—only its parts that are gathered together. This is true of all of us. We are only our parts. All of our definition is in the listing of our parts. We are parts. We are cells. We are cells that become bones, we are cells that become lymph fluid, or cells that become organs or become blood or parts of a brain. We are all only our parts. There’s nothing that can be shown that is called a “me,” nor can it be called an “I.” There is not a becoming, nor is there an existing thing which is a “me” or an “I.” All of us are simply a collection of the various parts. And there is no god who creates it. We appear to exist but before that gathering of parts there was no such “me” existing. Our physical body comes into being with a karmic cause that brings all of these parts together, and we also fade away through karmic cause.\nThen if we are not existing, what is it that moves? That which moves through us—that is called karma. Whether it is a good collection or a bad collection, that is according to the karmic affiliation—like energy, which also has an effect but cannot be seen. And this energy’s activity does not ever change in any era; the rules of how it works are always the same in every era. Karmic affiliation does affect it. So if we have a vow to build a Buddha land, that does affect how the energy works. It also is an aspect of the karmic affiliation. To gather all these parts together in the best possible way—this is what the gatha is teaching us.\nWe are what we think, having become what we thought; Like the wheel that follows the cart-pulling ox, Sorrow follows an evil thought.\nWe are what we think, having become what we thought; Like the shadow that never leaves one, Happiness follows a pure thought.\nThese are the first and second stanzas of the Dhammapada’s linked verses— that good causes bring good effects, bad causes bring bad effects. It’s up to us what we choose and decide. If we go on to describe the essence of that Dharma, it is all beings, which are ever changing and without fixed form and shape. All things are in constant flux and there is nothing that is eternal. Therefore, for all things it can be said that they don’t exist either, there is no absolute existence. However, we can say that it is that very constant change, that flux, that does exist. No matter what kind of thing it is, it goes through changes, it is in motion, in flux. If it has color, moves, and works according to a law, it has existence—this is the definition. Buddha said that all things that have existence are governed by the laws of cause and effect.\nIn existence there is always a cause, and with the addition of the karmic connection a result is born. This result becomes the next cause; karma is added and the next result is born from that. All things are tied together by a vast karmic connection and only appear to exist separately. When that karmic connection is completed it returns to the original “ku” or “void, emptiness”. This is why it can’t be said that things absolutely exist, nor can it be said that they don’t exist. In a temporarily borrowed form, they stay in flux, changing constantly, with no concrete or fixed existence. For this reason, in this world there is nothing which controls and nothing which is controlled, only the working of the continuing laws of cause and effect.\nThis is what the Buddha taught—these are the natural laws that he realized are at work and taught about. At the same time the Buddha understood well how this physical body also comes forth from karmic causes; how it is affected by karmic causes, and although it seems to exist, that Mind which thinks of itself as an “I” is also something which only comes about from karmic causes; in other words, there is no such thing as an “I” that has an absolute existence.\nFor those who have actually experienced this for themselves, there is no longer any confusion about this transient world, this deluded world. If we see from these eyes, there is no such separation or differentiation as a “self” from an “other.” “Self,” “other,” they are all of an equivalent world that is not created and not controlled, from before the beginning of the limitless past, the rules of cause and effect are simply perpetually in constant motion. For this reason, since there is no separation between self and other, society is always our “self”; our “self” is always society. This actual experience is understood and realized.\nIn the world of Zen, we don’t think of God or Buddha as providing us with our food. As we live within society, we have to ask ourselves if we really made the efforts that deserve this food. We must understand the great amount of energy that was necessary to bring that food to us, to be thankful for all those benefits that made our meals possible. For us to thoroughly chew and digest the actual reality in front of us; this must be the essence of our training. The Buddha would not even permit an imagination of a world like this. He was free from ego attachment which could attempt to control him. There was also no absolute being who imagined this world. The teaching of the Buddha on cause and effect showed that karma was the form of expression through which these are disclosed. Karma is not the existence of some certain special thing. Since things exist in this world according to a cause and its effects, if we plant good seeds we can get a good flow moving. If we plant bad seeds they bring forth a bad flow. The words “good causes bring good results, bad causes bring bad results” come from this. Today’s environmental problems can all be explained by this. Until now we have only been interested and demanding on behalf of our own happiness and pleasure; since we were only chasing after our own narrow satisfaction we’ve contaminated the planet, changed the temperature balance to make it too warm; contaminating the planet continually we’ve brought about all varieties of problems in the environment, leaving problems everywhere around us. Yet the Buddha, when he was practicing his ascetic way under the tree, battled those same temptations, that ego which would attempt to control him, and in doing that he forged a Path for us to be able to know how humans can and should live going beyond all dualism. Experiencing Nirvana he threw off all the tangled desires of lust, greed, love, hate, reaching that place of brilliant light, the place full of the joy of the Dharma.\nIn this way he saw through it all. We might need to ask here, if this doesn’t exist, then what is the true center, the true master? This truth—this living energy, that which is actually alive—what is it? We want to know what it is—it is that which existed before the narrow ego of a small self came forth. This is merely given the borrowed or temporary name of “mu” or “ku.” This is how it is explained, that most Clear mind, that clear Pure mind prior to ego—that totally purified awareness. For example, we have Muso Daishi, the founder of Myoshinji–Sogenji’s headquarter temple. After he was enlightened he spent eight years in the isolated countryside of Ibuka, hidden away from public attention, taking care of the daily tasks and doing errands for the village people in this rural area. During the day he would work in the rice fields and at night he would do zazen with energetic efforts. When this zen master’s teacher died, he had left last words that Muso Daishi would, of course, follow carefully. The emperor at this time, Emperor Hanazono, was looking for Muso Daishi to become the emperor’s own teacher. This same Muso Daishi, also known as Kanzan Egen Zenji, was called by the emperor to Kyoto three times, and each time he turned him down. Finally, when he was told that it had been his master’s final orders that he should teach the emperor, he obeyed his teacher’s orders and prepared to go to Kyoto. The people of the village were astounded—this man who was now to become the teacher of the emperor—they’d been using him to run their errands! They were terribly embarrassed and ashamed. Finally the day of parting arrived—they went to send him off—and no matter how far along the way they went with him, they just couldn’t bear to part and say good-bye. The elderly couple with whom he had been the closest said: “If we had known we had such a wise person with us, we would have asked for your teaching. We are an old couple and we can’t understand anything difficult, but isn’t there something which you could teach to even us? We would like to hear some of your excellent teachings which you might be able to share with even us old people.” On hearing this Egen-san said: “Of course! Fine! Just come over here and stick your heads out!” Thinking he was going to teach them some wonderful teaching, they both stuck their heads forward, waiting for this precious teaching that they were expecting. Egen grabbed the hair on the back of their heads, pulled it up, and pushed their foreheads against one another. When he did this they both cried out “Ouch, ouch! Ouch!! Why did you do this?” “That’s it! That’s it! That’s it! That’s my teaching for you! Just now you said `ouch!’ but not because I told you I was about to hit your heads together leading you to expect something. Did you even once think about it? That `ouch!’ came forth without a single thought, without any expectations at all—did you think ‘this is going to hurt!’ or did you expect it even the slightest bit? That ‘ouch!’—where did you learn to feel that? “You didn’t learn that anywhere, did you? You didn’t learn it from someone else and you didn’t expect it to happen either. You said it just now without even thinking about it. From your mind free from thoughts and prior expectations that `ouch!’ just popped out! This is the true and actual Dharma. “We all have in our deepest mind the most pure, most purified place. We might forget this clear place in our mind! When we see the world around us, in every single moment we must directly encounter it from this place. In our minds, if we fill them with plans and expectations and then harden them into a stuck lump of old experiences and encrusted knowledge, we’ll be trapped into living with having to have everything pass through that place. You must not live that kind of pitiful life! Right now! This mind which is always being born right now—learn to live in this mind always. This is the Dharma.” This is how Muso Daishi taught the elderly couple.\nWe must actually see the flower from this pure, clear place. We must hear the bird’s song from that clear and empty place; the words that we express from that clear and empty place are the words of truth. These are not words that have been carefully calculated and then spoken—words like that are always lies, as are all words that have been designed. Our life’s true substance, our actual truth, is very quiet, has no expectations, and since it has no expectations it is serene. It doesn’t think about this and that; it isn’t confused and deluded, but instead is serene and settled. From this quiet place, that Pure mind which comes forth, this is the actual clear, True Mind which we should know as precious and natural. Living in this mind is what it means to truly live, to be truly alive. This is the Buddha’s Dharma teaching. We must always be in this serene mind. Free from the production of any excuses, we must hold with care that very most pure and Clear mind and know it as what is most valuable. Doing zazen we let go of our ego-attachment and separate from it. We must just once go beyond our ego and become one with the heavens and earth. This very quiet mind must be experienced, and we must taste this flavor thoroughly. The Buddha realized this state of Mind, and his teaching was from his wonder and joy. We carry around so many past experiences with us in our daily lives—all of them are techniques for living. We do need some techniques for living our daily life, but to be alive, to be that life energy itself, requires no technique whatsoever—only a purified and Clear mind. Everything we do is manifested from this Clear mind. This is how the Dharma is taught to us. In his deep realization the Buddha experienced his face before his parents were born. After we are born there is so much externally learnt knowledge, information and conditioning that is stuck onto that mind. Before any of that is added on, we already are endowed with that most Pure mind. In order to express this, the Buddha taught the three varieties of learning of the truth. The first is the person of practice who only hears about the truth; the second who learns about the truth by practicing and understanding the twelve links of causation; and the third who is able to meet a teacher and is guided in his practice. Nevertheless those various teachings are not that Mind itself; they are still the fingers pointing at the moon, tools for our enlightenment. The purer our mind becomes, the less we need these tools—we have to forget about all of them completely, this is how it is taught. Forgetting it all, there is then the most wonderful and pure state of mind. The Buddha was telling us to experience that pure place; to realize and awaken to that place is what he was teaching us.\nDay Six\nSutra 5. Initially, under the bodhi tree you forcefully subjugated Māra, Attaining extinction, like sweet dew, and achieving enlightenment. Without any intention in mind and without experiencing any process, You thoroughly vanquished the heterodox paths.\nA poem praising the Buddha’s superior qualities is given and continued here. The young men are listening. First is taught that there is no one special, no one who is most advanced, no one who is low level in the teachings of the Buddha. If we see this, we clearly see this equality as the absolute law. He explains how everything in existence moves and changes in accordance with the laws of cause and effect. We are not able to make it happen differently. There is nothing absolute except that energy; that is what changes things as they go continually through flux. If good causes are there, then good influences occur. If bad causes are there, then bad influences occur. Nothing escapes this law and this way of things working. This is how the Buddha teaches.\nAnd when he meets the philosophers, they tell him about their way of the teaching of non-thinking. At that time the Buddha taught—and he was not a philosopher himself—that if there was a not thinking of not thinking, who was it that was doing that? The hermits who were philosophers had no answer. He asked them, “Where is this, or is there any ego which is not thinking about not thinking?” The hermits could not answer him.\nIt is fine if there is actually only nothing, nothing at all. But in fact, this world evolves, there is progress, it improves. And that happens because we want to improve and change things. We have motivation and passion to see this happen. So then where is this ego? The hermits could not answer. If there is no ego, then why would there be a need to negate one? If there is an ego, then it divides things into two, and that division cannot be denied, because without dualistic thinking we also won’t be able to improve.\nFor the Buddha this was still a question. He was in the middle of seeing what he had to see. This is about the ego. He most wanted to know about where it came from in the first place, and for this reason he decided to go off by himself and resolve that question with his own experience, challenging those human qualities of having desires, of having greed, of having complaints—to extinguish all of that and align and clarify the problem of their being an ego or not. For this he killed and killed and killed and killed and killed and killed himself.\nSeeing people going off for training, it’s often put, “Go! Die completely!” Or, as Mumon Ekai says, “With every single one of the 360 smallest joints, the 84,000 hair pores, to pour this doubt into our body and being with everything we have; from the top of our heads to the bottoms of our feet, to cut with the sword of that Mu!” To kill everything! In all the twenty-four hours of the day to let go of every last bit of any thought, conditioned idea, education, pattern. And in the doing of that continually, all the time, relentlessly, then we can know this place where there’s no difference between an inside and an outside, this place where there is nothing nihilistic nor is there any having a something. To cut all of that away completely! To do this to the place where we are so thoroughly giving everything to it that we cannot even question! It is like a red hot iron ball that has been in our mouth and we can’t swallow it and we can’t spit it out. Mumon Ekai teaches us in this way. This is the direct approach.\nThis is not about how to calm our mind. This is about a mind which we acknowledge as being like a bunch of wild animals, a gang of thieves, a poisonous serpent. And these three—these desires, this greediness, this complaining—they won’t let us be peaceful. Our whole society has to become clarified in this way. We have to purify all of these various ways of what they call the “mental poisons” so that everyone can realize this Clear mind.\nWhat the hermits were teaching about not thinking was perhaps a part of the process. But our strong desire to live has to be acknowledged and given its work to do. The Buddha gave these instructions—to continue always to kill and kill and kill and to die completely. We have to cut away this small self’s state of mind totally and finally, and then from that place let go of all of our attachments. This is why Shido Munan Zenji said,\nTo die, and die completely! And only then is what we do, good.\nTo kill and kill and kill ourselves totally, until we don’t even know what is alive there any more. People get scared, and they halt and hesitate at this point. How can we live a life if there’s no one there alive to live it?—so wondering how they can be free and do this completely.\nWe have to let go of that ego-attachment. And this is where the teaching of cause and effect comes in. We have to cut that greed. We have to cut that anger. We have to cut that delusion. We have so many self-indulgent thoughts from these three mental poisons that we doubt and suspect each other. We can only come forth from an egoistic place when we’re in that state of mind. When the sun comes out we are not given just one-sixth billionth of a bit of sunshine. We all receive the heat of the whole sun. Everyone has to be able to receive this in the same non-dualistic way.\nSutra 6. With three turnings of the wheel of the Dharma in the chiliocosm, The wheel is fundamentally always pure. As Mumon Ekai has said, we have to continue with our deep clarification until we can let go of everything. In all the twenty-four hours of the day, we continue! We continue until there is no longer any sense of there being an inside or an outside, and our experience is like that of a mute person—of a person who can’t speak, trying to tell their dream. Only they can understand it for themselves. We continue and we develop this until we can know the place where we are deeply aware. And from this experience we come to know, suddenly the earth is trembling and the sky is shaking. At that moment it is as if we are walking hand in hand and seeing eye to eye—seeing with the same eyes as the Buddha and the Patriarchs. We can go into the middle of the city and play in everything we do, in that joyful samadhi. And with this deep experience, the Buddha realized that place of no self and no other, finally and completely. So, from there comes forth the question where is there anything to liberate? Nor are there any longer any desires to be pursued.\nIn society, control is not considered a bad thing. But we have to let go of it all in our training. We have to leave that control behind. If we don’t move through that place, there can be no amazed wonder. And when we can, we can let go of all of it. That leaves only this great law of the heavens and earth. And that is not a concept. A concept is the greatest obstacle. As it says, we have to kill the mother, we have to kill the father, kill the kings; this is the concept of father—which means that we have to kill that one single, attached, mind-moment completely, that darkest ignorance. The mother is the desire for love, that by giving birth we end up loving and longing to be loved. And when we are attached from the core in that way, it becomes an obstruction. This is accompanied by two other ideas to which we have to cut our attachment thoroughly. One of those is the idea that when we die we continue eternally. The other is the idea that when we die there is nothing after that at all. These are both concepts, and concepts obstruct, mentally and dualistically. They have to be let go of. And then our state of mind can shine forth brilliantly.\nOur genetic makeup, our past experiences, and the kind of mind material we find and think about—to not be caught on those things. But to realize this place, where as it says in the Heart Sutra, “without form there can be no emptiness; without emptiness there can be no form.”\nOur senses are not limited. We also cannot paste our memories into an album and think there is some importance in those. Things of the past have to be let go of. We have to let go of those and be instead always in this very precious moment—at this moment which is always clear, always new, always alive and always fresh. Or else we are betraying the truth in each moment. We have to be able to let go of everything in order for the law to work there.\nSutra 6. ... The achievement of enlightenment by gods and humans attests to this, And the Three Jewels are thus manifest in the world.\nWhen the Buddha had his deep experience he could only think that no one else alive could possibly understand what he had just understood except maybe the hermits, and they were already dead by that time. And so it is said in the writings that a god from the heavens came down and implored him to please share what he had just learned, and guide others. In response to this request he went back into deep samadhi and he sat longer. He came out and had realized that the place to go next was to see and teach his very advanced friends, friends of training when he had been at Dantoku-san. They were very glad to see him.\nIt could not be only a matter of him having fallen incidentally into deep meditation. When he came down from that mountain of Dantoku, he was given some milk and some healthy food by Sujata near the Nirzen River, and then he sat at Bodhgaya and finally was able to break through, sitting under the Bodhi tree. But his friends who had been joining him before that in deep ascetic training thought that he had strayed from the Path in doing it this way, and that is why they had separated. But they were still very happy to see him. He taught them first, about the Four Noble Truths—this Path of realizing suffering and that self and gathering were what caused this suffering, that grasping causes this suffering, and that the truth of impermanence and the path to liberation is realized by right understanding.\nWe suffer because we gather. We accumulate, and then we get attached to what we accumulate. We suffer psychologically. And so we have to let go of it all. We practice in order to do that by following the Eightfold Path. To his five friends he gave this teaching, and they were all immediately enlightened.\nAt Kushinagara, under the sala tree when the Buddha was dying, he asked his disciples if they had any doubts or questions. But everyone was so deeply in sorrow that they could hardly speak until finally one said, “Master, no matter what, we will live in accordance with the Eightfold Path when you are gone.” The Buddha told them to be silent, that he would now enter deep nirvana.\nThe Buddha himself: how was it possible that he could really awaken without anyone to tell him how to do that, any person who had gone before him? It was possible because he had realized and exhausted the laws of cause and effect.\nIn becoming we are liable to the laws of great ignorance. And realizing this, we have to be able to break through everything to go beyond it. To be able to see that if we were coming forth in any mind-moment from nothing at all, then we would be coming from a clear place. But if what we were coming forth from in any given mind-moment was a personal karmic darkness, then that is the Great Darkness that has to be clarified and brought to light.\nWe are not yet clear and clarified. A baby appears simple and innocent, yet it is not free from its karmic affiliations. Although it appears clear, it is not a clear place that it has developed; it’s simply not yet affected by others. Like a dog or a cat, it does not consider its own behavior yet. So here is where the Buddha Dharma comes in. We have to clarify and purify with the Mu, for example; we have to be able to cut through everything. We have to be able to take that Mu and, keeping it going all the time, all the time—all the time looking right at what is it that walks? What is it that sleeps? What is it that works?\nIt is not the Mu that says it is in pain and misery—that is the ego. We dig into that Mu and we continue and continue and continue until we lose track of our attached thinking and we realize directly that clear, bright Mind which is then revealed. In zazen—in the Path of zazen—this comes forth from understanding the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Cause and Effect.\nAnd finally, the third turning of the Wheel, the Dharma, is that we are not doing this for our own small, limited self, but we are doing it for the liberation of all beings. And for this we have the teaching of the Way of the Bodhisattva. In order for this to be realized we have to forget everything and give all of our life to others in the way of the Six Paramitas, which are teaching us how to do that with Charity followed by Disciplined Behavior, Great Patience, Strong Efforts, Deep Samadhi, and Clear Wisdom. And in this way the Buddha brought this teaching of the Dharma Wheel three times into society. Right in the middle of that world of desires and differences and prejudice—he realized that even in the middle of all that we are equal and we are One. This is the Wheel of Dharma that was turned three times.\nThree times this Wheel was turned. The Dharma Wheel shows us a way to realize our clear nature, not to bind us to something called “Dharma.” The Buddha taught these ways of training, but this is still only a finger which points at the moon, it is not the truth itself. The moon is the truth. Just as our ego is not something for our own satisfaction, but for liberating all people in society, so the purpose of Dharma is to lead us to the truth, not to be hung onto after that. Dharma is not the truth itself, but a tile with which to knock at the gate. It is the same for susokkan. We repeat it and align our breath by using it until we are clear and stable enough not to do that. It is not to limit and bind us that we have Dharma.\nIf we can see that clearly, then we will have no conflicts. It teaches us but does not bind us. Once we realize it we don’t need it anymore. An example would be like that of raising a young dog. We first have to keep an unruly young dog on a leash so that it doesn’t go into the neighbors’ homes and bother other people. Then when it gets trained and a little older we can take the leash off and it won’t have that same behavior. We can’t stop our training until we can humbly follow through; it is not about getting a school diploma saying “Now you are finished.” This has to be clear. The Dharma is to bring us to freedom, not to bind us.\nDay Seven\nAs the Buddha says, our True nature with its Pure mind sees all things and people as pure. The various paths of those who enter— the path of the Four Noble Truths, the path of experiencing the Twelve Links of Cause and Effect, the path of the bodhisattvas, observing the bodhisattva vows and practicing the Six Paramitas—all of these ways of entering are the Dharma path. But when this path is realized, then there is no more need for carrying around a Dharma. It becomes a leftover caught place which also needs letting go of.\nPeople of the Path are originally healthy. They choose sickness and being treated as part of how they walk their path. They meet a doctor of mind (a teacher), who can see clearly just how things really are and give a prescription for medicine which is eventually healing. But after we take that medicine, we put it into action and we recover, we no longer need the medicine—unless we are addicted to the medicine, which is not a healthy state. This is also like the raft which takes us to the other shore. We leave this shore, which is the side of the river where there is hate and conflict; we use this raft of teaching to get to the other shore which is wisdom. We need this boat, this raft, to get to the other side. But once we are there, having crossed over the water, if we were still carrying the raft on our shoulders while walking around on land, how stupid that would be! To use this Dharma but not become addicted to it and keep carrying it around. As Shotoku Daishi said, “All people, all countries, all teachings have to be clarified”—and then we are pure. It is purity of nature and it is extreme peace, and thereby the Three Jewels were revealed.\nThe Buddha was awakened under the bodhi tree, but this is not some special thing, some extreme experience to realize what is already there—the way of the heavens and earth, that the external world is zero and empty, always in flux, mere phenomena, appearing to exist but only transient with no actual, lasting substance. We have happy times, we have angry times, we have furious times, we have sad times. We change in a second, sometimes! This is our usual world. Inside we are one and the same—this is the way the universe is, this is how it’s constructed. The Buddha was the first one to awaken to this truth and to teach it. If we betray and go against this we just get confused. This law of the heavens and earth and of all humans—it is to this that the Buddha awakened.\nYet we cannot diminish the importance of the Buddha, who realized this and became totally free and then taught. The two hermits he’d learned from before he was awakened were no longer there and so he first went to liberate the five people with whom he had practiced. In that era when the Buddha was awakened, there was a very selfish son of a wealthy man. His name was Yasha. Yasha was continuously seeking only his own pleasures and desires, exhaustively and in any way he wanted to. He went all the way to the end with this, beyond what most people are able to do, and when he had nothing else he found exciting or wanted to try, he became very melancholy. He had used up all of his pleasures and desires so totally that he felt like dying. As he was wandering through the woods of Ikurodaga he ran into the Buddha, who was sitting, meditating in the woods. The Buddha saw Yasha walk by and read his state of mind by his appearance, and he called to him and talked to him. He taught him of the infinite joys and pleasures within and how this was different from those joys and pleasures that were external, those which would end and make us melancholy. Hearing this, Yasha was deeply awakened and he became a disciple of the Buddha.\nYasha’s father, a rich man of the area, was looking desperately for his suicidal son. Walking through the same woods he came upon the Buddha and next to him, his son who was now in robes and with a great bright face. He saw how he had returned from his wish to die and he saw that only this person could possibly have saved his son with his teaching. And he called him—this person who had saved his son—an Awakened One, a Buddha. It was here for the first time that the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha were born. So the Buddha is not someone who is an absolute, but one who has realized the deepest truth—not a golden statue to be worshipped, but that Clear mind which is in each and every person’s heart.\nEveryone wants to be fortunate and so many religions advertise promises of good fortune. Also, to be poor and sick is terrible, and so religious promises are also made around harmonious households, good health, and good fortune. But no matter how happy and healthy we are or what a materially flourishing household we might have, we still have to die. No one can live forever just because they have a lot of money. In our mind if we are shallow in our desires and desperately search for good fortune or money, then we may appear satisfied for awhile, but it will not last. To liberate us from that state of mind of grabbing, to liberate us from that state of mind of defining a line between self and other, we have to realize that place where there is no more division between self and other. If in our mind we are caught, then more and more we can’t live luxuriously. But we can live in a simple way and realize great energy. And with that, to wash our state of mind and live that clarified way knowing just what is sufficient—living moderately, knowing what is enough. Even if we make a lot of money it will eventually disappear. But if we realize this clear state of mind we are always serene. This is the mysterious Dharma in our mind. And if we can realize this place, we can know infinite clarity.\nSutra 7. With this wondrous Dharma you save sentient beings, Who after experiencing it never regress from permanent serenity. As the Great Medicine King who saves us from old age, illness, and death, You should be worshiped as a Dharma sea whose virtues are boundless.\nThe Buddha taught that this world is infinitely in flux, constantly transforming. This huge universe is one Life energy of infinite time, manifesting each moment’s phenomena and making use creatively of each moment’s phenomena. While we are alive we continually get older and will eventually get old and will eventually die. People get old, they get sick, they die. We hear more and more of how many of our friends have died; we get a little scared. The Buddha said our Life energy is in our deepest focus in each moment, in each breath. Our true life is in each breath, each moment— born and dying, born and dying, born and dying, born and dying. To be sick is just one more phenomenon. And our great suffering of having worked long years—this is like a medal, an award we’ve won for getting old. If we casually lived forever and there was no marking, no punctuation such as death, we would never realize the value of being alive. We make efforts in every moment to be able to realize our True nature, and we find out that our truest base is the Dharma sea—the whole universe! In each instant our mind radiates—and from here we know deepest wisdom.\nSutra 8. Immovable before abuse and praise, like [Mount] Sumeru, You are equally compassionate to those who are good or not. Here this poem is continuing the exaltation of the Buddha. The Buddha nature is clarified. We hate to be insulted and criticized, and we love to be praised and honored. We are so light and easy to be moved around. With this true base realized, however, we are not moved around by such things. Knowing our true way of being, we continually work at being full and taut. Like the blowing up of a balloon, each breath—every breath—we put our entire concentration into our tanden. We feel that full tautness within our belly. It comes forth from within, not by forcing with power from outside but naturally coming forth. We are praised but we are not moved around. Or if we are insulted we’re not bothered by it, like a parent whose child insults them and tells them they’re so horrible and the parent says, “Yes, yes, I know”—this kind of huge, all-embracing state of mind!\nThe Buddha was so often insulted, especially by parents whose sons had become his disciples. He was extremely insulted by many, but he was not moved around by it at all. For example, when a man would come in and be very angry at him, the Buddha would answer by saying, “Do you ever have guests come over to your house?” The man would say, “Of course I have guests come over to my house!” And the Buddha continued, “If they come around noontime do you fix them a good meal? Do you give them something to eat?” And the man would say, “Well, of course, if they come at that time I would give them some food.” The Buddha continued, “If you prepare this food, make this feast for them and they come and their stomach is full and they can’t eat and they refuse, they tell you they can’t eat, then whose meal is it? Is it your meal or is it their meal?” The man would say, “Well, of course, it’s, um, my meal.” So the Buddha said, “Well, my stomach is full. So please take your meal and go home with it.” He wasn’t saying it in a way that put the person down or bashed them; he was teaching them something in his equanimous response.\nSutra 8. ... Your mental processes are universally same, like space— Who could hear of the Jewel Among Humans without becoming devoted [to you]?\n“In all the Three Worlds, in all the Three Realms, everywhere is my home. In all the Three Worlds, in all the Three Realms, all the people are my children.” This state of mind of embracing all people has to be taken into consideration. This is not only about the Buddha’s state of mind; our mind also has to be clear, and then there are no more moral or immoral people. All are the same, one and the same. Like a parent who wants very much for their most difficult child to succeed. A child doesn’t usually have a deep sensing of everyone and everything around them, but for adults it is important to see each and every person clearly and as if it was their own child. And even if the child embarrasses them or shames them they still want the child to succeed and do well. This mind of the parent is the mind of the huge, bright blue sky. This is not only for the Buddha but for all of us—not being afraid of another person’s deep, deep problems, fear, and misery, but listening fully with clear openness.\nSutra 9. Now we offer the World-honored One this subtle canopy Within which is manifested to us the trimegachiliocosm, Including the palaces in which the gods and dragons abide, As well as the gandharvas and yakṣas.\n10. We see all that transpires in the world, He of the Ten Powers compassionately manifests these transformations. The congregation has observed this rare event and all exclaimed in praise of the Buddha,\u2028And now we bow our heads to the Honored One of the triple world.\nNow we are much more united—all countries—than we were at the time that this was written. 6.5 billion people and yet we know each others’ countries and exchange communication much more openly. We meet many kinds of people all the time, and yet we have to see that, even though there are many different kinds of people, we are all one and the same. In this way the Buddha showed them all the happenings in the heavens and earth. This was at a time when this could not be done just by pressing a button as we can do today. He showed them the criminals, the murderers, all the different terrible things that were happening. In the time of the Buddha, everyone seeing all this would have been deeply astounded, and to this great Master they all prostrated.\nSutra 11. [You,] the Great Sage and Dharma King, are the refuge of the congregation,\u2028Who purify their minds in contemplating [you,] the Buddha, all of them in ecstasy.\u2028They each see the World-honored One in front of himself, Through the [eighteen] exclusive attributes of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.\nThis great Mind was seen—and not because of some miraculous powers, but from his mind of seeing all people from all countries from all times. As Shinran Shonin has said, “All people in all eras are my father and are my mother.” All people who have been children over the past 3.5 billion years—we have all become parents and children and parents and children over and over again. And so we know we have been the parent and the child for all people. Someone once looked at this mathematically, as it is exponentially increasing by generation. Each person here is welcome to calculate this for yourself, to please see this deep connection, this ongoing, continuing connection.\nSutra 12. The Buddha explains the Dharma with one sound, And sentient beings each attain understanding according to their capacity.\u2028Each one says the World-honored One is speaking his own language, Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.\nIf we go deeply within, we encounter the Buddha. The Buddha in front of us is doing zazen—to encounter that Buddha! To not bother in counting our wispy, unreliable thoughts. Instead, to meet the Buddha. To not continue to entertain those extraneous thoughts. To see deeply within and find what is there when we become totally one with each and every moment right in front of us!\nSutra 13. The Buddha preaches the Dharma with one sound, And sentient beings each understand accordingly. Everyone accepts and practices it, and receives its benefit, Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.\nThe Buddha’s words bring meaning to all who hear it; in each and every word there is deep meaning to be found, each word is alive. It’s like a poem of old:\nIf we clap our hands, all the fish gather, Thinking there’s some kind of food coming.\nIf we clap our hands, all the birds fly away. And if we clap our hands, the tea shop master comes out,\nThinking there is some customer who wants service.\nWith just this one clap of the hands, all of these things begin moving around, alive, and the action happens. It is in this way also that when the Buddha spoke from his clear place it would put many things in action.\nSutra 14. The Buddha preaches the Dharma with one sound, But some are afraid and some joyous. Some generate revulsion [to the world of suffering] or eliminate their doubts, Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.\nFrom the leader’s act of speaking in a single voice, some merely develop an instinct for the teaching, some gain realization, some find pacification of all their doubts—this is a special quality of the Buddha. The Buddha would teach in very simple, direct phrases that would touch each person in a different way. For example, to say, “All is empty,” a greedy person hears this and becomes terribly melancholy, thinking how sad it is that here he wants all these things and that after all they’re empty. One who is unlucky in whatever they do, for whom nothing comes out right no matter how they try it might think, “Well that’s all right! If all is empty after all, it must be just so hard for everyone! There’s no need to be so upset about it!” A very ambitious person would hear these words, “All is empty,” and know that even if he has great prosperity and has gathered great wealth he will have to eventually die and see that all of this is empty. It gives him a chill. He sees that he must help others and do something differently. Each person hears this one simple sentence directly put by the Buddha and feels it in a very different way. This is the very mysterious teaching.\nThe Buddha’s eyes are clear and bright, overflowing with compassion but still clear and transparent. Just as his eyes are clear, his mind is clear as well. After spending many years doing zazen—deepening in the serenity of samadhi—this samadhi is revealed throughout all of his being. This doesn’t happen from the creative and inventive efforts we just put in yesterday or this morning. Over a long period of time these efforts were kept going. The body, the mind, the words that are coming forth—all of them are clear and bright. The teaching of the Buddha is always serene; with great joy he guides us on our Way. This serenity is a very important part of the Buddha’s teaching; today we often see groups of young people gathered, or even religious gatherings as well, and these gatherings are noisy and boisterous. If it is quiet, people won’t gather, they say. Saying this, they try to make things look attractive and colorful, but although perhaps that may be what will make the people satisfied, it is not something that develops the Mind. Because young people have no clear center within, they become insecurely active, needing to always be on the move—active and busy without being settled. By making all kinds of noise they keep themselves fascinated and intoxicated. This has no meaning whatsoever for the deepening and developing of the Mind. It is a mistake to lead the mind into an unsettled state. To harmonize and bring it to a place of peace is what needs to be worked toward.\nSutra 15. We bow our heads to Him of the Ten Powers and Great Exertion. We bow our heads to Him Who Has Achieved Fearlessness. We bow our heads to Him Residing in the Exclusive Attributes. We bow our heads to the Great Guide of All.\n16. We bow our heads to Him Who Can Eradicate the Fetters. We bow our heads to Him Who Has Arrived at the Other Shore.\u2028We bow our heads to Him Who Can Save [Beings in All] the Worlds.\u2028We bow our heads to Him Who Has Eternally Transcended the Realm of Samsara.\n17. You understand the past and future characteristics of sentient beings,\u2028And well have you attained emancipation with regard to the dharmas.\u2028Unattached to the world, like the lotus flower [growing out of the mud],\u2028You always enter well into the practice of empty serenity (i.e., nirvana).\n18. You have attained the characteristics of the dharmas without hindrance,\u2028And we bow our heads to Him Who Relies On Nothing, Like Space.\nThe Buddha teaches what he first heard and then learned through his own experience. His teachings reflect his deep essence and wisdom. Like the lotus, that mind that was in the mud comes forth pure, white—not a bit of stain or dirt on it. Above and beyond this, the Buddha never steps off the Path of his devoted training, freely and fully teaching the truth everywhere and to everyone. We respect this great functioning from our deepest hearts.\nPoem closing teisho\nAutumn at Tahoma-san Sogen-ji—so vast is the clear blue sky! Throughout the days we have sat together, all thought at rest. No self, no other—the Original Face is near! Clearly see: this very body is the Buddha land!\nPoem opening teisho on February 2008\nFrom near and far the bodhisattvas have gathered in the zendo Beginning the training retreat, even the forest extends its welcome. The great silence of Vimalakirti—a diamond sword!\nOur courage unmatched, our hearts firm as iron.\nDay One\nIn the Vimalakirti Sutra, the first chapter is on the Buddha lands. In the city of Vaisali the Kosaka bodhisattva had 500 friends who, with their very fancy parasols decorated with jewels, welcomed the Buddha. Buddha gathered them all—these parasols—and suddenly the whole universe was under one umbrella. The Buddha himself did not perform miracles in this world to clarify our truth. Instead, each person’s Buddha nature—seeing beyond differences, seeing the unified Clear mind in all—for this the parasols were offered.\nAll 500 bodhisattvas present then asked the Buddha to teach them. Their Clear mind had been clarified and was seen to be not dualistic but to be at one with the whole universe—and not through an egoistic view of what “One” is, an idea of an “I” who is at oneness. When there is no separate self which is being centered around, the whole world becomes who we are, and just as it is. This was the first realization that the Buddha was clarifying, and thanks to that we are able to see the Mind as the truth, having seen it was not something separated. This world seems so full of problems and confusion, yet if we let go of our self center as an ego, then we see it all as our own existence. Suffering people, deluded people, are all who I am. So this is why we have to ask, “How can we build a true Buddha land with everyone?”\nSutra 11. When the elder’s son Jewel Accumulation finished speaking this verse, he addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, these five hundred elders’ sons have all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi (complete, perfect enlightenment). We wish to hear of the purity of the countries of the Buddha. Would the World-honored One please explain for the bodhisattvas the practices by which a land is purified?”\nWe are beings who have to eat or we get hungry, sleep or we can’t last. In what way can this dualistic “I” see through these problems, and how can everyone become huge, spacious, round-minded people? This is what we hope for, but when will this ever be possible? We can’t know the answer to that yet.\nWhen our ego is less demanding, then we can be lived through by our deeper wisdom no matter what the situation is. There are people in the world who have to eat meals which cost hundreds of dollars every day; this takes huge economic resources. But if we can be grateful for whatever food there is, no matter what small amount it is, then we don’t have to make so much money to supply ourselves with food. And if we all do whatever we feel like doing—with food, with air, with resources—it will only cause further conflict. Rather, look for how we can all live together with what we have. Because of the conflicts in the world today we have so many vulnerable people who are being hurt. Our worlds are so full of ego and desires that it just keeps increasing, making the conflicts worse and worse. To be one who can share what they have, whatever that is, and share their Path, however far along it they’ve walked—this will help a little. This is what the Buddha is teaching. Here, the young bodhisattvas have asked him to teach them.\nSutra The Buddha said, “Excellent, Jewel Accumulation! You are able to inquire on behalf of the bodhisattvas regarding the practices by which the Tathāgata purified his land. Listen clearly, listen clearly, and consider this well. I will explain it for you.” At this, Jewel Accumulation and the five hundred elders’ sons listened as instructed.\nUpon this request the Buddha gave his approval to the young Latvakara. ‘Good, young man! Your question to the Tathagata about the purification of the Buddha field is indeed good. Therefore, young man, listen well and remember. I will explain to you the purification of the Buddha field of the bodhisattvas. The Buddha then said to the bodhisattvas gathered there, ‘How should the world be, to be peaceful?’\nSutra 12. The Buddha said, “Jewel Accumulation, the categories of sentient beings are the bodhisattvas’ buddha lands. Why is this? Bodhisattvas acquire the buddha lands according to the sentient beings they convert. They acquire the buddha lands according to the sentient beings they discipline. They acquire the buddha lands according to what country sentient beings need to enter into buddha wisdom. They acquire the buddha lands according to what country sentient beings need to generate the roots [for becoming] bodhisattvas.\nThis world of limited food, limited water, limited resources—how do we work with this? Awakened bodhisattvas with their deep wisdom realized will resolve these problems. So, how should we be in the world?\nSutra 13. “Jewel Accumulation, you should understand that sincerity is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva attains buddhahood, it is sentient beings who do not flatter [and lie] that come to be born in his country.\nThe teacher for this question’s answer is in society. This is not about setting up some ideal and trying to make it happen. First we have to look deeply at the society. How should we do this? This is for each person to awaken to, each person awakening to the fact that they are responsible for creating this world.\nHow can each person awaken to that, to create a new, awakened world? We all have to embrace the state of mind of the bodhisattva, to vow to guide others to deep awakening even before we ourselves are completely awakened. Before building material Buddha lands we need deep, radical change within. For example, if we plan to construct a building, first we make the ground very firm and prepare it well, then it is easy to build. If we try to build in thin air, to build in the sky, that is very difficult. In the same way, we cannot force an ideal on people in society. We have to look at the source of the problems first: Why are we suffering? We have to look at that straight on, or else it is like building a building in mid-air.\nSutra “A profound mind is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva attains buddhahood, it is sentient beings who are complete in merit that come to be born in his country.\n“The mind of bodhi (bodhicitta, i.e., the intention to achieve perfect enlightenment) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings of the Mahayana come to be born in his country.\nAt this the Buddha said, “To firm this ground, how do we do that? Not building haphazardly, but building with a firm base.” You have to look at this. “The Clear mind as it is, is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” This is one of the most famous phrases from this sutra of Vimalakirti. “The Clear mind as it is—this is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” So many people do various demonstrations in this world, but how many of those who are demonstrating in different movements also look inside and review their own behavior and make changes within? If your own mind is swirling around in whirlpools of confusion and darkness, that can only make more problems in the world. Yet if there is one truly peaceful person, that person will affect all others that contact them. And this is true, vice versa. If we make an enemy out of everyone who does not agree with us, that will not resolve anything. We have to go first within; we have to review our own behavior and our own way of being inwardly. We become peaceful and that peace will ripple out and touch everyone else. “The Clear mind, as it is, is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” If all of our minds are clear and straight, are not twisted—that is the Pure Land. Because we don’t even know our own minds we are in confusion. We are all born with this Mind that knows beyond conflict. Only if we realize that truth directly can we possibly correct anything. It is not someone who flatters or exaggerates to people; this will not create a true place, it has to be someone who is simple and plain and honest.\nSutra “The mind of bodhi (bodhicitta, i.e., the intention to achieve perfect enlightenment) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings of the Mahayana come to be born in his country.\nAs the Buddha has said, “The Clear mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” So how is this done in this world where there are those who are inhuman? There are those with self-conscious awareness and those without. There are all kinds of plants and minerals, and humans have so readily assumed them all to be for humans’ use and humans’ convenience, as if for humans to live we can do whatever we want to with anything that exists on the planet. And because of this attitude, we do anything we want with all other existences. To see that we have done this, and to see that this is not appropriate behavior—this is the deep, profound Mind. This profound Mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.\nBecause of humans’ desires we have exhausted resources, and we have caused other beings to become extinct on this planet. We use, we dig, we take away. If we realize our profound Mind, then this is not how we act. It is because our profound Mind is not well clarified that this occurs. To be able to see from this profound Mind is to see with the truly seeing eye of satori.\nThe mind of the bodhisattva—this Pure Land of the Bodhisattva, this deep Mind of the bodhisattva-mahasattva, makes the vow to offer one’s whole life to liberating those in society. Just to bring forth this state of mind of wanting to make that vow, not even yet realizing it—that is the deep Mind which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. When we give rise to this vow, even if not yet realizing it, then people with the same vow from all over the place will come and gather.\nSutra “Charity (dāna) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—all sentient beings capable of renunciation come to be born in his country.\nThe mind of charity is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. This is the first of the Six Paramitas—of charity, of following the precepts, of patience, of making great efforts, of meditation, of wisdom. Even if we have nothing material to offer as charity we can still offer kind words, a generous heart, smiling eyes—things we don’t need money for or material things to offer, but which touch deeply. There are so many volunteers and people in the helping field in this world, but when they are still involved in their own benefit or profit or how much they’re getting appreciated or approved of, that is not true giving. That is not true charity. To have that interaction where all three parts of it are empty—where the person who is giving is not known, where the person who is being given to is not known, and where what is being given is not known. We cannot be caught on any results of this. We see that everything that we do is transient, but nevertheless, we work so hard, not even aware that we’re working, with no sense of having done anything. Truly clear and fresh no matter what we’re doing, this brings great joy; doing it with joy comes naturally. This functioning is also the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. People who can be joyful at throwing themselves away completely will then gather.\nSutra “Morality (śīla, lit., “maintaining the precepts”) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have fulfilled their vows to practice the path of the ten types of good come to be born in his country.\nLiving the Precepts is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. If offering something externally, materially or not materially, as in the first of the Paramitas, charity—this is to offer our inner alignment. We live the precepts. To be able to go within and align, and when we are aligned within, we can live fearlessly. Only when we can live fearlessly can we take away others’ fears. We get up early, we eat meals in an aligned way, we live according to rules—living by rules that are an aligned lifestyle— we learn to naturally live in a harmonious way. And then if we can become that life in a kind of second-nature way we can learn to become free from the unskillful behavior of our body, our mouth and our mind. The unskillful behaviors of our body are that we can be violent, that we can kill, and that we steal. The unskillful behaviors of our speech are that we flatter, that we are hypocritical, that we lie, and that we say different things to different people or say things that aren’t really being felt in our heart. The unskillful behaviors of our mind are that we are greedy, that we indulge in anger, and that we are ignorant. If we can realize the precepts and live in a way that we are harmoniously aligned, then people who have wide open and expansive, round minds will gather wherever we are.\nIn this way the Buddha taught how in that clarified Mind we find the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. He continues teaching what that clarified Mind is—that clarified Mind which is the Mind which brings forth the Vow of the Bodhisattva, that clarified Mind which offers everything, that clarified Mind which lives in the way of the Precepts. One after another he teaches this essence in great detail.\nWe cannot stay egoistic or the world stays confused. But if we align within, then everything around us comes into alignment. If we don’t live this, then it will stay conceptual. And if we stay conceptual, then no true Buddha land can be constructed.\nDay Two\nFor the construction of the Buddha lands—the world which is truly peaceful—the Buddha teaches the most important points for constructing this. Each person has to first, be direct in mind. Realizing that clarity and purity of Original mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. Then people have to also realize the deep, profound Mind—that Mind that sees all things as Buddha nature. People have to have the conception of the spirit of enlightenment; this is the Bodhisattva Mind. There’s the Direct mind, the Profound Mind, and the Bodhisattva Mind, and these three—all of these are the mind of zero, that Mind which is purified and clarified and free from any taint of ego. As Rinzai Zenji has put it, “The clean, pure light in a single moment of our mind.” This is not a Buddha which is far away, some place in the sky, but that very Mind within each of us with which everyone has been born. The Direct mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. The deep, Profound Mind—when we are living in that mind all day long, seeing the stars blinking and the moon radiantly shining, the whole universe is holding up everything! There is nothing without purpose and value, and everything is connected in Oneness. This whole universe is the Buddha land as it is—a world beyond any kind of discrimination or ego-attachment. This is the deep, Profound Mind which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattvas. And the Mind of the Bodhisattva sees this world so full of suffering people and gives everything to awaken all beings to that Way of the Bodhisattva. These are the three that are most important.\nFor living in the way of the Direct mind and the Profound Mind and the Mind of the Bodhisattva, it cannot be done by merely being conceptual. And so we have the Six Paramitas, which give us the actual details of how to live in these three states of mind. The Six Paramitas are, first, the way of charity— to live our daily life in offering everything, material and non material, to the people who are suffering in society, to guide all beings to liberation. The second Paramita is following the precepts—to align ourselves within. The first Paramita is to offer everything externally to all people in society, to all beings; the second is to offer our own alignment, to going within and being clear and purified within. The third is that of tolerance, or patience. The fourth is that of great efforts or hard work, the fifth, of deep samadhi, and the sixth, of profound wisdom.\nSutra “Forbearance (kṣānti) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have ornamented themselves with the thirty-two marks [of a buddha] come to be born in his country.\nThis matter of tolerance is the most difficult—to be tolerant, to be patient. In Japan the word for “patience” is written with the character for “mind” over which is written the character for “sword.” This facet of patience is very difficult-to-realize. In the sutras it says that no matter what ascetic practice or difficult challenges we go through, there is nothing as valuable or difficult as patience or tolerance. When we do zazen our body hurts, our thoughts are chaotic, confused and demanding. People so often ask, Why do we have to endure this? The sword over the mind!\nThe person who is be not moved around in any situation, receiving everything as it is, is written about in the sutras. No matter what in the world appears, to have no mental notions occurring about it. The best example of that is a baby—a baby who is fearless, accepts everything exactly as it is, without conditions. If everyone became like this then all conflicts would instantly end.\nPeople will say, how can we live that way, though—so weak and unprotected? But look at when we die. Can we really stop it and say, “Wait! I’m really not quite ready to go yet”? No matter what power, weapons or money we may have, we can’t stop death from coming. We all have to die; we can only unconditionally accept it. This is the ultimate point of religion—its deepest substance.\nBut even if we can’t become it and know this kind of tolerance and patience to this depth, we can at least not get furious at every little thing. To review our behavior and repent, look into how we can change it—to apologize—to endure, to tolerate, because none of us is perfect, either. We are not perfected beings. We are all, also, ignorant beings, so we have to be able to be humble, to ask for others’ forgiveness. Some people say that life is a factory for building a face. Some say that Tolstoy had many masterpieces in what he wrote, but that his greatest masterpiece was his face. Overcoming challenge after challenge, one who is no longer moved around by anything—not getting red OR blue in the face when some small problem comes along, the mind not being moved around at all—this is tolerance.\nThere are many practices for that in the sutras. If one realizes this mind, as it is said here, “When he attains enlightenment, living beings with the transcendences of tolerance, discipline and the superior trance, hence beautiful with the 32 auspicious signs, will be born in his Buddha-field.” The 32 auspicious signs—this is the description of the Buddha and how his quality was. That great roundness and dependability—this is what is most important. And then people of that sort will gather. This is what the Buddha has taught.\nSutra “Exertion (vīrya) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have energetically cultivated all the [types of] merit come to be born in his country.\nIn the Yuikyo Sutra [The Bequeathed Teachings Sutra]—the sutra that was given last by the Buddha before he died. In the sutra he taught meticulously about the way of practice, like a mother chewing food for her baby—he teaches that people of training should train in a way which is talked about as looking at a single raindrop. The power of a single raindrop seems so insignificant; and yet, if we have the raindrops to bring down from the eaves, and in the same place a raindrop falls down on a rock, over and over again for years, eventually that raindrop will carve a groove in the rock that it falls upon. This is true in many cases. When we continue over a long period of time then even with what seems like the least significant efforts, there is a remarkable possibility fulfilled. This is what is meant by virtuous application. There are things that can’t be accomplished without this kind of application of energy. We may live for 80 or more years in our lifetime, but there are some things that may not be completed during that time.\nBut how many millions of years have humans lived here on this planet? One person’s life is so brief, but that whole flow is our Life energy. It is not about a single outcome being quickly accomplished. Buddhism with its expansive vocabulary is very nonchalant about expressing the hugeness of this way of looking at things. When it comes to discovering the kalpa, for example, the explanation in Buddhism of what a kalpa is, is this: It is as if we had a boulder that is 50 cubic meters in size—there is this boulder, this huge boulder. Once every 500 years a heavenly being comes down; she is wearing a koromo which is made out of feathers, and her feather koromo has sleeves that are diaphanous, like the wings of a cicada. They are so fine, so transparent. And as she comes down to dance around this boulder once every 500 years, the tips of her sleeves touch this boulder. A kalpa is the amount of time it takes to wear away that boulder with those tips of the diaphanous sleeves of that feathered koromo touching it once every 500 years. Buddhism casually uses vocabulary like this.\nWe may think, Where is this all going to end? When is this going to end? But if one has done the koan of the root source of Mu or the true, everyday state of mind of Mu, we know this One Mind which is beyond any kind of obstruction, beyond space and beyond time.\nWith our whole body and being we dive into giving everything we can to it in the hugest, sharpest way, giving everything we have. And if we can do this, then we can see how this works. And if we cannot, then our clarity of Buddha nature becomes very far away and vague.\nSutra “Meditation (dhyāna) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who control their minds and keep them undisturbed come to be born in his country.\nThis is the fifth of the Six Paramitas. Hakuin Zenji says in his Song of Zazen, “As for the Mahayana practice of zazen, there are no words to praise it fully. The Six Paramitas, such as giving, maintaining the Precepts and various other good deeds like invoking the Buddha’s name, repentance and spiritual training all finally return to the practice of zazen.” The Sixth Patriarch has also said it—that the greatest of all our entrances is that of samadhi—to give no additional ideas of good or bad to anything that we perceive externally and within, to not stay stuck on anything that we are looking at. If we allow our mind to become disorderly we cannot accomplish anything.\nIn doing high quality work we have to clear out everything to focus. Only then are our best capabilities manifested. For people playing sports, they focus and they forget their body completely. Or for a musician playing the piano, she forgets her hands, even when she’s playing—these are examples of that kind of samadhi. But if our zazen is done only when we are in the zendo and then as soon as we go to do something else we forget all about it, we will consistently be divided between two worlds—that which is the world of sitting and that which is the world of not sitting. In the four postures of the day, whether we’re walking or standing or sitting or lying down, all of these have many possible mind states. We have to become able to not entertain any extraneous thoughts or to entertain our own personal view no matter what we’re doing—whether or not we are on the cushion.\nThere are also many who think zazen is some kind of intoxication. But this is not the case. It is accepting all, accepting everything we see, everything that comes, and not stopping and not getting our mind caught on any of those things that come along but to be always moving along, not getting stagnant, staying with the flow. This is not about being fuzzy, intoxicated, and unfocused, but to be sharply at one with each thing that we encounter and then let it go to become the next thing. This is why Hakuin Zenji has said, “The Six Paramitas, such as giving, maintaining the Precepts and various other good deeds like invoking the Buddha’s name, repentance and spiritual training all finally return to the practice of zazen.”\nWhen we are making offerings, that which is doing the giving is empty, that which is receiving the offering is empty, and that which is being given is also empty. This is the same when we are chanting the Buddha’s name. In every one of these cases, to do it in such a way that we forget ourselves completely and there is no extraneous clutter that is obstructing our purity and flow of mind.\nSutra “Wisdom (prajñā) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have achieved] correct concentration come to be born in his country.\nThis is not superficial wisdom or knowledge, but that wisdom which comes forth from being in deep samadhi. Like a mirror, samadhi and wisdom are the same. What comes to a mirror, a mirror reflects, whether it’s a person or a high mountain. A mirror can reflect because it is empty, like the state of mind of samadhi. If we hold onto any self or self-reflection, then we mar the clear reflecting of the mirror. Because a mirror is empty of anything it can reflect perfectly whatever comes in front of it. Because a mirror has none of its own face it can reflect whatever comes, perfectly. But if we cannot be clear and reflect perfectly, that is because we are stuck on our own personal ways of seeing, thinking this world is wrong, for example. This is a source always of great mistrust—we think the problem is that the world is mistaken and that’s why we can’t trust anything. But this just increases conflict. If we don’t see clearly, then we misunderstand everything. Without aligning this misunderstanding we can become a source of conflict. What I think is good in the world, this person thinks is bad and inconvenient. What he thinks is good in the world, I think is bad and inconvenient. As long as this kind of thinking is going up and down and all over the place then is no true peace possible.\nThere is only Direct mind, which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. In the Engako Sutra [The Sutra of Perfect Awakening] it’s written that wisdom reflects perfectly what comes from every single direction. And only samadhi can do this. For realizing this we have zazen.\nBut even if we sit in the form of zazen, if we don’t let go of everything and realize samadhi—throwing away everything, everything that we have piled up—that doesn’t cut it. It is not about being clever and saying smart-sounding answers, but about being huge and accepting of everything that comes along. This is why it is said in the Lotus Sutra that it is of great value to be in a quiet place and develop that state of mind which is not moved around by all kinds of things—and then we can know that Clear mind that is tall, firm, stable and sturdy, like Mt. Sumeru. Then we can know how, if we are in this place of wisdom:\nSutra “Wisdom (prajñā) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have achieved] correct concentration come to be born in his country.\nIf we collect this state of mind and we know this place where we are clear, then we will not get caught on whatever comes along. We are always burning up the energy in our mind, like a light bulb burning in broad daylight, because we’re thinking so many things when we could just be letting them go and be empty of all of that distraction. The point is to not hold on to anything in our mind whatsoever. This is the true state of mind of zazen.\nWhen we sit on the cushion, though, we have to sit in such a way that we are being surged through by a full tautness that spills into the whole universe, and from there become not moved around by anything at all. Our eyes, our ears—all of our perceptions become transparent. We are able to extend throughout all of the ten directions this state of mind which is coming from this deep samadhi, which is wisdom. People who value true wisdom will gather around those who have realized this state.\nIn this way the Buddha tells about the Buddha land and how to create a world of true peace. Today people are all doing whatever they can for one system or some bit of material progress, but peace is making no headway. Here it is pointing out how a great, radical revolution has to occur within each person’s mind, and not look for some kind of a huge change in something outside of us. We have to have this radical change within. And for the doing of that we have this teaching about this Direct mind, this Profound Mind, this Mind of the Bodhisattva, the ways of the Paramitas—of having great charity and offering everything, of following the precepts, of knowing this way of tolerance and patience, that hard work of meditation and samadhi, and of that deepest wisdom—and further ways of doing this that are yet to be brought up. Today we have looked at these three deep Minds and the Six Paramitas. To bring this truly radical revolution in each person’s mind into possibility! If we wait for others to do it or for something to happen that makes it work, we will never see it happen. We have to be able to do this from within, and it is doing this and how to do it which the Buddha is teaching here.\nDay Three\nSutra “The four unlimited states of mind (i.e., the brāhma-vihāras, the four immeasurables) are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have developed sympathy, compassion, joy, and equanimity come to be born in his pure land.\nThe Buddha has first taught of the three great Minds—the Direct mind, the Profound Mind, and the Bodhisattva Mind—and the way to give life to these Minds. He has taught of the Six Paramitas. Next are the Four Immeasurables. A bodhisattva is one who is not moved around by anything in any situation—in every situation they function infinitely with the Four Immeasurables, with this immense Mind of the Dharma living through them.\nThe first of those are the two components of the word “compassionate,” which is made up of two parts, two characters. One is the character for “to give love” and the second character is “to take away”—take away pain, take away insecurity. It’s like the sun—the sun which has both light and warmth. These cannot be separated; they come simultaneously. When the sunlight comes out, the location of everything becomes clear. When it is dark nothing can be seen and distinguished. But with light everyone can again function, knowing where everything is. In this way the sun lights the world and brings warmth to the world. This warmth is wisdom. As the sun rises higher and higher in the sky, then the hard ice melts, and as the ice melts then the living things can come back to vigorous life. The warmth, the light—these cannot be separated.\nThe bodhisattva gives this wisdom to all people, and with this wisdom takes away their fear. With this light, with this warmth, people are brought joy. And with that joy the bodhisattva also is joyful. Like a parent with a sick child, when the child gets better, the parent is also joyful. For this the bodhisattva throws away everything, material and otherwise, and dives into society with this infinite functioning which extends everywhere—not just for one or two certain people but for everyone. That mind of throwing away everything—this is the Way of the Buddha.\nSutra “The four means of attraction are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have been attracted through his emancipation come to be born in his country.\nNext we are told how to bring this Mind to all people, how to bring them to realize their True Mind. First of the four ways is the practice of charity—the same as was mentioned in the first of the Six Paramitas. Then there is that way of using and expressing in words kindness and clarity. And the third way is to be able to be on the same level with everyone else—what they are doing, to join in in the same way. And then there is the way of supporting people in material ways, such as offering tea and candy when meeting; even if the central issue is that of Mind, to support that with material things will be of benefit. Charity is to offer wisdom, to offer material things (which we read about in the Six Paramitas). But this offering, the person who is making the offering and the person who is receiving the offering, must all be empty. There is no sense of the one who is giving, no sense of the one who is receiving, no sense of something being given.\nBut even if we offer wisdom, it cannot be done in the way of saying, “You must understand it like this.” Rather, we have to see what a person really needs and then, when we know what they need most, to offer it in the way that it can be received.\nSecond is to speak with kind words that a person can hear easily. This is the high quality of a culture’s expression. We always have to polish and polish and polish the way we use words. In the koans, we have the first type of koan which embraces the whole universe—the greatest wisdom of the whole universe. The second type concerns how that wisdom then functions in various situations. And the third type is on the subtle use of words—how we can use words in a way that truly expresses what we have realized and can function in that way. This is the Patriarchs’ infinite wisdom that becomes second nature. People have to be joyful when hearing these words, when receiving these words, and then these words then bring hope and encouragement.\nNext, to bring benefit to people. For example, when people gather together for practise, then offer some food and drink, some refreshment. Of course, people are gathering to deepen in Mind, but at the same time, for the harmony of the group, to bring this simple benefit. In kanji the character for “harmony” is the one for “food” and next to it is the kanji for “mouth.” When people gather, then serve tea and candy even though the topic of the event is not related to that—to make sure that everyone is benefiting in coming to this gathering.\nFinally, to do these things right alongside everyone else—that we are equal. With everyone who is practicing, we join with them in the same place, in the same way, in the same clothing, joining in in a way that brings everyone into equality.\nSutra “Skillful means are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings whose skillful means are without hindrance regarding all the the dharmas come to be born in his country.\nNext comes skill in liberative techniques. We cannot use these without wisdom or we’ll be used by them. To know what is right and necessary for each person, to be able to see what it is that each person needs—not to be indiscriminately going about saying how we think things should be for people but to be able to see clearly what each person needs. We cannot be looking at these things as moral or ethical techniques, or else we might start thinking that everything that is being done is some kind of liberative technique. For a volunteer who works so hard to care for someone, it could also be considered a liberative technique, but we have to see what is for which reason. We get confused about what is a liberative technique and what is the Original nature. We have to know and clearly understand what these liberative techniques are; without a deeply clear and awakened Mind the techniques will become confused. We’ve been given those Four Noble Truths—how human beings are in a world of suffering from having a view of themselves as a small self; and that view leads to greater suffering because we’re always gathering things, having things, and accumulating mor things. This suffering is relieved by realizing the truth of impermanence; seeing that these things will not last helps us loosen our grasp on them. And finally, the way to realize this truth is the Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.\nSutra “The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhisattva’s pure land— when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have accomplished the] foundations of mindfulness, correct exertions, numinous capabilities, faculties, powers, and the noble path come to be born in his country.\nNext we have the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment: the four foci of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of magical powers, the five spiritual faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the eight branches of the holy Path. These are many ways to rely on the Clear mind. They are not moralistic and ethical ways to go about judging people, nor are they moralistic tools. When we are praised and honored, we humbly pass it along, holding back on no possible opportunity to liberate all beings and to give everything—to offer our life for doing this. We also have the need to clarify those three unskillful behaviors of body, the four of mouth, and the three of mind. These are all ways to bring people to complete realization—aids and methods for this deep cultivation.\nSutra “The attitude of rededication [of merit] is the bodhisattva’s pure land— when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, he attains a country that is complete in all [forms of] merit.\nSince Hojaku and the other bodhisattvas had asked the Buddha to teach them how to awaken and also how to bring liberative techniques to others, he had answered with these previous lines. And now he continues, teaching that the base of all is to have a Pure mind, an honest mind, a straightforward mind. In any era there are people who, hearing such things, discourage and manipulate us, saying, “Nothing like that really works. You know nothing ever really changes.” They are full of mental ideas that are lacquered on, conditioned, fixed. But no one is born with these fixed ideas. We have to encounter everything and every person with this round, Clear mind to which we have been awakened and bring that same awakening to 6.7 billion people. It is a very rare occasion and hard to come by that we can receive this great opportunity of having a birth as a human being. It has taken 3.5 billion years, this Life energy with which we can live, with which we can realize awakening. To not waste it! To not waste the wisdom of having lived it in this way, or to waste the Path friends with whom we have been blessed, or this air, this water, this precious environment that we have received. To be able to share it, even if it appears to be a loss to ourselves. Not to be caught on anything like loss and gain. Everything—everything has to be seen as equally given to everyone.\nNeither can we live without the aid and the support of vegetables, of animals, of all kinds of beings. We are protected by all of these beings. To see this profoundly, deeply and directly, and to see how it has been this way through all eras. To realize the wisdom which has been gathered there and align our minds to it, and with that to work in society.\nSutra “Explaining how to eliminate the eight difficult realms [where the Buddha and Dharma are unknown] is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, his country is without the three evil destinations and eight difficult realms. The various problems of society have to be seen in this context. Nothing is a single person’s fault. But to align each person’s state of mind so that we can live, each of us, from our own innate wisdom is what’s needed. Without wasting anything, to see all of society as one huge Life, so we can all align ourselves with that functioning which we realize when we are in touch with our true wisdom. And with that wisdom we align society. Everyone—to not run around so busily! Sit down quietly together. We cannot just give charitable material gifts and volunteer work—but to align people’s minds joyfully, together. This is most important of all, and everyone knows this. Then when people become quiet, that very clear place where they are doing that—that inner space also becomes a quiet place, a supportive location. When each person realizes their own wisdom, then no noisy instructions are needed. People can hear what they need to know from their own innate wisdom.\nIn this way the Buddha taught that all is in order, and he finally said,\nSutra “Maintaining one’s own practice of the precepts without reviling the deficiencies of others is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, his country is without the names (i.e., without even the words) ‘violation’ and ‘prohibition.’\nIn each person’s clear, Direct mind—there is the place of enlightenment. If we know that, and that our Mind is pure, we don’t have to strengthen our many thoughts. We become settled and we can make clear, bright, Buddha lands.\nSutra “The ten goods are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings whose lifespans are not interrupted, who are very wealthy, who are chaste, whose words are truthful, who always use gentle language, who do not isolate themselves from their subordinates and who are good at resolving disputes, whose words are always beneficial, who are not jealous, who are not prone to anger, and who have correct views— [all these types of sentient beings] come to be born in his country.\nIn the day’s news we only hear of terrible things—things involving great crimes, and great conflict, hardly ever anything good. As the Buddha had taught 2,500 years ago, “We are what we think, having become what we thought. Like the wheels that follow behind the cart, when we have evil thoughts we have evil results. We are what we think, having become what we thought. Like the shadow that follows behind one, when we have joyful thoughts we are followed by joyful things.” We now see how this has truly become the case. We have to seriously receive this as how it is around us and take responsibility for this world which is so cluttered. For us to clarify this is the responsibility of each of us.\nSutra 14. “Thus, Jewel Accumulation, according to his sincerity does the bodhisattva generate his practice. According to his generation of practice does he attain the profound mind. According to his profound mind does he discipline his intention. According to the disciplining of his intention does he practice in conformity with the teaching. According to his practice in conformance to the teaching is he able to rededicate [merit].\n“According to his rededication does he have skillful means. According to his skillful means does he make sentient beings accomplish [liberation]. According to his accomplishment [of the liberation] of sentient beings is his buddha land pure. According to the purity of the buddha land is his explanation of the Dharma pure. According to the purity of his explanation of the Dharma is his wisdom pure. According to the purity of his wisdom is his mind pure. According to the purity of his mind are all his merits pure. “Therefore, Jewel Accumulation, if a bodhisattva wishes to attain a pure land he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind is his buddha land pure!”\nWe are given this precious chance to do zazen together, but it cannot be only zazen of automatic form or it will only increase our various thoughts ongoingly. As Hakuin Zenji has said, “In this place of our lower abdomen, in the place of the fire in our lower body and in our feet and legs, to bring to that place all of our energy. Our true home is to be found there. In this place of our lower abdomen, of our lower area, of the bottoms of our feet—to bring to that place the building of that world of Amida. In this place where we bring all of our energy together in this hot furnace of our tanden, of our legs, of the bottoms of our feet—in this place, to find this true Dharma body,” This place where there is nothing needs no decorating whatsoever. This cannot be done in a murky way. It has to come from our deepest vow and determination to clarify and purify all things. When we can do this we can bring these Buddha lands into being. If our zazen is truly done deeply and with integrity, then we can actually bring revitalization and new energy to everything.\nDay Four\nSutra 15. At that time Śāriputra was influenced by the Buddha’s numinous charisma to have this thought: “If the bodhisattva’s buddha land is pure according to the purity of the bodhisattva’s mind, then when our World-honored One was a bodhisattva his mind must have been pure. Nevertheless, this buddha land is so impure!”\nWe come now to the final part of this section on the Buddha land construction, teaching how to bring peace and lasting harmony. For this each person has to have a peaceful mind. All people have equal rights even according to the law, yet crimes do not stop. The more laws we make, the more laws are broken by those who look for ways to find loopholes in the newly made laws. Laws cannot resolve people’s fears, people’s insecurities, their pain, their miseries, nor their inner suffering. Rather, it is these painful states of mind that drive people to break the law, to commit crimes, to do violent acts, and desperate behaviors. Those who have money and status and are in charge—people think taking that away will change something. A newborn baby doesn’t think like that. The Buddha saw this and knew clearly that it isn’t laws that will solve the inner dis-ease. Only each person seeing clearly their own mind—this actuality— will solve that.\nOnly if we have purity of mind is this possible. But when we read a newspaper what do we read? We read about bribery, thievery, various crimes, murders—not very pure at all. Shariputra, the top disciple of wisdom, could turn circles around any person, even if they had many doctorate degrees. ‘When the Buddha has such a Pure mind, then why is the Buddha land around him so impure? When the Buddha has appeared in the world, how could it be like this? In this way Shariputra was doubting.\nSutra The Buddha knew what he was thinking and asked him, “What do you think? Although the blind do not see them, can the sun and moon be anything but pure?”\n[Śāriputra] answered, “No, World-honored One! This is the fault of the blind, not that of the sun and moon.”\n[The Buddha said], “Śāriputra, it is through the transgressions of sentient beings that they do not see the purity of the Tathāgata’s (i.e., my) buddha land. This is not the Tathāgata’s fault! Śāriputra, this land of mine is pure, but you do not see it.”\n“Shariputra, in the same way that a blind person cannot see that light, a person who does not have a Pure mind cannot see a Pure mind because they are not yet awakened.” If we are full of grumbling and complaining we cannot see with the eyes of gratitude and wonder. We have to be able to be pure to see these things. If the mind is full of complaints and suspicions, no matter how beautiful the place you find yourself in, no joy and no gratitude will spring up. If you do not open your mind’s eye, if that mind’s eye is impure and you look at the world through it, the world also looks impure. If we look at the world from a mind that is cluttered, the world looks cluttered. This is natural. If our mind is clear and bright, the world around us becomes a clear and bright place.\nNear Okayama there is an island where people with Hansen’s Disease [leprosy] used to be isolated. Now there is a bridge, and today people can freely come and go. Earlier it was considered to be an extremely contagious disease; people were sent there by the country, by the national law. As you probably know, the reason is, this sickness is externally visible. Patients’ lips disappear, their eyelids fall off and the ends of their noses crumble. The disease was considered extremely easy to spread around, too. The medicine we have today—bromine—was not yet known about at that time, and people who were discovered to have the disease in Japan were forced against their own wishes to go to this island, sent like criminals thrown into a prison. People who suddenly arrived there would almost always consider suicide; they had to be watched very carefully when they first arrived—like a prisoner being thrown into a solitary prison cell. And for one year, two years, three years, they wouldn’t even be able to see what kind of a place they had come to, where they had been living. When Roshi first went there, there were 1200 people still living there. Now there are only 300 people, almost all elderly people, because the disease is no longer considered to be so dangerous and people aren’t isolated when it’s known they have it. But the people who are there have extreme physical deformities because of having Hansen’s Disease and they do not want to leave and live in the world. They are being allowed to live there for the rest of their lives. In the early days they needed twice as many doctors and nurses to take care of the people there. Young nurses—nurses in their late teens—were told by their parents not to go, their parents were so against the idea. “Please don’t go to that island; you will never be able to find a husband if they knew you were going there.” They would not be able to find a partner, or they might even get the same disease. But these young nurses, just starting their careers came of their own will and took care of the patients on the island. Doctors who could have had great jobs in the city also came—because they wanted to do this for the people on this island, to take care of them, to wipe the puss, to take away the pain, to change their bandages. These patients, who were always so angry and resentful, saw these doctors and nurses who were healthy. What were they doing there? How could they have come just to take care of them? That they would be there, they were like bodhisattvas! And because the patients saw that these people had gone there to take care of them when they had felt so resentful at a society had thrown them aside and would give them no regard—yet here were these people so kindly and so openly taking care of them—they had to let go of their own resentment, their own anger.\nIn this way, the people who were there felt finally that all people had not looked away from them. The doctors and nurses had come to take care of them; even though it was in many cases such a challenging situation for them, they had willingly come. Even though people in society had pushed the patients aside, these people had come to take care of them. Feeling this, they would be finally, for the first time, able to look up and look around at what a beautiful place this island was. There were dandelions blooming in that sand dune. Over there were cherry blossoms in bud. In another place the violets were coming out. They would write poems.\nUsually their families would not even write to them because they didn’t want anyone to know that in their family there was someone with such a disease. They wanted no letters coming from that asylum so that no one would know where one of their family members was living.\nIf the mind is clear, the country is clear. If each Pure mind is free from the eye of dualism and prejudice, it will reflect everything—like a clear mirror. The world just as it is, is reflected exactly. If we hold on to prejudice and dualism in our mind, the world will also be seen as full of prejudice and dualism; we will be able to receive and accept some things but not be able to receive and accept others. To let go of our own attachments is that very construction of the awakened world. When we are in our settled mind, we see purely; the flowers, the radish, the carrot—these are all the brilliant light of the Buddha. The awakened world is truly not some external heaven or paradise but is that very awakening to our huge, expansive and all-inclusive mind with which we have been endowed since the beginning. Sutra 16. At that time Conch Crest Brahmā King said to Śāriputra, “Do not think thus, saying that this buddha land is not pure. Why? I have witnessed the purity of Śākyamuni’s buddha land. It is like the heavenly palace of Īśvara.”\nBrahma Sikkin was a heavenly god whose hair was shaped like a spiraling cone or conch, and he said, “Shariputra, you say it is an impure world, but I see it as a heavenly abode. You just can’t see it because of your state of mind. The gods all see it as a beautiful place but you see it sullied because that is your mind that is seeing it that way.”\nSutra Śāriputra said, “As I observe this land, it is hills and hollows, brambles and gravel, and rocks and mountains—all filled with defilements.”\nShariputra says, “What use is that, when the world is full of weeds and thorns, threatening cliffs all over the place, garbage and empty cans lining the highways, when the mountains—all of the mountains everywhere—are all a big mess wherever you look?”\nBrahma Sikkin replied to Shariputra in this way, “The fact that you see such a Buddha-field as this, as if it were so impure, Reverend Shariputra, is a sure sign that there are highs and lows in your mind, and that your positive thought in regard to the Buddha gnosis is not pure, either. “Reverend Shariputra, those whose minds are impartial toward all living beings and whose positive thoughts toward the Buddha gnosis are pure, see this Buddha-field as perfectly pure. In your mind there is prejudice and dualism; that is why you see it that way.”\nIf you see it with the Buddha wisdom you wouldn’t see it dualistically. There are both equality and discrimination in the world; we have to see them both. There are criminals, there are people with no food. If we lose track of that then we lose our wisdom. It is a world of dualism; we have to see this. But it is not only this. We have to know what to see with this deeply seeing Eye. People who are weaker, people who are in pain—we want to relieve their pain. We give people food who have none. We comfort those in a crisis. We have to see this directly and clearly. But if we are not careful we will think that the work of helping someone is a wonderful thing. This can easily be deceiving, thinking that a person is their sickness, is their misfortune, is their difficult situation, is their homelessness—and not see their True nature which is equal in each person.\nTheir shape and form does appear in a different way, but we can’t get caught on only that appearance. There are many appearances, shapes and forms; this is important. We can’t smoosh them all together with some big bulldozer, getting rid of all the differences. We also can’t miss being able to see the clear nature which is in everything, or we’ll see them as weaker people and miss the whole point of their liberation. They all have exactly the same eye of satori, but this has to be opened. The true, original character is the same. Sickness and misfortune is not the Original nature; these are all only appearances. But the True nature is unchanged.\nIn the Soto Sect a teacher named Kitano-san would go to the jail, to the prison, and he would line up the people who were incarcerated there and he would say to them—he would apologize to them and then would deeply bow and gassho and say, “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry. We are all the same in this way, and yet here you are, having to live here and take this punishment in this place. I’m so very sorry.” He saw them all as the same, no difference. We think we understand this, but it cannot be seen through a mind’s eye which is rational and mental. If our mind is pure, then the Buddha land we seek is pure.\nSutra Conch Crest Brahmā King said, “Sir, your mind has (i.e., perceives) high and low because you are not relying on buddha wisdom. Hence you perceive this land as impure. Śāriputra, the bodhisattva is universally same [in attitude] regarding all sentient beings. The purity of his profound mind relies on buddha wisdom and therefore is able to perceive the purity of this buddha land.”\n17. At this the Buddha pointed to the earth with his toe, and instantly the trimegachiliocosm was as if ornamented with a hundred thousand jewels. It was like the Jewel Ornamentation land, with all its immeasurable merits, of Jewel Ornament Buddha.\nThe entire great assembly exclaimed at this unprecedented event, and they all saw themselves sitting on many-jeweled lotus flowers.\n18. The Buddha told Śāriputra, “You should now observe the purity of this buddha land.”\nŚāriputra said, “So it is, World-honored One. Originally I did not see it; originally I did not hear it. Now the purity of the Buddha’s country is entirely apparent.”\nThe Buddha said to Śāriputra, “My buddha country is always pure, like this. It is only so as to save inferior persons here that I manifest it as a defiled and impure land. It is like the many-jeweled eating utensils used in common by the gods, the food in which is of different colors depending on their merits. Just so, Śāriputra, if a person’s mind is pure he sees the merits and ornaments of this land.”\nNext the Buddha says this to Shariputra, “You have to see this well: if this world becomes too easy, people will take it for granted. And if it becomes too pure and clear, then it is also true.” In the olden days there were no such fancy toys for children, who maybe had one stick or one milk bottle. They could play for hours with these simple toys. But when children are given fancy toys, they stop reading, they stop making things up, they stop being creative. They have no more need to be creative.\nAlso, we have to thank the ones who first dug the well from which we now drink. This way of seeing—that there are some simple ways of doing and being—has come from a long, long past. We have to see that we aren’t just doing a job—that if we want to do a job and don’t have the exact perfectly fitting tool, we have to be creative and invent something. We lose our own ability to be creative because we forget the value of working hard. Look at this world! So many are suffering. It is incomplete. This is a very important school for all of our learning.\nIf our mind is quiet, we can see clearly. We don’t need food from a fancy restaurant. We could have fancy, beautiful food from a restaurant, perhaps, but there is the even bigger joy of looking at food we have made ourselves or that someone has cooked for us from their deepest heart. Or sewing something by hand and wearing clothes that are hand-crafted. They may not look as fashionable or fancy, but the warmth and the creativity in them is from our own heart. It has to connect with our deepest heart. To be busy all the time and lose track of this connection to the things we are around and things we do is very sad.\nBuddha continued with Shariputra, “What is important is to take responsibility for this life we have been lived through by, to make daily efforts which make this life, and share it with all people. This is true purity.” To realize this and see this! Sutra 19. When the Buddha manifested the purity of this country, the five hundred elders’ sons led by Jewel Accumulation all achieved forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas. Eighty-four thousand people all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.\n20. The Buddha then withdrew his numinous powers, and the world returned to its former [appearance].\nThe thirty-two thousand gods and humans who sought the śrāvaka vehicle understood that conditioned dharmas were all entirely impermanent and, distantly transcending sensory defilement, they attained purity of the Dharma eye.\nEight thousand bhikṣus [achieved] nonexperiencing of the dharmas, their minds liberated by the elimination of the flaws.\nHearing this, all of the bodhisattvas clarified their state of mind and understood this Life energy that was so joyful, that was being manifested at that time. Eighty-four thousand people—all the citizens and people from all around—are all equally endowed. They all saw how this world changes constantly and how our state of mind also changes. Each returns to that place, living with that clarified Eye. To be able to see this, we need to see this humbly. The Buddha’s 8000 disciples also lost their greed. They became a bright Mind that can be grateful for everything. And with this, the section on the construction of the Buddha lands is completed.\nWe can see clearly from what is written here how if our mind is pure then what we see is pure. This is a great reminder of what is necessary to bring this world to true peace. To be in this huge and open state of mind and with that, to work in the world. To never regret any amount of work it takes for the liberation of all beings.\n","id":52,"length":30563,"title":"Chapter 1: The Purification of Buddha Lands","type":"essay","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/chapter1/"},{"content":"This is a starter theme for Quire, a multiformat digital publishing framework.

He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means.\n“Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”  Teisho Even though the Buddha had requested it of them, none the disciples felt that they were able to call on Vimalakirti, having been reprimanded and cautioned by him in previous encounters. They had all been exhorted by VImalakirti to improve their training and felt they were not good enough to meet him again. So now the Buddha asks Manjusri Bodhisattva to go.\nBecause it was a momentous event, a large entourage of eight thousand disciples, five hundred bodhisattvas, and a hundred thousand gods and goddesses all came with Manjusri to see Vimalakirti.\nSutra  At that time the Elder Vimalakirti thought, “Now Mañjusri and a great congregation is coming.”\nThen with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.\n  Mañjusri entered the house, and he saw the room was empty, with Vimalakirti lying alone on a single couch.\n   Teisho Manjusri went with many disciples and heavenly beings to visit Vimalakirti. In his house, in his small room, there was not one single thing, only Vimalakirti resting alone. There was incense burning and he was waiting for the guests. This is the \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; tearoom. No matter what wonderful tea utensils there are, they are put away and only a single flower is offered to the Buddha. Incense is also offered and nothing else is in the room. This is the rule for the host, to create a room where no random thoughts can enter. It is the clear mind of the host that prepares this room.\n\u0026ldquo;The Tea room within - Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce we enter the tearoom there are only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers to be seen, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose and we taste the delicious tea. With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, clarity and serenity are realized. The room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure and so was his heart and his mind, with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri Bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.\n  ","id":54,"length":540,"title":"Chapter 5: Mañjusri Visits Vimalakirti offering Condolences","type":"essay","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/chapter5/"},{"content":"Teisho From today we will read together the sixth chapter of the Vimalakirti Sutra, “The Inconceivable.” Vimalakirti, it was written, has been visited by many—32,000 bodhisattvas and 8000 great disciples all were in the room where Vimalakirti rested. This room was approximately two meters by two meters in size, yet into this tiny room where everything had been removed except one bed where Vimalakirti was resting, all of those people entered. The great tea master Rikyu, who held Vimalakirti especially important, purposely used this same size - room for the smallest gathering of people to drink tea together. Today in Japan this same size room is still used for the serving of tea. Large tea gatherings can be for hundreds, but a small tea ceremony is always for only three or four people, each invited specifically because their mind would meet well with the others and they could communicate. This is the way of the small tea room tea ceremony. Nothing luxurious is used, always making use of what is already there, and being creative with everything. That which is used and served is the entertainment and the subject of conversation during the tea ceremony, and while drinking tea to also learn the wisdom of the Buddha.  Two meters by two meters, this small room where Vimalakirti was is also called a ‘hojo,’ the basic unit of size for a room for simple, harmonious communication. But how would all those disciples and bodhisattvas possibly fit into that room of two meters by two meters? Good and bad, many and few, success or failure–using these dualistic ways of looking at things, these kinds of ideas and discriminative ways of thinking, they could not possibly fit into a room two meters by two meters. But if that room of two meters by two meters is known as the whole universe, then all of them can fit easily.  And so we might ask, why not just say from the start that this single room was like the whole universe? This is where Zen does not allow dualistic thought. This room is the manifestation of each person’s mind, and if it is a mind which is clear and unobstructed, then it is the size of the universe. If it is a mind full of dualism and discrimination, then this room is very small. Two to three millimeters is the size of our retina, and yet into our eyes what huge things enter! We can perceive enormous things with those very tiny retinas. How is this possible? To live in a huge state of mind, more huge than one can usually fathom! This room of Vimalakirti was not mystifying for him. Four thousand people, even 100,000 people or any number of people could go in if they just went in one at a time. To be creative in this way is our wisdom. This is the teaching of the chapter on The Inconceivable.  Sariputra Sonja, who was one of the Buddha’s great disciples, had the greatest wisdom. He was called Sharishiva and he is read about in the Heart Sutra where he appears twice–his name meaning he is the son of a woman who is like a white bird (shari). His mother had been very, very wise, and her brother was also wise; he was a scholar who was named Choumo Shi Sonja. “A scholar who has very long fingernails” was the name of her brother because, when he learned about the nephew to be born to his sister and the great wisdom this nephew was bound to have, being born as the son of such a great wise mother, he was so excited that he even forgot to cut his fingernails. Sariputra was this nephew and a great disciple of the Buddha.  The Vimalakirti Sutra is a great advertisement for the Mahayana, along with some other sutras which are particularly for that, and Sariputra Sonja plays the role of the bad guy in this sutra occasionally. For example, here he notices there are no chairs for all the bodhisattvas and others to sit down on when they come to visit Vimalakirti, and he mentions that they need chairs for all the visitors who come into the room. To which Vimalakirti says, “Sariputra, did you come with Manjusri to visit me or to find a chair? Didn’t you come because Manjusri and I are going to be discussing the Dharma, and now you want a chair, too?”  Sutra  At this point Śāriputra saw that there were no seats in the room. He thought, “Where will this congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?” The Elder Vimalakīrti knew what he was thinking and said to Śāriputra, “Which is it, sir—did you come for the Dharma or come seeking a seat?”   Teisho No! No! replies Sariputra. I have came for your great wisdom. I’m not waiting here for a chair.  Sutra Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, those who seek the Dharma should begrudge neither body nor life. How much more so a seat!   “To seek the Dharma is not a seeking in the context of form, sensation, concept, processes, and consciousness, nor a seeking in the context of the realms (dhātus) and entrances (āyatanas).  “[To seek the Dharma] is not a seeking in the context of [the three realms of] desire, form, and formlessness.  “O Śāriputra, in seeking the Dharma one should not be attached to the Buddha in seeking, nor be attached to the Dharma in seeking, nor be attached to the congregation [of the Sangha] in seeking. In seeking the Dharma, one should seek without recognizing suffering, one should seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering], one should seek without contriving the complete realization and cultivation of the path. Why? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If one says ‘I will recognize suffering, cut off the accumulation [of suffering], and realize the extinction [of suffering] and cultivate the path,’ this would be a contrived theory and not to seek the Dharma.   Teisho Vimalakirti says then what Dharma is. It actually is wisdom, and this wisdom is innate. Not to be confused with learned knowledge, but to be wise and creative from that inborn wisdom! Today we have infinite information and knowledge–from the internet, for example–but we have to use it creatively and wisely, to make use of this wisdom with which we are all endowed. The Dharma is not something to be sought for externally. That source of all knowledge is wisdom and Dharma. All Dharma is the universe; it is the universe which uses that knowledge. If there is no Dharma we cannot make use of our knowledge, so especially for liberating others it is very important.  Teisho Vimalakirti says, “Sariputra! This is Dharma! This is our body! Or else it is nothing but a lump of flesh. You come and are saying that you want to have a chair. Well, this body is not to be what uses the Dharma; the body is used by the Dharma. Just to come and rest our body is not the point of it.” In this way he further reprimands Sariputra.  To clarify the Dharma we have to look at our perceptions–our hearing of the bird, our seeing of the flower. “What kind of bird is that?” “It’s a red flower!” This questioning brings forth motivation to act, and we want to put the flower in our room. We put the flower in our room and use our senses further in the doing of that. Because we have a body we also have many desires. We want to see something, we want to hear something, we like one thing, we dislike another. Our ego has preferences. We feel insecure, we get confused in our mind; sometimes we also feel good and aligned. But all of these come forth from our five sense aggregates. Even if we feel it as something externally caused or something happening to us, there is actually nothing causing it. It’s only a function of a phenomenon coming from the activity of these aggregates. And in seeing this clearly and actually realizing this is what’s happening, we can see the emptiness of our own suffering that has only ever come forth from these transient aggregates; what influences us strongly here is our habits and our preferences. Our zazen and our wisdom enables us to clarify this. To see directly and clearly that our body is empty, our motivation is empty, our ego is empty, and our feelings are empty! Our body is a collection of billions of transient cells. We are not always seeing that red flower, and we only move to pick it because there was a motivation which arose from the seeing of it. Our ego was never there in the first place when we were born, but formed later around the age of three when we began to perceive dualistically. None of these have any fixed, substantial, actuality and so they are only phenomena and not Dharma, and there is nothing there to be pulled around by. Our perceptions and the movement that comes forth from them are always changing, and because we are engaged in these things that are always changing, that cannot be said to be Dharma. Dharma is that which does not change.  Making it even more complex, we have these six perceptions: our eyes see, our ears hear things, our nose smells things, our mouth tastes things, there is feeling on our skin of hot and cold, we hold things, and we also have a wide, huge awareness, even of this whole earth, using various combinations of our senses. But even if we see a flower, if we had had no previous experience we wouldn’t know that that which we are seeing is a flower or that that flower that we are seeing is red. Also, our eyes and ears are not dependable, but always changing. So these as well are not part of what the Dharma is because they are always changing.  We see and hear and smell, but it is the source of all of that that is the Dharma. It is not about what is doing or what is being perceived, but that which gives life to the perception and that which is manifested by it. The river is not the Dharma, the mountain is not the Dharma, the flower is not the Dharma, the other manifestations are not the Dharma, but that which is doing the manifesting is the Dharma. If we were to put it in a different way, it is not about mentally understanding, it is about what is prior to that mental understanding. Forgetting our small self completely, to return to the place prior to where there is any notion of a small self, where there is no self to be understood–to perceive it from that place, it is then called the Dharma.  People in the olden days always wanted to put it so intimately. In the way that Kobo Daishi said it as well, the Dharma is that which is doing the seeing, the hearing, the smelling. But meanwhile there is no noticing of that seeing, hearing and smelling being done, like a fire that can’t burn itself, like an eye which can’t see itself. They function but they cannot self-reflect. In this way, to function with no self-reflection, this is the Dharma.  Vimalakirti further says this is a world of many strata. These three strata are the realm of desire, the realm of form, and the realm of formlessness. For some people it seems like a world based on desires for this and for that–things to see, things to hear. Others will see it as a material world, a world based only on that which is material; they are unable to believe in things that are invisible or that cannot to be perceived by the senses. The world of the formless is the world of the artist, the musician, the writer–the world of mind, of creativity and perception. We all see these strata, these three realms, in different ways, and we all see our lives in terms of these three different strata. If we are stuck on one particular stratum, if we depend on something–something which is material, something which is of one of those strata–then that is not the Dharma. The Dharma is that which is doing the seeking of the desire, the seeking of the form, the seeking of the formless. We live in a way that is a combination of these various strata, but if we depend on any of them, that is not the Dharma. Only if we can forget ourselves completely, then we can open up to becoming that Dharma completely.  Sutra “To seek the Dharma is not a seeking in the context of form, sensation, concept, processes, and consciousness, nor a seeking in the context of the realms (dhātus) and entrances (āyatanas).  “[To seek the Dharma] is not a seeking in the context of [the three realms of] desire, form, and formlessness.  Teisho Again Vimalakirti teaches: A Buddha statue is not the Dharma. Neither are the words written in the sutras the Dharma. No matter what excellent features on a Buddha statue, that is only meant as a representation of the splendid character of the Buddha, not some statue to be worshipping. Many people will say that all these people training here (at Tahoma Monastery), they’ve been training for so long and they’re still all so messed up. But of course! That is why we continue training, because we’re all so incomplete; we’re not totally empty-minded all the time. When we express the state of mind of Dharma it is most splendid.  Obaku and Shukusho Kotei Rinzai Zenji’s teacher, Master Obaku, was always doing prostrations. One time when Master Obaku was doing prostrations in the place where he had been learning from Enkan Kokushi he was visited by the emperor-to-be, Shukusho Kotei, and the emperor-to-be said to him, knowing that he was very fond of the words of Vimalakirti, “Vimalakirti says that we should not be relying on anything, not even on a Buddha, a Dharma, or a Sangha. So why do you do prostrations all the time if it’s not prostrating to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha?” Immediately Obaku slapped him. And Shukusho Kotei got very angry and said to him, “You are way too rough! Only to become empty-minded completely, this is the best way to realize this place.” And Obaku then answered him, “Where in that empty-mindedness is there any such thing as rough or not rough?”  When great athletes are playing their sports in the best possible way, they are not thinking about their feet and their body and their hands. There’s a poem about playing an oriental stringed instrument called the shamisen that goes,  The shamisen—Play it with your heart. Do not play it with your hands. Don’t play it with your hands, But become that quiet mind.  Great athletes, great artists–none of them are concerned with what part of their body is doing their art and sport. Rather, to live in accordance with the Dharma and become totally empty-minded; in this way it all becomes expressed of itself.  Our zazen as well is not about thinking about how good or bad our zazen is. By the third day here we have forgotten the external world and can just melt completely empty-mindedly into the sitting, the drinking, the meals, the walking. We have an idea that we are sitting well or that we are not, and immediately the ego slips in. To joyfully dive in and become one with each activity, with each moment: that is the Dharma. Not to be criticizing ourselves and separating from it, but to realize that we are being given life, we are being lived through by this Dharma. To not be training and always be criticizing ourselves, but to find that by continuing this ongoing training, even the inclination to do that melts away. In this way our training enables us to see how the Dharma is truth.  When Vimalakirti teaches, we hear his deepest wisdom being expressed, and without even knowing it we learn from listening. This is his superior skillfulness.  Sutra “O Śāriputra, in seeking the Dharma one should not be attached to the Buddha in seeking, nor be attached to the Dharma in seeking, nor be attached to the congregation [of the Sangha] in seeking. In seeking the Dharma, one should seek without recognizing suffering, one should seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering], one should seek without contriving the complete realization and cultivation of the path. Why? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If one says ‘I will recognize suffering, cut off the accumulation [of suffering], and realize the extinction [of suffering] and cultivate the path,’ this would be a contrived theory and not to seek the Dharma.   Teisho This is taken from the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path which were constantly being taught by the Buddha, teaching that suffering comes from grasping and then feeling sad when we lose the things we grasp for, and that the cessation of suffering occurs by practicing the eightfold path. But the verbalization of even these essential teachings is not the true Dharma. If we even think we have practiced or are practicing or have practiced a lot, that is no longer the Dharma. Yet neither does that mean that we should not seek and not practice. Rather, we should seek and practice but do it so thoroughly and so completely that we don’t even notice we’re doing it anymore.  As Master Dogen has said, we all have the potential within, but without awakening that potential, we can’t manifest it. The Buddha’s most direct Path of Cessation of Suffering—if we are attached even to that Path, that is not the Dharma. The reason the verbalized Eightfold Path is not the point is because it often ends with words only–emptily spoken words while we are in actuality still attached. To say, ‘I understand the Path and have stopped grasping’–that is formulation and verbalization. Rather, to actually do it to where we don’t even notice we are doing it.  Vimalakirti puts it this way, though frequently people couldn’t really get it when told to practice even beyond knowing they’re practicing, to seek to where there is nothing more to seek, without even knowing one is seeking. But this is the truth of the Path.  Neither are the Precepts words, but they are a way of living from within. As the Buddha taught, Take refuge in nothing which is external. Take refuge only in the Dharma. Do not take refuge in other people; take refuge only within. As the Buddha said at the end of his life, he had never spoken a single word of Dharma. As it is also said, All things are transient, nothing is eternal. This is the way things actually work. We get very caught on some ideas or something we think is absolute, but there is nothing that is fixed; everything is transient. If we get caught on anything, we are immediately mistaken. But if we are free from any grasping, our mind is naturally and spontaneously calm and peaceful. Originally there is not one single thing. With this state of mind we live every day and then everything becomes realizing the Dharma. We see that things manifest and disappear, and we don’t get caught on any of that. We perceive ourselves as deluded, but to not hold on to even that. That is not seeking. The transiency of all of it has to be recognized. But if we hold even that as something absolute, that goes against it.  So these are the road signs to the Path up the mountain, but it has to be walked, actually walked, continuously, not just referred to verbally. And when we finally reach the top of that mountain we forget those road signs, those hard switchbacks, the valleys below. It is not about walking this mountain forever. It is about getting to the mountain’s top, realizing that liberation. But while seeking we cannot get caught on its verbalization and stopped there.  Sutra “O Śāriputra, the Dharma is named extinction, it is calm and peaceful: if one practices generation and extinction this is to seek generation and extinction, not to seek the Dharma.”  Teisho Sariputra had come to Vimalakirti’s room where there were many thousands of beings and asked for a chair. “Reverend Sariputra, did you come here for the sake of the Dharma or did you come here for the sake of a chair?” The Dharma is about forgetting your body completely. There is the story of the disciple of the Buddha–one of his relatives–named Ananda. He had a severe carbuncle on his back. There was a doctor named Giba who was always close by the Buddha and taking care of him, who said that he would operate on the carbuncle on Ananda’s back. To cut it would hurt very much, and there were no such things as anesthetics in those days. But Ananda said that he would listen to the Buddha’s teaching during the operation and then he would feel no pain because he would forget his body completely as he listened to the Buddha’s teaching. And that is what he did, losing track of his body completely while being operated on.  At first we notice our body so much in zazen. But eventually we even forget we have a body. We lose track of every kind of thought. We become only clear and we become a state of mind which is equanimous. This is how it works when we are not holding on to any idea about it.  Nangaku Ejo Zenji trained with the Sixth Patriarch. When he first came to visit the Sixth Patriarch, the Sixth Patriarch asked him where he was from. This question cannot be answered casually; it’s not going to be satisfied with a name, a place, or simply calling oneself a monk. To truly answer this question it took Nangaku Ejo eight years–eight years until he could say that only what can’t be spoken of had arrived there. Nangaku Ejo Zenji was already an excellent, high-level scholar, and yet it took him eight years to realize this state of mind and to actualize it. Asked who he was, and the Sixth Patriarch not accepting anything he would come in with: not a man, not a woman, not rich, not poor, not enlightened, not ignorant–he dug into it deeply. But no matter what words or ideas he brought in, they were not accepted. He sat and sat and realized an immovable state of mind. The Sixth Patriarch was not just listening to his words when he came in, he was seeing that state of mind.  This answer of Nangaku Ejo’s is the same for all of the Buddhas, it is the same for Shakyamuni, the same for all of the awakened ones. No one was talking about how they had realized some great state of mind. ”Now, don’t soil it!” This is true of everyone, whether they realize it or not. In earlier history, Zen teaching would often be expressed by drawing a circle. These circles were drawn to express that state of mind which is beyond dualism, where there is no such thing as dividing it into good and evil. No need to use words. And one who had realized this experience would easily understand why it was a circle that was drawn.  Sutra “The Dharma is named the undefiled: if the dharmas, up to and including nirvana, are defiled, then this is defiled attachment and not to seek the Dharma.  Teisho The Dharma is to let go of everything, even letting go of our own idea that we are practicing. To not even be thinking that we are doing something called “practice,” like an athlete who isn’t thinking that she’s making a great play or a musician who isn’t thinking that he’s making great music. In our daily life when we are doing our very best, our deepest and most effective work, we have forgotten our body and our thoughts completely.  Sutra “The Dharma is without any locus of its practice: if one practices in the Dharma, this is a locus of practice and not to seek the Dharma.  “The Dharma is without grasping and forsaking: if one grasps and forsakes the Dharma, then this is grasping and forsaking and not to seek the Dharma.  Teisho In the world, people are not always holding onto what they are doing or thinking about whether they look good or not. For example, we have someone as great as Mother Theresa, helping the poor, helping people who have Hanson’s Disease (formerly called leprosy) and other great challenging problems. And yet she certainly was not thinking all the time about what a good job she was doing. We have to throw away everything we are doing. Only in doing that is it truly the Dharma.  Sutra “The Dharma is without locus, it is not a secure refuge: if one is attached to locus, this is to be attached to locus and not to seek the Dharma.   Teisho The Dharma is not only about something which happens in a zendo but is in every single part of our life, in our everyday life. We are making it into something special when it is about not being moved around by anything.  Sutra “The Dharma is named ‘without characteristics’: if one’s understanding accords with characteristics, this is to seek characteristics and not to seek the Dharma.  Teisho As Hakuin Zenji has said in the Song of Zazen, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be any place else. Realizing the thought of no-thought as thought, whether singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.” To be in this truth in each moment, no matter where we are. No matter what we are doing, we do it because it is necessary: waking, sleeping, coming, going, but never moving a single step. Things come right to us, we don’t move toward or away from them at all. It’s not about thinking, “I did this,” “I finished that.” Just as Hakuin is telling us here, it is not such a dualistic view.  Sutra “One cannot abide in the Dharma: if one abides in the Dharma, this is to abide in the Dharma and not to seek the Dharma.  Teisho In the Diamond Sutra it is written, “Abiding nowhere, Awakened Mind arises–that which is not moved around by anything, just wherever we are, doing the tasting, the seeing–just wherever we are doing whatever we are doing without being stagnant in anything we do or anything we say.  We know this place which is talked of in days of old as a place where the river flows, and even if there are great rocks and huge tree trunks it continues just flowing right by them, going forward, not stopped, not with an idea that something has to be like this or has to be like that. That is only playing around with dualism and is not the Dharma.  Sutra “One cannot see, hear, sense, or know the Dharma: if one practices seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, this is seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing and not to seek the Dharma.  Teisho We are living along with the Dharma, but while we live with it we don’t know it because there is no discrimination. And when there is no discrimination, that is the Dharma. The Dharma is for all people to live in any and every situation but it is different in accordance with whether we have realized that or not. At each place at each time we can get easily confused, but it isn’t about whether we were praised or insulted. We are not moved around by any of that. Each moment’s life energy is our Dharma. Even dualism is Dharma, too. We are not caught on that either, or resistant, saying, “No, no, it must be like this!” In each moment, just being in accordance with each and every situation completely, not dealing with such differentiations as color and form or being young or old, man or woman, rich or poor; realizing each situation and moment clearly but not being caught by anything in it. Because we get caught, the world gets complex. We get stuck. We think of suicide. But this is because we don’t understand. There are always going to be ways out. To experience this we have the Sixth Patriarch’s definition of zazen: “To let go of every idea of good and bad that we are always attaching to all of our perceptions of things external, and at the same time, to drop all of our concerns within.” To not be caught on what we see, hear and feel all over the place; we have to let all of it go–once–to the place where we can see how huge we really are. This is the word “maha” of the Maha Prajna Paramita Sutra– the Heart Sutra–that hugeness as huge as the great sky, endless and boundless. We are that huge. We are completely free. We are able to be like a flower or a bird. And while this is the Dharma, if we think that about it, it becomes dualistic.  The thoughts which we have to have because we need to do things–they’re not so many; they’re relatively few compared to the huge number of thoughts that come up as soon as we sit. We’re astonished by how many thoughts are suddenly buzzing around in our head as if we had struck a bee’s nest; there are that many thoughts coming into our head. It’s also kind of like methane gas, a methane gas puddle in our brain with all of these fermenting thoughts. And we’re kind of addicted to this methane gas in our brain. We get addicted to this methane gas and we want to stay caught on our thoughts. We have to send fresh air into this by holding on to nothing at all–not just thinking that we should be holding onto nothing at all, but actually holding onto nothing at all, and this is not so easy. The thoughts keep pouring in and pouring in and pouring in.  If it is something of form that we are trying to move out of our way, an object or material thing, we can just push it over there, move it away. But in our mind it is so hard to push away a persistent thought which keeps coming back. For this we have to use wisdom. Wisdom is something like a mother in a store with her child who has decided that he is definitely going to have his mother buy a certain thing, even if he has to scream and shout until she finally gives up and does it. But for this screaming child, a wise mother will simply, quickly, turn his attention to something completely different. And suddenly the child will have totally forgotten that he was upset, and what he was upset about. Suddenly the crying stops while the new external interest is discovered. The Dharma is not about being caught. But we have to be able to liberate ourselves or we cannot liberate others.  We put things in our mouth and saliva comes forth; we swallow and our stomach conveniently divides things into fluid and solids, and sends what the liver, lungs and heart need, to them. These are all done without our even helping. Our organs all work on their own without even being given orders from the brain. Even if we don’t chew well and eat too many oily things, our body still moves things through. In the same way, if we think too much then we go against the natural way. But even this is still the Dharma.  Sutra The Dharma is named the unconditioned: if one practices [within] the conditioned, this is to seek the conditioned and not to seek the Dharma. “Therefore, Śāriputra, if one seeks the Dharma one should be without seeking regarding all the dharmas.   Teisho So, Sariputra, if you are interested in anything, you block Dharma’s natural way of being. But to be empty-minded is not so easy. It’s very difficult. When we are three we get interested in having our own personal position and we defend ourselves by attacking others. If we are always living in dualism it is so hard for us to return to empty-mindedness. But we have these inescapable gates which will remind us and teach us how. Those are the gates of birth, sickness, old age, and death. We always think this death is something so far off, but we never, never know. To always be ready! There is not a way that we can do this. We’re always trying to choose the best thing, but that will not do this, either. People are always trying to take what they want most, what is of the most benefit, but this won’t do it. We come into this world naturally, with only one thing, and that is our Unborn Mind. As it says in the Heart Sutra, our true clear Mind is like a mirror; it simply reflects everything that comes to it. Those things that are reflected in a mirror have no substance, and even if it reflects dirty things, a mirror does not get dirty. But whatever comes to it is simply reflected from this Unborn Mind–the mirror-like Mind. And everything that comes is accepted, and everything is then let go of. As Daruma Daishi has said, to let go of every single external connection we have, completely, and then to give up every concern within. He taught our refuge clearly. To not push things that we’re trying to have happen, with insistence: we’re always trying to fight and push to get what we want, and this is where the problem arises. We have to take refuge in the Dharma and its cultivation.  In China there is a teaching of having no intention, no rank and no meaning. In China it is also said that for ruling people wisely it has to be done evenly. And for this, the idea of merit is important. They teach, for example, that we receive rain and sun and natural blessings as merit that we all have equally, seeing as we are all given these together. Also, for the global problems today this is important. What will come, will come. To become huge, to see this clearly, and to see how today people are in such a big hurry when what we need to do is to wait and be patient for things because the natural course will come forth. We instead try to make it all happen so fast and try to make things get going so fast, and so we crush what might happen. Everything is already right just as it needs to be. To trust in that and to see things from our most huge state of mind.  Sutra When he spoke these words, five hundred gods attained purity of the Dharma eye with regard to the dharmas.  Teisho This chapter “Inconceivable Liberation” is truly telling us of the inconceivable. We generally live in a dualistic mental world and cannot stretch easily to a world of the inconceivable. That actuality of the inconceivable becomes hard to believe.  Vimalakirti leaves that common sense world behind to teach us the truth. We are born and live for a lifetime, and get through life and its pains and sufferings shut down in a framework of life and death. We learn to think from early on that we are this person and we judge things accordingly, seeing only through our limited awareness and experience. We live in our sullied world wanting to break through it and be liberated from that narrowness. For this, God and Buddha and Infinity and a Life Forever have been invented, imagining a heaven, a paradise which opposes a dirty world, making these imagined things, making an absolute that we believe–this is how it is. This is our great foolishness, making us even more melancholy today.  Today we have this idea of liberating; we see this idea but we can’t easily pick up what we have once discarded in a world that has thrown away god. So what moves this world? What is its engine? For our ancestors who believed in a god it was their conscious ideal. But caught on the small-minded concept of who we are, and because we could not mentally grasp something so huge, we could not make the leap. This is why Vimalakirti is working with us like this.  Sariputra carelessly said what had popped into his mind, that all these bodhisattvas were there to hear the Dharma and wouldn’t they get tired without even a single chair. Vimalakirti answered, had he come there for the Dharma or for a chair? For the Dharma we have to give up everything–our body, all of it. As Daruma Daishi said to Niso Eka Daishi who had come to ask him to teach him the Dharma, “With a small-minded, ambitious, conceited mind like yours, one cannot perceive the Dharma.” People today are all stuck on an idea of their small, limited, self-centered identity, and we don’t want to give that up. This is what Daruma Daishi was saying to Niso Eka Daishi. And because in those words, like these of Vimalakirti, things seem like bragging, people have a hard time believing them. And because we are so entrenched in our mentally attached framework, we can’t even begin to imagine our true source, which is what is being shown here.  Sutra At this time the Elder Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī, “Sir, in your wanderings throughout the immeasurable ten million koṭis of incalculable numbers of [buddha] countries, which buddha land has lion seats made with the best and most wondrous qualities?”   Teisho Since Sariputra had spoken earlier about the chairs, Vimalakirti brings this up, addressing Manjusri–the same Manjusri who is honored in the middle of the zendo, being, as he is, the manifestation of wisdom who can see everything in everyone as perfectly equal. Piercing through the past, the present and the future, Manjusri can move freely through these worlds which are immeasurably distant. In the cosmology of India there is one sun, one moon; around the sun the planets move, including our Milky Way, and there are one thousand of those. One thousand of those is one small realm. There is one buddha in each small realm, teaching the truth. And one thousand small realms make a medium realm, and one thousand of these medium realms make a great big realm. If we gather three thousand great big realms, that is the size of our universe–beyond imagination. And it is countless, immeasurable years–this we cannot even figure out with the computer. Vimalakirti says to Manjusri, “Didn’t you see a fine chair over there in that far-off world some place?”  Mañjuśrī said, “Retired scholar, in the east, as many countries away as there are grains of sand in thirty-six Ganges Rivers, there is a world-system called Characteristic of Sumeru. Its buddha is called Sumeru Lamp King, who is manifest [in that world] at present. That buddha’s body is eighty-four thousand yojanas tall. His lion seat is eighty-four thousand yojanas high and paramount in ornamentation.”  Sutra At this the Elder Vimalakīrti manifested the power of numinous penetration, and immediately that Buddha dispatched thirty-two thousand lion seats, tall, wide, and pure in ornamentation, which arrived in Vimalakīrti’s room. This was something the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indras, Brahmās, and four heavenly kings had never seen before.   The breadth of the room entirely accommodated the thirty-two thousand lion seats with no obstruction. Nor was there any deformation of the city of Vaiśālī, Jambudvīpa, or all the worlds of four continents. All appeared just as before.  Teisho At that moment Vimalakirti, having focused himself in concentration, performed a miraculous feat such that the Lord Tathagata Merupradipadaya in the universe Merudaya sent to this universe 32,000 thrones. These thrones were so tall, spacious and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, shakras, brahmas, lokapalas and other gods had never seen the like.  The Ganges River, which runs from the Himalayas and empties into the Bengal Bay, is a huge river. One cannot even see across to the other shore. And there are as many lands as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. The land that is far away is Merudaya and its buddha is named Merupradapadaya. He has a throne that is inconceivably huge. Vimalakirti then used his supernatural powers–kind of like using a cell phone today–and then had delivered by freight–kind of like Japanese takubin today—all of these chairs delivered to the two-by-two meter room of Vimalakirti, and they fit there with no problem at all. With any common sense this would not be possible. Even with these many huge chairs in this small room there was no twisting or problem, and everything fit perfectly. When we hear this it sounds like a lot of bragging, but even in our own tiny physical eye fits a Mt. Rainier and the sky so full of far away stars. So we can’t call that bragging. We have to look at what our own amazing body and world can do.  (The roshi) recently received a photograph of the Andromeda Galaxy, and it was taken at home. Imagine that! We can photograph something as huge and far away as that, and yet we still stay hemmed in by thoughts about how terrible that person is and how could this person do that and how bad the economic situation is and shall we hang ourself or rob a bank. Here we have a huge mind that can create so many positive alternatives. It is this that the Vimalakirti sutra is pointing out.  These thrones were so spacious and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, shakras, brahmas, lokapalas and other gods had never seen the like. The thrones descended from the sky and came to rest in the house of the Licchavi Vimalakirti. The 32,000 thrones arranged themselves without crowding and the house seemed to enlarge itself accordingly. The great city of Vaisali did not become obscured, nor did the land of Jampudvipa nor the world of four continents. Everything appeared just as it was before.  Sutra At this time Vimalakīrti said to Mañjuśrī, “Take a lion seat and sit there along with the bodhisattvas and superior ones. You should adjust [the size of] your body to match the image of the seat.”   Those bodhisattvas who had attained the numinous penetrations immediately transformed themselves to become forty-two thousand yojanas [tall] and sat on the lion seats. But none of the beginner bodhisattvas or great disciples were able to ascend [to the seats].  Teisho Then Vimalakirti invited them all to get up on the thrones, which the bodhisattvas did with their supernatural powers. So why could they get up on those huge thrones? Because they do zazen and they know how to go beyond the zendo, swallowing it all down. To say our body is hurting and we are in bad shape here and there, it really doesn’t make any sense.  We do each breath as if we are filling a balloon– each breath, every breath–with every one of our 360 smallest joints, our 84,000 smallest hair pores, with all of them, with our whole body and being, to throw ourselves into this, one breath after the next. It is as if a balloon is being inflated. Our hair pores are standing on end. We would explode with a single touch of a pin. That mind that was caught on an ego is pierced through. We have to awaken to this state of mind, which we have been endowed with from the origin. There is nothing to be afraid of. No matter what suffering comes, to extend our hand to help. Our universe-sized awakening is already right within each of us.  But the unripe bodhisattvas, they were like the drivers in Japan who have the cars with the green leaf marks saying, “Please, if you’re afraid of how I drive, let me go slowly and you go ahead.” These young bodhisattvas, they didn’t quite have it together yet, and they were having a hard time getting up on those thrones. All of the experienced bodhisattvas could get right up on the huge thrones, but the disciples were having a hard time.  Sutra At that time Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “Take a lion seat.”  Śāriputra said, “Retired scholar, this seat is [so] huge I am unable to ascend it.  Teisho Vimalakirti asks Sariputra, who was the one who had asked for a chair in the first place, now that he had one why didn’t he sit down on it. “I can’t. It’s too big for me; I can’t get up on it.” We are always thinking in terms of our own size. But in fact, as Master Hakuin has said, “We are like one who in the midst of water cries out desperately in thirst. We are like the son of a rich man who wandered away among the poor.” In fact, we are water, but being caught on ourselves we always think that we are ice. We can’t fit as a plate-shaped piece of ice into a cup until we become water. If we try to adjust everything to our idea of our own size we can’t meet and merge with other things, always needing to be adjusted to. We have to become flexible and accommodate to whatever comes along, being free and open, not just waiting for a chair of our own size to come along.  Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, after you have worshipped Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata you will be able to sit there.  Then the beginner bodhisattvas and great disciples worshipped Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata and were immediately able to sit on the lion seats.  A prostration is something to be very thankful for, a way to let go of our ego, a way to become humble. It helps our circulation and also massages our organs. Prostrating is a wonderful thing. “Prostrate to the Tathagata. You will all be able to sit.” And as soon as they prostrated and became humble they were easily able to sit down on the tall thrones.  Sutra Śāriputra said, “Retired scholar, this is unprecedented! Such a small room has accommodated these huge seats, and there is no hindrance in the city of Vaiśālī, nor is there any distortion in the villages and towns of Jambudvīpa, nor in all the worlds of four continents, nor in the palaces of the gods, dragon kings, and demonic spirits.   Teisho If we climb to the top of Mt. Rainier we know this experience very well. We finally get all the way to the top of the mountain and we look down below us. The houses appear the size of a sesame seeds. And we know that in each and every house there are pains and there are pleasures. We can see all of them with a huge breadth of vision. But even though we can feel this hugeness of mind, again we get caught by what other people are doing all the time. People who go out into space see the earth spinning below them and they say, “In five minutes we can see the main countries of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam flying by, rolling below us. Why can’t people down there all get along, anyway?” They say they don’t want to return to such a complex world when it doesn’t have to be that way. “But it’s my home, and please, couldn’t we start getting along together!.”  Sutra Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, the buddhas and bodhisattvas have an emancipation called ‘inconceivable.’ For a bodhisattva residing in this emancipation, the vastness of [Mount] Sumeru can be placed within a mustard seed without [either of them] increasing or decreasing in size. Sumeru, king of mountains, will remain in appearance as before, and the gods of the [heavens of the four heavenly kings and the Trayastriṃśa [Heaven] will not sense or know their own entry [into the mustard seed]. Only those one is trying to save will see Sumeru enter into the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the teaching of inconceivable emancipation.   Teisho Next Vimalakirti teaches, responding to Sariputra who had been so impressed. Vimalakirti says to Sariputra: “It is not so mysterious that we can take all of this right into our mind.” The Diamond Sutra, says, “Abiding nowhere, awakened Mind arises.” Our mind, which then receives and becomes everything, is able to think and see and hear and perceive, but nevertheless, our mind has no form. Yet we can put everything into a person’s clear mind. This is truly the inconceivable and it is not mysterious; it is regular. When we are holding on to nothing at all, everything can be encompassed and received. It’s the bell, it’s the han, it’s the zazen. How often have we thought that we couldn’t put more in and then we let go and are able to receive and accept it all. But because we often don’t let go as we perceive, we feel this narrowness. As soon as we do let go we feel no more narrowness at all. If we are small, we get restricted; but letting go, we can truly even put Mt. Sumeru into a mustard seed.  Sutra “Also, [a bodhisattva] may cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single pore.   “[The bodhisattva does so] without discomforting the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the fundamental characteristics of those great oceans [remain] as before. The dragons, demonic spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into the single pore]. At this, the sentient beings [just mentioned] are not discomforted.  Teisho Next, the oceans are collected into a pore on the skin in the same way as Mt. Sumeru is put into a mustard seed. Just as when we walk into the library looking for a book we don’t look around and say, “How can I possibly ever read all of these books?” Once there was a priest named Chijo, and he was addressed by a scholar, Daigaku, who said to him, “How come Buddhism is always saying such grandiose things, making such huge statements?” To which the priest said, “Well, how about you? You’re a great scholar, and you’re called one who has read tens of thousands of books. How is it possible that all those books–he knocked him on the head and said— “How can all of those books possibly fit into a head like this, the size of a small coconut?”  To be able to read and receive so many books we have to be able to go beyond any idea of many and few or small and large. Vimalakirti is teaching how, in order to pry us away from being caught on these limiting ideas.  This all sounds like bragging, but if we stay small and caught, everything else also gets small. While we think that this is something about things outside of ourselves, it’s a mistake; all of this is right within us. And we see how all of it is only phenomena. If we try to see from our ego we always get stuck in a tight place, but if we open up and go beyond it we can pierce through it all.  Vimalakirti saw through Sariputra’s one moment of wanting a chair and picked up on it. Our body, its emotions–we think we can rely on them but we get confused by phenomena; this is taking us away from the source, which is the Dharma. That which has form is emptiness; that which is emptiness is form. This world and all existence is phenomena. The source of all of it is the Dharma. Since there is no other word or way to put it, some say that it is called something or other but if we don’t know the actuality of it we can get caught on each and every word, label, and every phenomenon in it. If we see in a phenomenal way, we only see the mental version, the ideas and the concepts; these are all phenomena. But the Dharma, when seen clearly, goes beyond even the inconceivable.  Five hundred years ago, in Togano lived Myoe no Shonin who wrote:  See this one, small, purple violet? This purple color– Who has dyed this flower this beautiful color?  This is a purple flower which is not separate from all other life. In it we can find infinite time, infinite space. We have to see this infinite place in this small flower–the inconceivable which is so much more huge than our narrow, mental calculations, a purple which science could not possibly imitate, and what would it want to do that for, anyway. The flower is the Buddha’s truth, but we are so caught by our own opinions about what we like and what we dislike that we get into confusion that never stops.  We are not doing zazen to save ourself only but to see how we are not just this small mind. When we see this huge Mind we can’t be restrained by our simply sore legs or a bumpy state of mind. It is not that only we are blind but that the whole world has somehow become blind like that. So here we see that there is a limit to that and we have to go beyond it.  What is being taught by Vimalakirti is the same thing we learn by truly doing zazen, but not by never asking when we deeply need to know. We have to sit to where we lose track of our own body and our myriad thinking. The sense of the zendo goes, and we enter deeply into this very instant in which the world has been drunk down completely. Zazen has a huge power. People in the zendo are fifty-three, and not one person there is thinking that I am here; there is this state of mind for everyone. We return to that true awareness that gives birth to mountains and flowers, gives birth to the zendo, to these lives everywhere. And even if we experience this depth, nothing changes, but our zazen opens us up to the possibility of experiencing it.  Sutra “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva residing in inconceivable emancipation who eradicates grasping of the great trimegachiliocosm does so just like a potter grasping a wheel in his right palm: were he to throw it past world-systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, the sentient beings within [that great trimegachiliocosm] would be unaware of where they had gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them would have any conception of having gone and returned, and the fundamental characteristics of this world-system would be as before.   “Furthermore, Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire kalpa and cause those sentient beings to consider it a kalpa. If there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire kalpa into seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.   Teisho The previous part was about space in the inconceivable, and now it is about time. For some people thirty minutes of zazen seems like a week or maybe even more because time is so hard to measure; it’s so subjective. That’s why we need a clock or a watch. But it’s not that a clock or a watch is time. Bankei Zenji would call one period of sitting one day; one day is one eon for some people. We are not such experts that we can make our time inconceivable yet. We sit for thirty minutes; we look at this and we see it clearly, this zazen. In the dojo we have a clock which marks the period of time it takes one stick of incense to burn. It can take longer for one stick of incense to burn on a damp day, and it burns faster in dry weather. In the temple bell world as well, time is measured in a particular way. The morning bell is rung when you can see the lines in your palm, because the sun has come up to that degree. And the evening bell is rung when you no longer can see the lines in your palm. You can understand well how this is always changing. It is no problem if things are a little late or if the sight of the person seeing his palm’s lines is different. Another difference is that in the winter we have 40-minute sticks of incense and we burn twelve of them a day in the zendo, while in the warmer months we have 20-minute sticks of incense and we burn eight of them in a day. Our sitting is different in the summer from how it is at other times. For people who are full of thoughts it feels as if it is taking so long for this period to be over. For people not thinking about a lot of things it goes by so fast. To become this place where there is no more time, this is zazen–to know the state of mind beyond time.  Teisho This place, where we forget time and space completely–only then can we understand how the 1700 koans were used for teaching 1500 years ago and not just given as a quiz. This is Zazen which goes beyond anything to do with time and space. And it is not about getting into a conditioned path or a preconceived notion about a pattern which has just been repeated and becomes automatic. It has to be something which is truly inconceivable.  Sutra “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation can assemble the ornaments of all the buddha lands in a single country to manifest them to sentient beings.   “Furthermore, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and fly to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can make visible in a single pore all the articles offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions. Also, he can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions.  Teisho Vimalakirti continues teaching Sariputra, reiterating the themes that were covered earlier in the section on the Buddha-lands. While the Buddha was deeply and immensely awakened, why does the world stay so deluded? There are mountains and rivers and garbage as well in this world. “Of course,” says the Buddha, “if you stay in this mind that looks from the eyes of discrimination it appears to be a soiled world.” If we instead become able to see deeply in this world–but then, how about a blind person? How would they see a Buddha-land? In this teaching the Buddha gave the truth. Sariputra also saw the whole picture. People without personal agendas and individual subjective views–we have to become like this, like one who can see from this huge view and then not lose it twenty minutes later.  It was on this very day ten years ago that we were visited by someone at 8 o’clock in the morning, telling us what had happened at the World Trade Center and sharing that it was indescribable and should be seen on the television, which was brought. Many people who were here doing sesshin at that time, on the same sixth day of sesshin, called home to their family’s cell phones to check on them. But no one left. Everyone stayed, everyone stayed right until the end of the sesshin. Many people said they were able to stay calm and centered because of having stayed here. The woman who had told us at first came back and told how everyone was being upset, watching the television playing the same horrendous scene over and over and over again.  Hanson’s Disease The roshi visits an island twice a year in which there used to be a place where people were sent against their will when they had been found to have Hanson’s Disease (leprosy). The people who were sent there were separated from their families; coming there against their wishes, many were so miserable at being sent to this island that they considered committing suicide immediately. On this island the young doctors and nurses care for these painful, damaged bodies, and after a little while the people who are suffering from Hanson’s Disease begin to understand how in fact they’re very fortunate to be there–how fortunate they are to actually be there. They begin to see the dandelions and the violets blooming in the grasses. They begin to see where it is that they actually are. These people who have no fingers, no eyelids, no lips—in the world people turn away from them and think they are monsters, but on the island they are well taken care of and even given spending money. They come there so full of anger and resentment, but then they find their way to being very full of gratitude. This is truly an inconceivable liberation.  Sutra “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can without physical harm inhale through the mouth all the winds of the worlds in the ten directions, and the trees outside [the bodhisattva] will not be damaged [by the winds].  “Also, during the kalpa-ending conflagration of the world-systems of the ten directions, he can take all the fires within his abdomen, and though the fires will be as before he will not be harmed.   Teisho Blue Cliff Records, Case 29 In the Blue Cliff Records, case 29, a monk asked Master Tai Zui, “When the great fiery ending of the world comes, will everything go? Will “it” go, too?”  A monk believed the sutras that say that the world will truly end with great fire, great water and then great wind. Millions of years ago this world was born, one celestial body in the Milky Way, continually expanding. But the expansion time will come to an end and it will decrease in power and will be sucked back into the contracting force of the galaxy, and at that time there will be great fire, great floods, and all the land will be covered with water. The great wind will blow and everything will be shattered into pieces and will explode. A monk asked the master about what happens then: “Will ‘this’ also go along?” The master said without hesitation, “It will go along.”  The monk was shocked. For what had he been doing all this training to realize Buddha-nature? Wasn’t it all meaningless then? He quickly left the area of Shisensho and visited Master Tosu, to whom he told what had happened and asked him his question. Master Tosu answered the exact same answer. Not only that, but hearing what he’d heard from Master Tai Zui he offered incense in his direction and said what a great thing it was to know that there was a truly awakened master. And then he got angry at the monk’s stupidity for having left that master and told him to go right back to Master Tai Zui, which he did. He hurriedly took another month and went back to Master Tai Zui, but when he got there Master Tai Zui was dead. So he went back to Master Tosu, and when he got there Master Tosu was dead. So while wandering around he had lost two great teachers. “Will it all go?” “It will all go right along with it.  But here what we have to realize is that truth that does not change–Vimalakirti’s inconceivable liberation. This decaying life energy, this decaying world: the deep awakening within this. The Buddha died, Bodhidharma died. It’s not about emotions or feelings but about our truest source. The truth still generates and regenerates our minds. People hear this and say, “Why bother, if we’re all going to die anyway?” But if we don’t touch on our True nature, then we cannot experience this clearly.  Sutra “Also, passing beyond buddha world-systems in the lower direction more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, he can take a single buddha land and lift it up in the upper direction, passing beyond world-systems more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River. Like holding a needle or a thorn, he is not inconvenienced [at all by doing so].  “Also, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation is able to use the numinous penetrations to manifest the body of a buddha, or to manifest the body of a pratyekabuddha, or to manifest the body of a śrāvaka, or to manifest the body of an Indra, or to manifest the body of a Brahmā king, or to manifest the body of a world lord (i.e., heavenly king), or to manifest the body of a universal ruler.   “Also, [a bodhisattva can take] all the sounds in the world-systems of the ten directions, high, medium, and low, and can change them into the sounds (i.e., voices) of the Buddha, playing the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self, with all the various Dharmas explained by the buddhas of the ten directions within those sounds, to be heard everywhere.   Teisho Next we have words from the Kanzeon Sutra–Kanzeon can change into the Bakushi Buddha, a very original buddha, into buddhas that appear in various forms, into Taishaku, the god of the heavens; when that is what is needed to liberate, a different form is entered into.  It can be the form of Benten, or Tenrinjo when that is most useful for bringing forth liberation; then Kanzeon can become that form. It is said that she can become thirty-three varieties of forms; that is how it is written, but that implies that she can become infinite forms. This is also inconceivable. If we are educated in the Way, we can become able to function in this same multifaceted way, like an actor or actress who knows that the roles they are given to play are already in them, within their own mind. Before they have even been given those roles they know those people and how to become them. Actors who can become completely that role are those who become excellent actors, ones who can cry very easily and have no trouble being very nasty and mean because these acts are all parts of what is already inside of them.  Once, in the olden days, there was a movie called “Buddha.” And in this movie of “Buddha,” never was the full-face version of the Buddha shown; it was always a silhouette because they would not want to show a dualistic face that would not be like the face the Buddha would have had. A silhouette was his fulfilled being’s expression. Within human beings, to bring forth our most evolved state of mind is inconceivable.  Each and every one of us can bring forth many different roles. But for doing training, to bring out that expression of a person of training is something that all of us can do, says Vimalakirti. As the master poet Sotoba, who trained for so long, has written:  The sounds of the valley streamsAre his long, broad tongue. The forms of the mountains Are his pure body. At night I heard the myriad sutra verses uttered— How can I relate to others what they say? \nTruly, that pure scenery is the Buddha himself—that mountain scenery which is so brilliant and clear! As Sotoba writes in another place, the willow is the blessed form of Kanzeon, and also uses all the various sounds to express the Buddha’s teaching, manifesting as tears, as cries, as sighs–all the teachings of the Buddha. All sounds that exist are in fact the teaching of the Dharma. This is not imagination but is the activity of the mind. The Buddha has so many various forms; all the sounds of the whole world are the resonance of the Buddha. But because we listen to them from our subjective way of hearing, we get upset when we are criticized, for example. If our dualistic, subjective listening mind is let go of, then we hear every sound there is as that of the Buddha’s teaching. This is also inconceivable.  Sutra “Śāriputra, I have now briefly explained the power of the bodhisattva’s inconceivable emancipation. If I were to explain it extensively a kalpa would be exhausted without completing it!”   Teisho Vimalakirti says that he has taught of the inconceivable liberation. “Now I will tell of clarifying the mind within, teaching about it from the external point of view.” Now is the inner purification process. Our mind source, as the scientists tell us, is from millions of years ago when life first came into being. There have been many phases of evolution since that first came into being. As Dogen Zenji says, we have to become educated from our original state of mind. It may be pure without any preconceived notions, but it is also a lump of flesh with an animal nature, and we then learn and evolve, going through an ego phase and not staying at being newborn.  We come with an instinct to learn, however. This is the Buddha-nature. While we can’t divide our mind this way, it is zazen that teaches us to be able to align with that part of ourselves that comes into being a human being who has let go of their animal nature and made stronger that nature which is well educated. While we never know what we will do next, we also work to improve and also to align our mind. We have school education as one way for doing this. According to studies of the human genome, we open to being educated at around four or five, educated into the way of being human. If we miss that opportunity we become more inclined to develop in the way of our animal nature. We know of the Children of Calcutta who were raised by wolves in a cave, so they would bare their teeth and glare, and while they knew no words they could still become very angry and aggressive. Two thousand words would be the usual number of words a young teenager would know, but even though educators attempted to bring these two children back into the human sphere as opposed to that of animal behavior, they could only remember fifty words. They were being given training to bring out their human nature instead of behaving like wolves, but it was a very difficult thing to turn that around.  In our minds we have a place that can learn if we are educated, and then that brings forth the wisdom with which we are naturally endowed to liberate others. Zen is what helps bring forth this wisdom, developing our mind and helping with our mind-body becoming one. This is our advanced polishing, and the ability to be able to do this is truly inconceivable.  With this, Vimalakirti’s teaching ends, and next we have Makakasho.  Sutra Then Mahākāśyapa, hearing the teaching of the bodhisattva’s inconceivable emancipation, exclaimed that it was unprecedented and said to Śāriputra, “It is as if someone displayed to a blind person all the colors and forms he cannot see. In the same fashion, when all the śrāvakas hear this teaching of the inconceivable emancipation, they are not able to comprehend it. When the wise hear it, who among them would not generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi?   “How is it that we have long cut off our capacity [for understanding]? With regard to this Mahayana we are like destroyed seeds. When all the śrāvakas hear this teaching of the inconceivable emancipation, they should all scream out a cry to shake the trimegachiliocosm. All the bodhisattvas should accept this Dharma with great joy.  “If there are bodhisattvas who devoutly understand this teaching of inconceivable emancipation, all the congregations of Māras will be unable to do anything to them.” When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand gods all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.  Teisho He was astounded at Vimalakirti’s teaching, and now his teaching also expounds the Dharma. It is just as Vimalakirti has taught us, but we have to have the ears to be able to hear it, for our mind, which is narrow, shuts us down before we’re even able to realize what a great teaching this is. If we try to hear this in a narrow context we could not possibly understand it. If we open our mind to realize this, then in the very opening it is possible to be realized because of the Buddha nature within all beings. Otherwise it is “like a burned and rotten seed” within each of us that is not able to break forth.  For the Mahayana, if we simply open our mind to this truth then we can understand and see this. In this way we can see how it is said in the Bible as well, that if a grain of wheat falls to the ground and rots it is not able to bring forth wheat, but if it is saved and planted it becomes wheat. It has a shell which has to go beyond being a shell. This is a small, hard shell, just like the hard shell of ego that surrounds us. When a mother hen produces an egg and sits on it, if the shell is not broken through, the life inside that egg dies and it becomes rotten. We all have this shell of an ego, and then zazen breaks through that shell and gives birth to our true self.  So how does this shell break? If we live for a small selfish reason it won’t break. But if we live for all beings it naturally breaks away because that is not ego. Of course everyone naturally wants to be awakened from the origin. We understand this, and we also understand how, at twenty months of age, we are thinking in terms of two, not one. Because of that, an ego comes forth and we use that ego to learn and evolve and make a life. But also because of that understanding of two, there is conflict. To liberate ourselves from this dualism we have to give birth to a new wisdom, and there is always friction in doing this. Or else we continue protecting our small self forever, never breaking through that shell. We have to decide to use the infinite great energy with which we are endowed from the origin in order to awaken and to awaken all beings. Not just humans, but all life energy. It’s all one life. When we are separate and isolated we feel powerless, but when we connect and unite and know our oneness directly we know how to go beyond that powerlessness and awaken all beings.  Sutra “If there are bodhisattvas who devoutly understand this teaching of inconceivable emancipation, all the congregations of Māras will be unable to do anything to them.” When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand gods all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.  Teisho As it is written, the purpose of the Buddhas in coming into this world is to reveal this truth, to proclaim this truth, to understand this truth, and to enter this truth. And piercing through that shell, our great wisdom is given birth as well. That is what it means to conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. Our way of living then is truly becoming a way that is inconceivable.  Sutra At that time Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa, “Sir, the majority of those acting as Māra kings in the incalculable asaṃkhyeyas of world-systems are bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation. They manifest themselves as Māra kings through the power of skillful means, to teach sentient beings.   Teisho Vimalakirti said that the bodhisattvas would know this teaching as true and their evil ways could not touch them. As Vimalakirti said, don’t be deceived; these only look like devils. They are only assuming the forms of devils to bring others to awakening and guard and guide their Path. Actually they are bodhisattvas in disguise. Usually we think that evil spirits are bad, but they have unusual powers and complex delusions and this brings forth their strong energy, like in the Bible when it is the devil who offers food to Christ when he is fasting, and Christ yells at the devil to be gone. This devil is testing the mind and in doing that cultivating us to go one level wiser and deeper.  Rasetsu And then there was Rasetsu [Rakshasa a demonic being], the ogre who ate human flesh. Everything in the world changes; nothing is eternal, not one single thing. That is the truth of this world. This is the song that Rasetsu was always singing: “Everything in the world changes, nothing is eternal, not one single thing. That is the truth of the world.” Then a person of training named Sessan Doji, said to him, “Hey, Rasetsu, wait! I know that! I know that too, but it is not only that things are decaying. There have to be two more lines to your song; it’s not going to be finished there. It is missing two lines. It is those two lines which are the points I need most to be able to liberate sentient beings. Please tell me those last two lines that you haven’t added onto the song yet.  I have spent my whole life searching for this very point, so please tell me. To which Rasetsu answered, “I’m hungry. I can’t talk now.” “Look, Rasetsu! You’re hungry and I don’t need this body, but before I give you my body, please tell me these last lines.” And Rasetsu told him, “If we let go of birth and death–this dualistic view, the view of phenomena that deludes us–we have only to see what is it that sees all of this.” “So that’s it! Now I get it!” The person of the Path cut his finger and with the blood which came from the finger that he cut he wrote down all of the lines, the complete song of Rasetsu, and threw himself into Rasetsu’s mouth. Then Rasetsu disappeared; he turned into Taishakuten, who embraced Sessan Doji and, wanting to help this person of the Path, took him to the heavenly realm. In this way Sessan Doji could learn the final truth for which he had yearned for years.  The monk had still been caught on the shadow of dualism, and this is why he needed a teacher that told him how Buddhas and devils are one and the same thing; both are nothing but phenomena. That is how realizing this can liberate us, and that is what Vimalakirti is teaching in this sutra.  That dualistic view is what keeps us confused and suffering, always thinking that there are good people and bad people, and discriminating. That is what leaves in us something so hard to get rid of and leaves us unable to become liberated. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us with the mysterious non-duality which is the actual truth.  Sutra “Also, Kāśyapa, as to the immeasurable bodhisattvas of the ten directions, there may be people who beg them for a hand, foot, ear, nose, head, eye, marrow, brain matter, blood, flesh, skin, bone, village, town, wife and sons, slave, elephant, horse, vehicle, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, sapphire, agate, coral, emerald, pearl, conch shell, clothing, or food.  “Beggars such as these are usually bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation, who use the power of skillful means to go test [the bodhisattvas] and make them resolute. Why? Bodhisattvas who reside in the inconceivable emancipation possess the power of awesome virtue and therefore manifest the practice of pressuring, showing sentient beings difficulties such as these. Ordinary people are inferior and lack energy, and they are unable to pressure bodhisattvas in this way. It is like the kick of a dragon or elephant, which is not something a donkey could withstand.  “This is called the ‘gate of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation.’”  Teisho There are so many kinds of devils! They ask people of the Path for their lives, their legs, their hands, and by doing that they bring this person of the Path into a place of being tested; the bodhisattvas’ awakening to true Mind is strengthened and becomes even more firm. For the devils to do things [to the bodhisattvas] that cannot usually be done are being done in order for the person of the Path to deepen in their Path and become like an elephant on whose path a donkey cannot tread. And in this way they can complete and fulfill their Path. This is an expedient means for bringing deeper wisdom to their awakening to true Mind. This is Vimalakirti’s true teaching.  Vimalakirti makes this teaching with everyone standing up a long time. He has seen each person’s deeply opinionated small self and is saying, “Don’t you want to realize that deeper truth by realizing inconceivable liberation?”  And finally even the devils and Maras are liberated. This is the true work of the bodhisattva: to not discriminate between bad people and good people. For this we have been born into this world, not to protect our egoistic small self but to awaken to all beings as one being. No matter what comes forth, to have this kind of hugeness and spaciousness of mind: to not be moved around, and to be able to have the strength of true sight to be able to see devils becoming bodhisattvas–not by our imagination but by resolving people’s weaker places inside. This is the way of the true Dharma.\n  ","id":55,"length":13718,"title":"Chapter 6: The Inconceivable - Vimalakirti and Manjusri continue their dialogue","type":"essay","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/chapter6/"},{"content":"Sutra  At this point Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “How should the bodhisattva view sentient beings?”  Vimalakīrti said, “As if he were a magician seeing a conjured person, so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.\n“Like a wise person seeing the moon in water, like seeing the image of a face in a mirror,\u2028like a mirage when it is hot, like the echo of a shout,\u2028like clouds in the sky,\u2028like water collecting into foam,\u2028like bubbles upon water, like the firmness of the banana tree, like the prolonged abiding of lightning, like a fifth element, like a sixth skandha, like a seventh sense, like a thirteenth entrance (āyatana), like a nineteenth realm (dhātu)—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.\n“Like form in the formless realm, like a seedling emerging from burned grain, like a stream-enterer’s mistaken view of the body, like a non-returner’s (anāgāmin) entrance into a womb, like an arhat’s three poisons, like a bodhisattva who has achieved forbearance breaking the prohibition against anger,\u2028like a buddha’s latent influences of the afflictions, like a blind man seeing forms, like the inhalation and exhalation of someone who has entered the concentration of extinction, like the tracks of birds in the sky, like the child of a barren woman, like a conjured person generating the afflictions, like waking up in a dream, like one who has entered nirvana being reborn, like fire without smoke—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.”\n Teisho In the Sutra’s seventh section Vimalakirti teaches about how we should see sentient beings. All living things are considered to be sentient, as we read every day in the Four Vows. In Buddhism not only humans but all living beings are sentient–bugs, fish, animals, plants. But we most usually refer to “living beings” as being human beings because they are the sentient beings most familiar to us.\nManjusri Bodhisattva was visiting Vimalakirti. All the other bodhisattvas and disciples had been asked by the Buddha to go and see Vimalakirti but, because in past encounters with him, the bodhisattvas and the top disciples of the Buddha had been reprimanded for their triviality and narrow-mindedness in ways that were correct for each one of them, all of the disciples and the bodhisattvas had turned down the Buddha’s request.\nThey had been told that that way of holding their mind was a great source of discrimination, so none of them wanted to go and visit the ailing Vimalakirti. This is why it ended up being Manjusri, the great bodhisattva of wisdom, who had gone for the Buddha to see Vimalakirti. We have just read previously in our teishos about this encounter.\nNow we have Vimalakirti answering Manjusri about his sickness further. Before, he had said, “I am sick because everyone in society is sick and I have taken on this sick body’s appearance because people are so attached. Because of this attachment, they are sick, and for them I have become sick in this similar physical body.” There was no wall for Vimalakirti between himself and all beings in the world. The world’s suffering was his suffering beyond any division between self and other. But no matter how long, how kind, how big Vimalakirti’s huge love is, the number of sentient beings is so immeasurable that if one were to carry this feeling like a parent—which Vimalakirti did—like a parent who can’t sleep at night when their child is sick, then that person would become sick as well.\nFor Vimalakirti it was everyone’s sickness that was of such great importance to him that he was trying to bring a resolution to it. So he is being asked by Manjusri, “With what eyes should we look upon the sentient beings in society? ‘Because everyone is suffering, I am also suffering.’ How should I see them then?” We all have to have this great love. But if we discriminate, then that is not the truest love and so we have these words of wisdom from Vimalakirti:\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “How should the bodhisattva view sentient beings?” Vimalakīrti said, “As if he were a magician seeing a conjured person, so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;  Teisho There are infinite human beings, all suffering; how should we encounter them? A magician is a master of slight of hand who brings people’s concentration to one focus, and then while their focus is held there, he changes things while people are not noticing. In the same way, a magician in one instant manifests form like our body. This is Vimalakirti’s own existence being looked at as well, and for everyone to see it like this. It is showing that there is no such thing as a fixed substance or form existing. The same thing is taught in the Heart Sutra where it speaks of all of our senses and then how there are none of them. The many trillions of cells in our body—Vimalakirti is referring to all of these and how we use them, thinking that we are alive, thinking that we are walking, thinking that we are doing, thinking that we are acting.\nHowever, it is all appearance, a dream, a phantom. And when we take these things as real, believing in them as existing, we then find that not to be the case, and here is where people suffer. While this is how it is for each and every person, we still get pulled around by our sense perceptions and get confused by thinking that what we are perceiving in our senses is actually existing. So no matter what we do we are always seeing endlessly in a mistaken way until we do, truly, actually realize.\nOtherwise we are like someone struggling in a bad dream, unable to wake up from this deluded perception of what’s happening. Of course this is only because we are attached to things that this happens. When we can awaken to the actuality we don’t have to continue seeing it in this way. We have to realize that it is all a dream.\nSeijo and her Sister In the T’ang Dynasty in China there was a very popular novel by Sokuten Bukko about a very wealthy father named Choitsu who had a beautiful, bright daughter named O-Sen (Seijo). She had a good friend named O-Chu from when she was very young. Both of them were children of good birth, handsome and beautiful; they would play together, and everyone would say how beautiful they were as children and what a great couple they would be when they grew up. O-Sen and O-Chu took this as a given that they would get married and someday raise a family. They became closer and closer as they became older. Choitsu, O-Sen’s father, unconcerned about their intimate connection, prepared to find his daughter a husband of good birth, but whenever this was mentioned, O-Sen would become more and more depressed and dark. And O-Chu, also depressed at the idea of O-Sen marrying someone else, decided to leave for a different city and make a life there on his own. So he went off by boat. But O-Sen could not stand the idea of his leaving, and she followed him. She followed him all the way to Koshu, and at twilight O-Chu heard his name being called from behind. It was impossible; he had just arrived there and knew no one! But from behind appeared O-Sen, who had followed him, and he joyfully received her to live together in this land of Shoku.\nFor five years they lived together and had a child. But after about five years O-Sen became very gloomy and wanted to see her father whom she had left and not seen for the whole interim. Her husband said that he had had the same feeling, that they should go back and apologize that he had taken her away. They decided to take their child and go to see her father and apologize.\nWhen they reached the port, O-Chu first went to Choitsu’s house to tell him what had happened and apologize, leaving his wife and their child in the boat. He knocked and when the door opened–maybe the maid had been out for the day–it was Choitsu himself who saw O-Chu and said it had been five years and how had he been?\nO-Chu said, “I’ve come to apologize that I took your daughter.” And the father said, “What are you talking about, you took my daughter? My daughter O-Sen? She’s in the back room sleeping! She’s been depressed for the past five years and won’t talk and hasn’t been seeing anyone. I’m getting older and I’m very concerned about what to do about this daughter. Are you sure you aren’t mistaken?” To this O-Chu said, “No. I’ve known your daughter well since childhood; I’m not mistaken. I’ll bring her and you can see, and see our child as well.” Then when he brought O-Sen to the door of her father’s home, at that very same instant the O-Sen from the back room who had been sleeping, gloomy and depressed for five years, came forth. And she and the O-Sen who had just arrived from the boat became one.\nThis story was used by Master Goso Hoen who asked his monks, bullying them and attacking them with this difficult question, “Which of these is the real O-Sen?” Master Goso Hoen Zenji puts forth this question for all of us! Similarly, Master Rinzai says, “In this five-foot lump of red flesh there is a true person of no rank, always coming in and out of all of the orifices. If you haven’t seen it yet, see it now!”See it now! Everyone uses these eyes and these ears—to be able to know that even so there is still no form and no shape!\nYet we are happy when we are happy, we are sad when we are sad. We are very freely operating human-ness that has been able to become the flowers and the rivers and the moon and the sun. And with our ears, the songs of the birds, the sounds of the wind, the sounds of the bell, people’s voices. And with this nose, all of the scents and the fragrances. For this mouth, all of the flavors and tastes. With the body, feeling cold and feeling hot. Our body is truly able to pierce through and experience past, present and future! We live that! And yet there is nothing fixed about what is manifesting; we give birth to a huge world. This is the life of a human being.\nWe have these five senses and from them comes our idea of what our human character is. But since we are always thinking that we are something that is acting in an absolute way, we limit our true mind in that way.\nIt is just as if we are staying in a sleepy, vague, play about our mind. It is not that we have two sides but that we have a physical side which is included in this greater side; we are not limited by this physical side alone. In our zazen we can let go of all of these senses of being only a human body and all of its sensations and realize this huge, wide open world, this greater Mind which is unlimited. And for realizing this directly we do zazen. This huge, wide open freedom is so often left unrealized!In this way Master Goso Hoen is saying not to get caught on this small body which we are simply borrowing, when we could be giving birth to great joy and freedom! He is not meaning that there is no need for this physical body, but that there is no need to be caught on it as absolute, or to be caught on it in terms of thinking of it as being something which is good or bad, winning or losing. But rather, to really know its greater wisdom and see that our small thoughts are not our absolute functioning.\nTo awaken our true functioning and realize our greater life. To not just see with our eyes, thinking that is all there is, but to open up our deepest wisdom which can liberate others’ suffering. And with this huge, wide open awakening, to just see how things had been until then perceived as if in a narrowing dream. Then we can experience the actual freedom. These things like sickness and weakness of ki we thought we had—when we see this from the bigger picture we understand that while we may be affected by them they are not who we are. This is the Buddha Dharma.\nAfter five years living away, O-Sen and the O-Sen from the back drawing room—these two instantly became one, a huge One: the one who gives birth to the sun, the moon, the flowers, the mountains, from this huge Mind. When we realize this we see that although we have many encounters each and every moment, each and every one is not done from some desperate, stuck way of seeing but always opening to infinite new possibilities. This is human’s liberation.\n“As a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water”–those who see it as the reflection of the moon in the water do not think it’s the moon, they see it as a reflection of the moon in the water and just a reflection. When we are having a hard, desperately difficult feeling time, we know it will be over–like seeing that which has passed before, like seeing that the reflection in the mirror always fades. In each and every moment, in each and every situation, we can realize that.“Like a wise person seeing the moon in water, like seeing the image of a face in a mirror,\u2028like a mirage when it is hot, like the echo of a shout,\u2028like clouds in the sky,\u2028like water collecting into foam,\u2028like bubbles upon water,”\u2028In the flimsy heat waves that come from the ground when the weather starts getting warm–the heat waves that look as if there is something humid coming from the ground that does not really exist–like an echo being called from far away which appears to be a sound that someone is making, like a mass of clouds in the sky, like a mist from which rain then forms: in this way phenomena are to be perceived. This does not mean to see things that exist as unimportant because they are transient, but to see that we are not fixed and we are not trapped, and to not get caught on an idea that we are something small and limited. It’s not that these things don’t exist, but to not hold onto them in a small way as a fixed existence; rather, to hold to the infinite regenerative ability of being human, and to see this wisdom which embraces all and with which we are all endowed! We are able to realize unthinkable wisdom! In this way Vimalakirti is telling us.\nFor different people there are different ways to live. Some people go straight ahead, simply. Some are more apparently clumsy and always bumping into things. But we can’t be in despair, nor can we slide over things because they’re simple. Mind is huge and infinite and has many ways to live, and we can’t lose sight of our infinite potential. This is what Vimalakirti is saying–that in each moment we have to see what is the best way to live; he is not saying that because it is transient it is melancholy. Even while we may live through some time of great confusion and challenge, to realize that we have infinite wisdom and creativity. This innate, infinite, inner wisdom, this is the universe we live in. To know this infinite universe and know that this is our true base. To see that there is no end to this and to see it widely and hugely!\nVimalakirti says that those who are confused and deluded in the world—this is the way they should be regarded. We usually think of those with physical challenges and offer them everything we possibly can. Any person in the front line of caregiving feels this huge pressure to give everything possible, and we can see how many who are working there get burned out from living this way. Vimalakirti tells us the best way to regard all living beings, to hold one’s mind in these situations–including those who are on the front line of trying to give help to people who are physically challenged. It is like seeing a magician, a sleight of hand artist, where one’s attention is whisked away to a different direction and in one instant the scene changes, a trick is performed. It is like that instant that we should perceive this, but then instantly perceive the moon reflected in the water.\nLike that story of the old pond in the woods right near a forest full of monkeys, who always live in groups: the monkey boss looked at the old pond and saw that into the pond the moon had fallen. He was astonished. The moon had fallen into the pond! It was their moon that made their night bright with light, and now it had fallen into the pond; it would never be bright at night again. This couldn’t be! They had to return it to the sky no matter what. So the boss monkey led them, and all the monkeys made a big chain holding arm to arm. By grabbing hands they made a chain from the top of a tree, and just as they had only a short distance to go to reach the moon that had fallen into the pond, the weight of so many monkeys pulled the tree’s branch down and they all fell in and drowned. It was only that this moon had been reflected in the pond, like the heat waves on a pavement on a spring day that have no substance.\nOr like an echo in the mountains with no person speaking it. Or like clouds in the sky which are always passing and transient. Or if we get caught, stuck on an idea, it’s like a ball of foam on the water. We can see that these things cannot be held onto.\n Sutra “Like the appearance and disappearance of a bubble of water”\u0026hellip;.  Teisho Heshiro We have the Rohatsu Exhortations of Master Hakuin, and in it is written the story of Heshiro, a wealthy man in the village of Ihara who had given the money to have a statue of the Immovable Fudo Bodhisattva built. This statue was being placed by the village near a waterfall, and on the day of its unveiling they all sat to honor it. Heshiro, being the main supporter, sat in the place of the guest of honor, by where the waterfall fell. As he sat there as the feast was served, Heshiro couldn’t help but notice that as the water fell, many bubbles came forth and moved downstream. He’d seen this waterfall many times, but he’d never before noticed these bubbles coming down the waterfall. Some of them would go two feet and then pop, some of them would go a few inches and pop, some of them would go five or six feet and pop, but eventually all of the bubbles–every single last one that came down the waterfall–all of them popped. And then he realized suddenly that this\nwas just like people and their lives ending. And it hit him that “just like that, I’m going to die, too, just like one of those bubbles popping!” There are children, mere babies, that die. There are school children, and even at that age, some of them die. Some people, at the height of their work in society, doing the best possible job they could have wanted, and right there and then they die. Some people live to a ripened old age, and they die then. But everyone does die. No matter what kind of a strong, well-developed human being it is, for every single person that eventually fades. This is what Heshiro realized. He felt this so deeply, he panicked in response.\nA plantain tree from the southern countries has huge leaves. And if we take off these plantain leaves one at a time, if we unfurl them, removing one leaf after the next leaf, we find there’s no trunk or core inside of them. This whole tree is only furled leaves. Humans have splendid looking bodies, but nothing there that lasts–like that brightness of a flash of lightning, immediately over like our life span relative to the millions of years that have passed before it.\nThere are the four elements of the cosmology of ancient India–earth, wind, fire, and water, which make up all of the material world. Fire, our body’s warmth, the earth’s heat. Wind, the always changing weather, our breathing. Elements are our base, but earth, wind, fire, and water, have one more, a fifth, and that is emptiness. It is that emptiness into which those elements fade when they are not coming together to build something material. These elements gather and then scatter and return to that empty space. The four elements make up all of the objects in the universe, but emptiness, it has no being to it. It is to this emptiness that all elements return because they are only phenomena.\nOr it is like our six senses and their six perceptions and the activities that come from those perceptions such as, “I’d like to take that flower home. It smells so good!” But in these senses there is no further sense given. This gathering of senses is empty. There are only five aggregates–form, sensation, perception, mental formation, and consciousness–but no sixth. We have several primary emotions that number six. But the number seven is also emptiness. And so is this true of the twelve perceptions and memories as written in the Heart Sutra. We see a red flower and remember, “This is a flower that is red.” And while we have those three sets–three memory sets for each of the six senses, making eighteen–the nineteenth is always empty. The bodhisattvas look at the world, and if they don’t see it as phenomena, they won’t be seeing it correctly. But when people see the way things look like this or they hear this way of perceiving, they say, “How melancholy! How lonely and sad!” Anyone will see this as so fragile and empty, but without seeing it in this way also, there is no way to truly liberate humankind.\nIt seems that Vimalakirti is speaking about things in such a sad and lonely way. However, today there are more than six billion people in the world and they each have their own individual way of perceiving. If each of us pushes what we want most for ourselves, of course this will end up in a lot of conflict and in the resources of this earth becoming exhausted. Maybe it will work while we can get what we want, but when that’s over it will come to great conflict. Two thousand five hundred and fifty years ago the wisdom of the Buddha came forth to guide us in this situation, teaching that there is no personal single, ego but that the billions of people are one life energy. Seeing it this way it is not melancholy; to see in this huge, expansive way, or we cannot truly see clearly. This is the wisdom of the Buddha Dharma, and without it we will, of course, end up in conflict.\nWe can’t attempt to completely discard personal ego. But rather, to acknowledge the one life energy of all beings and bring the benefit of that acknowledgement into focus; then our wisdom is born. It’s not only about a world with life and death, but to also see beyond that life and death, to see that birth and death as one continuum of that one life energy. The ancient universe has been continuously giving birth to it, and within it there are phenomena which are endlessly transforming. To see it like this or we will continually be misunderstanding; this is the wisdom of the Buddha, teaching us how there is no fixed, absolute, personal ego. If we try to succeed only on the basis of our ego, we will always fall into despair if we fail. This is what keeps us in suffering.\nBodhidharma and Emperor Wu Bodhidharma’s arrival in China was excitedly anticipated by the Emperor Wu, who wanted to tell him about all of the things he had done to support Buddhism in China. He told him about all the temples he’d built, the monks he’d ordained, the sutras he’d translated, and he asked Bodhidharma about what merit he had earned. To that, Bodhidharma replied, “There’s no merit in that.” He wasn’t saying that the emperor’s efforts were bad. He was saying that instead of being bright and clear from having worked so hard, he was caught on being praised for having done it. We have no need to hold on to such thoughts, but we don’t want to miss a chance for being praised. This is our weak place, and the Buddha helps us out with it. This is how we can be led and helped by his showing us the bigger picture.\nThe moon last night was bright, huge, and expansive, full of shining moonlight. As the ancients poetized about, under the chill night moonlight, doing zazen with not a single person passing by we melt into oneness with that bright, radiant moonlight. The wind blows. We feel as if we are one with nature. Becoming the wind we are one with the heavens and earth. We become that wind, we become that moonlight. We lose track of whether we are shining or the moonlight is shining, we are just this huge, expansive life energy of our being alive. Even if we know nothing of Buddhism, to once in our lifetime experience this hugeness of becoming one, melting into the heavens and earth completely, not only staying as a small, limited individual!\nThree thousand years ago they were seeing this very same moon, and three thousand years from now they’ll be seeing this very same moon. We have the place within us, within each of us–maybe dogs and cats don’t have that place–to see with this huge state of mind. This is wisdom. It is not just being intoxicated, but to realize this very life energy and Mind which is who we all are.\nIf we were to say what zazen is, it would be about realizing this huge Mind. Maybe there are difficult challenges in the beginning with our legs and our sitting, but we move through those. And even if there is no great, splendid moonlight and there are times when life is difficult with our work, with our relationships, and we see that as an individual in this world we may be challenged, nevertheless we are also this huge Mind as well.\nWords and phrases and studies show us what we are in some ways, but there is this huge Mind as well which is beyond words and phrases and any kind of calculation. This is what Vimalakirti wants us to know. We are not limited and isolated; it is our truth that we are this huge, enormous, spacious Mind. As one of the ancients, Reisha Shibi Zenji, has said, ”This huge world is my eye.” And as another, Jo Hoshi, said, “This world and I are one and the same root. Everything in this world and I are one.” We are this mind that perceives like this!\nWe all have common experiences and we all have various other experiences that differ, and it is difficult to erase many of them that are very hard. But if we realize this huge, enormous Mind, seeing from there, we don’t need to repeat the same mistakes twice. This is not about being saved by God or being saved by a buddha. Let in this huge, enormous Mind in order to purify and to clarify our unskillful ways!\nThis huge Mind: to know that we live in this great Mind, and then we don’t get caught on the phenomena that are always passing by, and we can easily let go of our own anger, greed and ignorance. We have to awaken to this great Mind, and when we do we will melt away our insecurity, our pain and our suffering. We are born as this mind; it is our true source. We have only lost track of it by mistake. To remember this and to realize it again we need to awaken.\n Sutra “\u0026hellip;like the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm;\n“Like form in the formless realm, like a seedling emerging from burned grain, like a stream-enterer’s mistaken view of the body, like a non-returner’s (anāgāmin) entrance into a womb, like an arhat’s three poisons, like a bodhisattva who has achieved forbearance breaking the prohibition against anger,\u2028like a buddha’s latent influences of the afflictions, like a blind man seeing forms, like the inhalation and exhalation of someone who has entered the concentration of extinction, like the tracks of birds in the sky, like the child of a barren woman, like a conjured person generating the afflictions, like waking up in a dream, like one who has entered nirvana being reborn, like fire without smoke—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.”\n Teisho Here Vimalakirti continues to describe our attachments, the first being that of the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm. We have the three realms: the realm of desires, the realm of form, and the realm of the formless from which we perceive things. One who sees a flower and wants to sell it for profit, that’s the realm of desire. One who sees a flower and wants to study it–that’s the world of form. One who sees a flower and wants to write a poem or song about it–that is the formless realm of poets and artists. Just as there are these three realms in this same world, though we see the same object, people see it in many different ways. Some see it in a formless or even a spiritual way, some see it as real, capable of being perceived by our senses, and some from an attachment to it—they see it in a way that they want to hold on to it.\nNo living growth can be found in a rotten seed. A once-returner is one who does not want to return and yet has still got greed, anger and ignorance–like a childlike person who is empty-minded (which is the ideal of the Way of the Buddha Dharma) but who is still hanging onto things. Like a person who has no depth of breath in their meditation practice and is just breathing in and out. Like a bird that leaves no traces in the sky but is suddenly leaving traces in this world. If we see that there is this huge Mind, then our sense of phenomena no longer leaves those traces. Like saying that the wooden puppet Pinocchio would have desires, or to have a something left remaining that exists after a dream, or to have smoke where there is no fire.\nIn this way Vimalakirti tells how to liberate our attached mind by not being drunk down by phenomena. In the same way, to not be caught on our typical, usual views of the narrow, limited mind, and when we feel great sympathy or empathy or wanting to help someone, to not get drowned in those feelings either. When we get caught and stuck in our feelings of wanting to help, we get intoxicated by them so easily. In doing that we make even more difficulties for others when what we’re trying to do is help. We have to get free from all of these perceptions that are based on our own narrow idea of what we are. And for doing that we have to keep away from being caught on appearances.\nWe get caught on each and every phenomenon and then cannot see and function from a greater, all-inclusive point of view. One of the astronauts on the Apollo 9 mission was Russell Schweickart who was the father of one of the Roshi’s long ago disciples. Rusty Schweickart came to Japan to see his newly born grandson, and he also came to visit Sogen-ji and told the Roshi that when doing a docking experiment on a mission in the early days he had realized that we human beings standing on this globe, on this planet, only see the earth as two-meter-tall beings relative to the horizon. We see each other in that way also. Whereas if we see the planet from the astronaut’s viewpoint: this Earth which flies by so quickly, rotating completely in five minutes; Buddha’s country passes, Christ’s country passes, all these go whirling by, and on the face of this Earth there are all of us people together and they are arguing all the time! We are taking for granted that our small views are correct. But if we were to leave this planet, where would we exist? We need to see that clearly. The Buddha did not need to leave the planet to see it this way; he saw with this same wisdom and he saw how important it is to see from this huge perspective. That is what Vimalakirti is teaching, that what is most important is wisdom.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī said, “If a bodhisattva views sentient beings in this fashion, how should he practice sympathy?” Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who views [sentient beings] in this fashion should think to himself, ‘I should explain the Dharma for sentient beings in this fashion, and this will constitute true sympathy.”   Teisho Vimalakirti speaks of how, with all the suffering beings, we mustn’t be attached to their pain and suffering. That which they are manifesting as pain and suffering we are confusing with the phenomenon of their apparent sickness, and that makes them suffer even more and take longer to get better. So while there may be an appearance of sickness, we shouldn’t think of them as a person who is sick and always feel that they are a person who is needing our help. We should be always fresh and always fresh again, or they will get even sicker because of our way of seeing them. This is an important function of bodhisattvas in the world: to not be deceived by appearances. It is not about a mental view of sick or healthy, but to see from the view of the huge, expansive Mind, or we will be fooled by their phenomena. Vimalakirti says this from many angles here. We can’t look at society from our emotions.\nIf we see this all as phenomena, then won’t we lose our intention to help them compassionately? Vimalakirti is teaching that all this sickness and health are all phenomena. But if we see that it’s only phenomena, then does it makes us not feel compassion toward them? This is what Manjusri is asking Vimalakirti.\nFirst, Vimalakirti responds that that which appears as sickness gets confused because from the origin these manifestations are not actual. How can we liberate people from this? If there are symptoms of a cold, for example, we see those symptoms, but they are merely phenomena being manifested. That doesn’t change the person and the true nature of the person who is manifesting them. When the cold is over, the person is not changed. Vimalakirti is telling us to teach them things like this. Cancer, AIDS, there are so many things that medicine cannot cure yet. But Vimalakirti is saying to tell people they are this very healthy Original Mind no matter what is manifesting, and not to say, “Oh you poor thing! Currently, one of the Roshi’s disciples is in this very situation and the roshi sends him all of these teishos.\nPeople are always trying to tell him what he should do to take care of his symptoms, to comfort him, but he doesn’t want to hear it. He feels that they’re all pushing him into becoming a sick person by considering him in that way; he feels very pressured by this quality of attention and doesn’t want to see people very much because this is how he’s being addressed. He appreciates them coming to visit him very much, but while he’s only being told it once by each person–they’re all only telling him once about his being ill–he’s hearing it over and over again by everyone he encounters. And even if we don’t think that we’re sick, we begin to think we are from being told it that many times. It is important to be able to realize and address a person’s healthier part.\nMuso Kokushi In Kyoto at the temple of Tenryu-ji, the founder Muso Kokushi, was asked many questions by the younger brother of Ashikaga Takauchi, who was Ashikaga Tadayoshi. These questions and their answers were collected in a collection called “Conversations in a Dream.” If we are doing training, Tadayoshi asks, wouldn’t we be able to know about suffering? And Muso Kokushi answers, “People in the world think they are suffering, but that is only like a dream.” That people think they are suffering is only because people think that they are suffering. If someone is having a bad dream, then someone next to them would shake them awake and say, “Hey! Wake up! It’s only a bad dream!”\nWe imagine that we are sick or that we are very poor, and while others agree with this by sympathizing or overly empathizing with us, we ourselves have a hard time remembering that this is only phenomena, and we get more and more attached to this phenomena that we dream we are experiencing and going through. A sick person is told this doctor is the best or this medicine is what they should to be taking, but that is not what you would call healing them. It could be only making their ego stronger around this when to help let go of this ego is the work of the bodhisattva. We think we are comforting them but we are actually strengthening their ego’s attachment to being in this situation. No matter what situation, to see how fortunate we are to be alive, to be here today. To awaken to this is today’s way of liberation.\nThe tree’s buds are swelling in this Spring light’s soft rays, and if we can see it like this–a fine awakened view–suffering is a dream. Awakening people to that, bringing their attention to the actuality of the perception of their five senses as they receive the sight of those Spring buds swelling and that Spring light shining, to the joy of these perceptions, not attending to the pain and suffering! To show them the actuality of this joy, this is true compassion. How often do we see things suddenly and think, “Wow! I was really in a dream! I was just seeing that as if I was in a dream!” To awaken people from that and to not get overly empathetic and make it even worse for someone who perceives himself as someone suffering.\nIn fact, life and death are only divided by a thin piece of paper. To see that clearly and to be thankful for being alive today, for today’s life energy that is mysteriously supported by so many; yet,how fragile that life energy is—it could be gone by tonight. We have received these five senses to use to taste and feel the truth of today’s life energy, not to be worrying about what is going to be coming. Our bodies, this world, are changing in every single second. If we see that as melancholy it is because we are caught on phenomena. Not only to have that view but to see that we are alive, and realize that deeply. Not to be caught on transiency as something that is melancholy, and to see it only as that which makes us have a hard time and makes it difficult for us to know this deep gratitude for being alive in this very moment. We think, “I am suffering so much more than anyone else!” To awaken someone to the great joy of being alive at this very moment, that is true compassion. Vimalakirti is teaching this clearly here.\n Sutra Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who views [sentient beings] in this fashion should think to himself, ‘I should explain the Dharma for sentient beings in this fashion, and this will constitute true sympathy.\n“‘I should practice the sympathy of extinction, because of the absence of anything generated;\u2028practice the sympathy of no-heat, because of the absence of the afflictions;\u2028practice the sympathy of sameness, because of the sameness of the three periods of time;\u2028practice the sympathy of nondisputation, because of the absence of generation;”\n Teisho It is not bad that we feel we have to do something for someone who is suffering. But trying to fix them is not the best way to be with them compassionately. Rather, to see them as we see our own face in the mirror. We experience what they are going through as if it is our own pain, our own experiencing, and then we can intuitively move, knowing spontaneously what to do just as if it was our own insecurity, our own pain. Not with an idea of, “Now what should I do for this person? What could I possibly do for them?” in a separated, non-intimate way. Because we can feel their pain as our own we can know directly what it is that needs doing. The sun shines everywhere. It is never worrying about which place it should now shine. There may be clouds that block it, but it’s always shining without thinking about, “Shall I shine down here, or shall I shine a little over there?” Because we feel another as our own energy and our own pain, we leave our ego out of it and we move intuitively—not because we think we should be doing something or trying to figure out what the right thing is. We are at one with them in a quiet way, not all excited to see what we can possibly do to help them right away, right now. We can see in a peaceful way.\nWe know about these kinds of peace demonstrations that claim that peace is the best and then end up in violence. How strange to anyone watching people carrying peace signs and fighting during the demonstration! People get excited and want to help, but their way of giving help puts so much pressure on the person receiving the help. Then if that person says, No, they don’t want that help, the visitor goes home with hurt feelings, feeling that they weren’t heard. The Buddha’s compassion is the same for all. We feel it not only for our own children or for people and animals that we feel are ours, but for all things–for cows, for dogs, for horses—equally we feel it. We feel that compassion all the way through the present, the past, and the future.\nIf the person is suffering, then we need to respond intuitively and directly to that suffering, and in that there is no past, present and future. In this kind of deep compassion and love it’s not about time. And we don’t need to be accepted or thanked for our help. The bodhisattva is always in equilibrium, and there can be no conflict in our mind when we are manifesting and coming forth from true compassion. This is what Vimalakirti is saying.\n Sutra “Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high resolve unbreakable, like a diamond;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of no-heat, because of the absence of the afflictions;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of sameness, because of the sameness of the three periods of time;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nondisputation, because of the absence of generation;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonduality, because of the nonconjunction of interior and exterior;  Teisho If we look at things in a melancholy way we may think there is no future, but if we are not caught in dualism we are experiencing everything, and we can see it all as a manifestation of Buddha nature. If we are deeply rooted in that awareness there is no being caught on phenomena. While we are seeing things we are not being caught on whether they are male or female, good or bad, sick or healthy. This is how Buddha nature truly manifests. Compassion comes forth spontaneously from our true nature. We see as if it is only a reflection in a mirror of our own face, and we accept things exactly as they are, without any dualistic perception added on whatsoever.\nIf we see another person and think, “I must do something! There must be something I have to be doing! What should I be doing?” then we will dualistically perform what seems to be a helpful act. Rather, it has to be done from the most clearly seeing place where we see another as one’s self with no separation. Whether the person realizes it or not cannot be our concern; we do it because we have to, from this place of nowhere at all where there are no desires, no plans, and no agendas. Not needing them to appreciate our doing it, not depending on being thanked for it and praised for it. If we have no agenda we will not try to force someone to receive it or see our way of helping as the best way for someone else.\nAs the Sixth Patriarch said, “From the origin there is not one single thing.” We have to experience it in this way also. As we have read earlier in this same text, if our mind is clear, then everything becomes clear, with no discrimination, no distinction. This is true, deep compassion, like today’s huge, bright blue sky, compassion for all people, wide open, all inclusive. This activity is truest compassion.\nUmmon Bun’en Zenji, the founder of the Ummon line, once said to his disciples, “The world is so vast and so wide, so why at the sound of the bell do we go to the hondo and put on our robes?” [Gateless Gate#16] Look up at the huge sky! So why do you sit zazen when four small bells ring? And when the bell is sounded, why do we start sutras? Why do we do it? Zen is vicious; it leads us into doing something and then leads us to question and doubt why we are doing this: What is it that is doing this, and why?\nMaster Bankei, who lived 300 years ago, wrote that the True Master is the name for everything that exists wherever we are. Not to be rigid and tense no matter where we are, no matter the circumstance, is the True Master. This is huge freedom! We can usually do it at home when we relax, but to be able to do that anywhere we go, that is the truest, greatest freedom.\nEvery single person in all of these three realms is my child. Every place that there is in these three realms is my home.\nTo see it in this way is to be the True Master of the world, sleeping and waking comfortably anywhere. To be able to be that Master and to be able to realize it in every single situation; this is our True Master to be freely used wherever we are. Not to be using it conditioned by some idea of how our small self thinks it should be, but instead wondering who is using those senses, not thinking there has to be an “I” there. To use them beyond and without that “I.”\nFurther, Master Bankei has said that our parents only gave birth to our true Buddha Mind. That is not something that has any limits. It is not something which is confined by preconceived notions. “That Unborn Buddha nature! Everyone hears me speaking,” said Master Bankei—they have come to hear him—“but behind, the birds are singing, the wind is blowing; we didn’t come to hear birds singing and wind blowing, and yet it enters our ears. We hear it, we perceive it. We naturally hear that.” Everything in the world is not something that happens because we plan it to happen. That which receives whatever happens, naturally—that is the True Master. But because we use the world of mental ideas instead of our True Master, we stay hard and stuck. The Buddha nature is just like a mirror, directly receiving and perceiving.\nThis pure nature does not manifest without the deep activity of wisdom coming forth. That wisdom comes forth from the non-dualistic Buddha nature, and we do zazen to realize and cultivate this because often our experience and our awareness bring us into dualism and then we are not acting freely. For this we want to know the deeper truth of our actual experience. For this we all have to return to our huge, original Mind which perceives directly both pain and suffering. But it cannot then be filtered through our ego. This seems simple, but it is not. We have to first deeply return to that true nature, and for this we have osesshin.\nUp until this point it has been about how voidness gives birth to compassion—the Void, that holding on to nothing at all in our mind, no opinion about something, no preconceived notion. From there comes the truest compassion–the will of the heavens and earth, it could even be said.\nWe have the story about the emperor Wu. He was waiting in China when Daruma Daishi came, and he asked Daruma Daishi, “What is the ultimate truth of the Dharma?” To this Daruma Daishi responded, “Only emptiness, nothing holy.” Emperor Wu was in fact a very adept scholar of Buddhism, and he had seen to the ordination of many people, built temples, and translated sutra books. He knew the Way of the ordained, the Way of the Bodhisattva, and here he asks about his merit for having done all of those things, as well as the question of what is their highest truth. To this, Daruma Daishi answered simply, “Only emptiness, nothing holy.” Speaking truthfully, he said that there would be no merit from any of this. The emperor Wu continued, not necessarily satisfied with the answer, and said, “I believe that you are a Buddha who has come here from India, but tell me, who are you really?” To this, Bodhidharma answered, “I don’t know.” In this way the emperor had no further place to land any more questions for Bodhidharma. Emperor Wu hadn’t a place to go with that.\nBut in fact there is nothing more truthful for any human to answer than to say this: “I don’t know.” Only collected secondhand information could replace it, when we each have been endowed from the origin with the being of the way of the heavens and earth. We have eyes, but no one ever had to teach us how to use those eyes. We have ears; no one had to teach us how to hear. We have a mind and no one has ever had to teach us how to use it to understand. We wonder what we are seeing and we learn that it is red and a flower, but no one had to teach us how to see that flower. We learn that that which is making that sound which is called barking, is a dog. But we don’t need to be taught how to hear that dog. To directly perceive pain and suffering we don’t have to be taught. We all have the ability to directly perceive sadness or suffering; we don’t have to be taught that by anyone. We know without explanation what it is to be insecure or to be sad; we feel these things spontaneously. Vimalakirti talked about these things, and now it changes tone.\n Sutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nondestruction, because of the ultimate exhaustion [of the characteristics of sympathy];“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of resoluteness, because of indestructibility; practice the sympathy of purity, because of the essential purity of the dharmas;  Teisho If we don’t drink water and breathe, we can’t live. In the same way that a baby needs to breast feed to stay alive, these are our instincts, they are necessary. But if we get attached to them, overly attached to them and caught on them, they become desires, and when we can’t have what we think we need, we react. We get stuck on that reaction, we get angry, and the behavior that we manifest when we’re angry is ignorant. It happens to us without our even knowing it. And then we end up with greed and anger and ignorance. While these instincts are necessary for us to live, when we get overly desirous of anything, then we get confused and we make problems for people around us.\nIt is the arhat who has purified these instincts, not turning them into desires or anger and ignorance. The Buddha did the training of the arhat when he was on Dantokusan Mountain. For six years he purified. When those instincts were settled by doing this, from there came his deepest compassion. Our personal desires and opinions have to be let go of, and then we are greatly, spontaneously, compassionate. This is the way that Vimalakirti says it.\n Sutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of no extremes, because of its being like space; practice the sympathy of an arhat, because of the destruction of the “bandits” of the fetters;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of a bodhisattva, because of the pacification of sentient beings; practice the sympathy of a Tathāgata, because of attainment of the characteristic of “thusness”;\n“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of a buddha, because of the enlightenment of sentient beings; practice the sympathy of the naturally [accomplished sage], because of the imperceptibility of causes;\n Teisho Greed, anger and ignorance are not piled up anywhere for an arhat, and this brings forth their deep compassion. Just being near someone in this state of mind quiets our mind; going near a bodhisattva, for example. The Tathagata or one who has lost all of those caught places is, as Hakuin Zenji has written it, one who is “realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be anyplace else. Realizing the thought of no thought as thought, singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.” Or, as it was said, “You have come with no coming and you leave with no leaving,” naturally coming, naturally going.\nMaster Ryokan has said,\nThe flower blooms empty-mindedly, And the butterfly comes to the flower empty-mindedly.\nWhen the flower blooms, the butterfly comes; the butterfly comes when the flower is blooming. Neither has planned this. In a natural way it works like this with no expectation on either’s part–simply things exactly as they are. This is how the Tathagata is and compassion is, not producing something special or something particular.\nFor visiting someone who is sick, to visit them in a natural way, not making any big deal about it but going to visit, entering naturally, speaking to them, enjoying being together with them for that moment, and leaving in a regular way. To not give unnecessary words to someone who is sick, but just to enjoy seeing them and being together. To forget the sickness for a short time, this is true compassion. To not plan and push, yet to open someone’s mind with even a few right words, this is the Way of the Tathagata–nothing special, but to forget being sick even for a moment. This is compassion.\n Sutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of bodhi, because of the sameness of the single taste;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of inequivalence, because of the eradication of the affections;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of great compassion, because of guiding [sentient beings] by means of the Mahayana;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonrevulsion, because of the contemplation of emptiness and no-self;  Teisho Vimalakirti continues. The Buddha’s compassion comes naturally because from the origin what we all are is compassionate, naturally wanting to give something. This is the truest compassion. It’s not about having some special idea or intention involved with that giving. This is something anybody would understand when it is manifested in its truest way; it’s not some special kind of manifestation or something which we have a personal opinion about, but something anyone could easily and openly be and receive. This true compassion is something we all have. It resembles wanting to give something from an egoistic expectation and intention, and maybe this is not a bad thing, but to spontaneously give without any agenda is the natural compassion. They look similar but they are not the same; it is about whether the ego is involved or not involved. The word “compassion” is one kanji, but as used here it has two parts. One part of the ideograph of “compassion” means “to take away pain” and the other half means “to give wisdom.” Both are parts of true great compassion.\nThis great compassion is like the Mahayana–a huge cart that carries everyone. This is how the Mahayana teaching is described: a huge cart on which everyone can ride. We can really entrust to the Mahayana. As for the mind of great compassion, we can have deep trust in it as well.\nSutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonrevulsion, because of the contemplation of emptiness and no-self;  Teisho When love is new, people make great efforts to continue. But as people get used to it, they get bored. It loses its freshness. In true great compassion there is never anything like that. It is fresh, it is never exhausted, it is not something special. Because it is from essence we can know this total letting go to it. This is the way of great compassion.\nSix paramitas Next, the six paramitas are given as ways of great compassion.\n Sutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the charity of Dharma, because of the absence of regrets;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of morality, because of converting the transgressors; practice the sympathy of forbearance, because of protecting others and self;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of exertion, because of carrying the burden for sentient beings;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of concentration, because of not experiencing the flavors [of desire];“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of wisdom, because of the absence of any time of non-understanding;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of skillful means, because of the manifestation of all [teaching methods];  Teisho The ways of great compassion are usually spoken of as charity in things, but here it is saying that it is a giving not of things but of Dharma. Without any resentment it also aligns us with the way of being with the ten severe precepts: to not kill life, to not steal, to not tell untruths, to not be unclear in relationships, to not be intoxicated. No matter what happens, to not be moved around by anything but to drink it all down, because this is also compassion. And that requires us to work on purifying and clarifying our mind.\nThe way of tolerance–to smile no matter what comes along–this is compassion. To do twice as much as others in making efforts so people can see what that looks like. And to not be confused and upset by what we see and hear–this is samadhi. In doing things there is a timing, and without that direct application of compassion it is hard to become one and melt together with another. We also have to be serene, or we can’t know what another person really needs at any given moment. Yet this compassion is still not something special, says Vimalakirti.\n Sutra “‘[I should] practice the sympathy of non-hiding, because of the purity of sincerity;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the profound mind, because of the absence of heterogeneous practices;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the non-crazed, because of not using false conventions;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of peace and joy, because of causing [beings] to attain the joy of buddhahood—thus is the sympathy of the bodhisattva.’”  Teisho Next Vimalakirti talks about the liberative technique. For this we need the particular wisdom of any given moment. Putting in fresh flowers, massaging someone’s feet, not only doing what the person says they want us to, but to intuit exactly what they need the most, and with no secrets or being bothered by anything that happens there. This is truly compassion. It is not about something which is only being given in the name of the Buddha, but which is intuitively possible to be seen as what that person needs in any moment and situation. It takes serenity to see what this is.\nIf someone is sick for a long time their mind can become heavy and also scattered. To not meet them with that same state of mind, but using clarity to be secure and steady and support their life energy. To support their deepest security, not in the usual sense of worldly security but as the deep trust in the Buddha’s words and ways. And in each word the Mind’s profound depth is manifested. This deep inner security is what is great compassion, that compassion of no limits, infinite, without any boundaries at all. This is what is important.\nFinally the Four Immeasurable Treasures are brought in here as ways of great compassion. These were discussed in the Buddha land building section of this sutra. This is when one realizes compassion and it gets passed along, widening exponentially, infinitely.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked further, “What is compassion?”  Vimalakīrti answered, “The merits achieved by the bodhisattva are entirely shared with all sentient beings.”  Teisho As you heard before, the word for compassion has two parts. The first is to liberate the person from pain and the second is to therein bring joy and wisdom. Taking away the pain, the mind can then become quiet and joy and wisdom become possible. Then that quiet mind spread to everyone else it encounters, exponentially.  Sutra Mañjuśrī: “What is joy?”\nVimalakīrti: “If there is benefit, then one rejoices without regret.”\nMañjuśrī: “What is forsaking?”\nVimalakīrti: “The blessings generated are without expectation.”\n Teisho It can be very lonely and scary to be sick. We can hear things and feel emotions that are not familiar and are not relevant to our surroundings and our sense of our situation. To become one with the other to take away their pain, having someone by your side when you’ve a bad dream, someone who can wake you up and say, “Hey! That’s a bad dream!” In doing this we can then feel what is benefiting both self and other, right there. To take away any kind of fear and pain. Finally they’re able to throw away everything to realize the Four Immeasurable Treasures themselves. And that is done with an infinite expansion of mind.\nThat sickness which Vimalakirti has been teaching about from the outset is only phenomena. We have to compassionately tell a person just that, awaken them to that. And from the understanding of that, great love is brought forth. This is endless and eternal compassion. To awaken to that is the wisdom of the Buddha. To realize that this is what true compassion is, is what Vimalakirti is teaching.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “For the bodhisattva who fears samsara, what should be his reliance?”  Vimalakīrti said, “A bodhisattva who fears samsara should rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit.”  Teisho Vimalakirti is telling us not to be deceived by others’ pain, not to be deceived by the phenomena of sickness or we will lose our true wisdom. In our truest root there is no sickness; from the origin there is no form, there is no shape. This is why it is named “Buddha nature” for want of a better terminology. Vimalakirti continues, saying that compassion is not something that arises relative to another’s suffering; it is something that is there from the origin. Compassion is huge and equal for each and every person and circumstance.\nWhen we are like this it immediately becomes clear of itself. To recognize this beyond fear of it, though, this is what is satori. And Manjusri then asks what to do to help those to see this, and the answer is that right in the middle of the fuss of society he should stand to see where the mind should take refuge.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit—in what should he abide?”\nVimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit should abide in saving all sentient beings.”\n Teisho Things are always in flux in every instant, so in what should we take our refuge? It used to be that individuals had small businesses, but now it is big businesses which use a small company here and there as a small part of a larger process, a larger whole. Often these smaller businesses don’t even know what the whole process is and what part of a whole they actually are. These ways of developing things put people into very uncomfortable situations. Today we have this problem across the board in many different areas–looking at health insurance, for example. In a world like this, people are losing jobs and employment everywhere and expressing their insecurity with violence and bombings, in the contagious way uprisings spread. Weak people commit suicide. People don’t know what to do, where to turn. This kind of dis-ease has become common. People are clueless about how they can possibly repair it, and where to go from here.\nSo where can refuge be found?\n Sutra Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit should abide in saving all sentient beings.”  Teisho This is what Vimalakirti says: Bodhisattvas are those who have resolved their desires, and even if society does provide, they rely on their own inner resources. This world is a borrowed reality. This is what the bodhisattvas know. And if we don’t see it that way we will stay confused. There are many who hold to a god or a buddha as being responsible or offering a solution. But many found out that this is no reality that we can depend upon. Where can we find this reality in our mind?  Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “If one wishes to save sentient beings, what should be eradicated?”  Vimalakīrti: “If one wishes to save sentient beings, the afflictions should be eradicated.”  Teisho  What variety of mind should be upheld, Manjusri is asking. Vimalakirti is saying that we must not be deceived and not be hanging on and not be indulgent in our investigation of what we should be realizing for liberating all beings, but rather, we have to stand firmly on the vow and the deep commitment to do that liberating. It has to be done in a way where our confusing small self, our old self, is thrown away completely and we dive right into the Buddha. If we hold onto a small self in any way and want to save ourselves first, this won’t work. We have to throw ourself away completely. If we hold onto our ego–our “I,” “me,” “mine”–we will carry around a dualistic view even into our zazen and will always be in a feverish state of mind, and we will not know how we can go forward. It will be as if we had poked a mad bees’ nest. We don’t sit to carry on our noisy inner confusion of mind, we sit to throw all of that away completely. The Buddha then appears, and this mind which is in what the Buddha appears, that becomes our body. We sit as if it is the Buddha sitting. This kind of zazen is our central fulcrum. If we carry our small self into this we will without fail hit a wall. To throw ourself away completely, that is unconditional; it has to be done totally. We use susokkan as the tool to throw ourself away.\nThis is not about trying to become a something. It is about letting go of everything. We will then naturally realize this place where we can see and know the truth deeply. And this is not about sitting for ourself; this has to be seen clearly or zazen also becomes something which deceives us. We have to throw away our old version of small self. Dive into our zazen and vow to give up everything for the liberating of others—giving everything to our zazen! For people who chant the Buddha’s name it is the chanting which calls out to waken the deepest vow and true commitment.\nVimalakirti is saying this: “Become the Buddha! Throw your small self away completely! Become that truth of Buddha’s deep faith and trust and decision and commitment to awakening everyone no matter what, going beyond your old small self’s narrow conditioning!” This brings forth great motivation, and we change in a way that enables us to know how to do this liberation. And in the knowing of that our mind settles.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “If one wishes to eradicate the afflictions, what should one practice?”\nVimalakīrti: “One should practice correct mindfulness.”\n Teisho So Manjusri, being told to dive into becoming a Buddha, asks, how do we do that? Is it really so easy to throw ourselves away? And to this Vimalakirti answers that he should liberate beings from their passions. We can’t hold on to wanting to go out and play, wear nice clothes, do what we feel like. We have to let go of all of our attachments to those things.\nBeing told this, Manjusri continues, how should one who wishes to eliminate passions apply themselves? And Vimalakirti replies that they should apply themselves appropriately. It’s not easy to throw away all those desires. “I want this.” “I want to do that.” “I want it to go like this.” It’s not so easy to throw all of that away. How can that be done? If we want to settle our insecure mind like that we will fall over under the weight of such a heavy vow and commitment. But Vimalakirti has answered, apply yourself appropriately. “Appropriately” means having continuous, clear, correct mind moments. This “correct” is not a relative correct. This “correct,” which is also the word “mu,” is not “correct” relative to “mistaken.” It is “correct” as in “one straight line.” If we don’t decide and become that one straight line, we get pushed over by our impurities within, endlessly. Those thoughts, all helter-skelter, do not settle. But we have to decide to transform those helter-skelter mind moments in one fell swoop, a decided moment, in one straight line. And doing that, letting go of all thinking that we even have let go of all of our thinking–that is when it becomes truly one straight line. It becomes ongoing clear mind moments then.\nTo become this one straight line of life energy we have to become completely that life energy–this state of mind of while having desires to not be moved around by them. Shoju Rojin, whose name was also Dokyo Etan Zenji, was the master of Master Hakuin. Hakuin teaches that we should always continue in clear mind moments. But his teacher also said that almost no one could do it. Dokyo Etan Zenji said, “I am almost 70 years old and it has taken me 40 years!\n Sutra ”Mañjuśrī asked, “How does one practice correct mindfulness?”\nVimalakīrti: “One should practice nongeneration and nonextinction.”\n Teisho There are different ways of doing this. In the Jodo Sect there is the practice of chanting the Buddha’s name. In Christianity we have praying without ceasing. For all of these it is about not piling up unnecessary thinking in our mind, but rather to be present in this very moment completely. To not have any unnecessary decoration—it’s that with which we crush ourselves. In this cold weather, to have just enough clothing, just enough food, to return to our true life energy and mind.\nIn Zen we become the decision to liberate all beings no matter what. In this way, whether in our job or whether in our home life, it is a matter of becoming that job and that home life totally and completely. Whatever it is we are doing, whether it’s sitting in the zendo, eating, doing samu, we don’t invite in any extra thinking. It has to be in this way where everything else is put aside and we aren’t having any extraneous thoughts.\nThe same way is true for a singer. When a top rate singer is singing she’s not letting in a lot of extra thoughts about what she’s doing and how it’s going or other things in her life. Or a first rate athlete who has to let go of all of that thinking while playing his sport—eventually he’s not even thinking that he’s not letting in that thinking, he’s only becoming that ball. The athlete becomes that ball completely; without it being like that he cannot play well. This is true for all of us in everything we do. This is the world of becoming oneness completely.\nBankei Zenji Bankei Zenji lived 300 years ago. He was the one we’ve been hearing about who was always teaching about the Unborn Mind. He wrote a poem:\nThe old barrel, The bottom falls out. In all the three worlds there is nothing left, Not even one band of iron.\nPeople don’t use such wooden barrels so much anymore. They used to use them for storing wine, for example, or for storing other things. If we saw them we could see that they would be tied at the top with a paper string or a metal string so the thing inside them wouldn’t spoil.\nWhen a barrel got old and leaked, new barrels would be made when necessary. But often you could see old, unused, finished barrels left here and there, gathering rain, dead leaves, small animal poop. And all of that together would eventually start bubbling and create methane gas, just like our mind and our stored-up thinking does. All that grumbling, all that dissatisfaction, that methane gas bubbling. We all gather stuff like that. And if we keep it bottled up, then we come to a place where it bursts out. We have to keep our practice going in such a way that we let go of that and continue with these ongoing clear mind moments. As we continue that in one straight line we come to a moment when the bottom of the barrel bursts out completely and the stave boards, the sides of the barrel, fall out and the barrel’s rings are all that is left. This bottom that falls out is like our ego. That ego makes everything difficult. Drop that ego like the bottom falling out of the barrel! Then we can know how our true state of mind actually is. But we have to sit completely and totally becoming it to do this. We can be sitting with the chanting of the Buddha’s name until we lose track of the zendo, the heavens and earth, and then all of our insecurities will be gone. This is the fulcrum of the liberation of all beings. There is no trick. It is only that it has to be done until that bottom falls out completely, and that is possible with the ki energy and the continuous mind moments that go with doing it in one straight line. This is how we realize its deep truth.\nWe are not all such high quality people of training here perhaps, but we have to continue until that bottom falls out completely. Nevertheless, whether we can do it or not we have to continue because this is what we know we have to do. We may want to have it go quickly but it may take a longer time. We can’t suddenly decide we want to give up, we just have to continue. We have to continue and do it to whatever degree we possibly can.\nThe bodhisattvas who are still insecure about life and death are asking how should they resolve their insecure mind. Manjusri asks Vimalakirti this question on behalf of all these insecure bodhisattvas. He has already seen these points himself—Manjusri has—but he’s asking on our behalf, for the doubts in our minds, to have Vimalakirti say these answers for everyone. Manjusri Bodhisattva already knows very well, but those bodhisattvas who want to work in society need to know this. We need to know how to not be insecure about life and death, having this dualistic view of birth and death, good and bad, gain and loss, profitable and unprofitable, these wisps of dualism that still are always flickering through our minds because our absolute core is not yet clearly established. We still get pulled around by things and places. How to let go of that is what is being asked about here, and to this Vimalakirti says that a bodhisattva should stand on the inner magnanimity and equanimity of the Buddha in the midst of any and all turbulence.\nSo many times we become confused by many different opinions about things and about people–other people’s judgments about stuff. We have to work with this or finally we can end up losing track of who we should be listening to. Vimalakirti saw this question, and since it is about bodhisattvas asking it, he answered it by talking about that deep, deep vow–the power of the vow, the Dharma body and the Wisdom body.\nThe Wisdom body is Amida Nyorai, who represents all good and all evil beings being liberated, without any exception. The power of this vow to liberate all, both good and bad, is called Amida Nyorai. Not with all of these thoughts swinging us around, but by calling forth the great vow power within can we do this. Not scattering it, but gathering it: this cannot be done with concepts because our mind and inner awareness only become diluted and superficial with concepts. That is what makes us insecure. As Bodhidharma said, to let go of all connections to anything whatsoever that is external, and within, to let go of any concerns. When we can be like that, we are like a firm, tall, wall and at one with the Way. To not be pulled around by what is external at all, or by whether we can do it or can’t do it, or by those myriad thoughts that are always being born. Instead, to bring our mind into focus, gather our strong vow power into oneness, and then it becomes strong ki energy.\nAs the roshi often says when he is teaching zazen, the breathing is like blowing up a balloon and not giving any attention to anything else external. To exhale completely in each breath to the very, very end of our exhalation, not by forcing, not by pushing too hard. It’s not about trying to force something to happen, but in the natural way, to see clearly, to look at it carefully. And being relaxed in the top half of our body we are then centered in the lower part of our body. With our focus in our abdomen we exhale completely, then we inhale naturally. Without allowing any gaps between the inhalation and exhalation and the next inhalation and exhalation, we continue and always exhale to the very end of the breath. We do this continually and we become full and taut with energy. To the very tips of our hair pores we can feel this energy. This full tautness is what more and more will relieve our difficult places, and we become full of motivated energy.\nBut you really have to do this like a fool, to just do it and nothing else. Doing this with no gaps, then we can find that deep inner energy within that brings it forth. Our motivation continues, and strong ki energy is building. This is how it has to be done; Vimalakirti is teaching the bodhisattvas what they have to do, telling them to bring forth Nyorai’s great vow power from within, that this is the fulcrum of how to resolve their insecurity.\nThoughts still come but we put aside our own good fortune and focus, for all people’s liberation, on letting go of all those attached desires. More and more we let go and we see that the thinking is only a habit. So we replace that habit with a new habit of thinking of nothing at all, only focusing on right now, right here, right in front of our face—only on this place of right here and this time of right now. Our energy becomes strong and clear, and then we are able to, in anything we encounter, become it. If it’s our zazen we become totally that zazen. If it’s our working, we become totally, completely at one with our working. If it’s eating, we become totally that eating. And doing this we become huge and we become a settled state of mind. It is nothing to become confused about, really. Only to focus within.\nVimalakirti is talking about the samadhi of going in one straight line. People who are chanting the Buddha’s name, Namu Amida Butsu, do that for their whole lifetime. They will continue that as their way to enter samadhi in one straight line. Or Namu Myo Renge Kyo, chanting that always, and keeping that what is foremost in their focus. In the way of Zen, people do zazen. But if we only do it as a form and not in essence, if we only do it in the zendo and not all the time, then when we leave the zendo it is no longer true samadhi. We have to be able to have continuous clear mind moments, to have this twenty-four hours a day in fact, not just twenty minutes a day of zazen here. Then we realize that functioning is the manifesting of that one straight line, and that is how we can keep it going all day long. That is zazen in action.\nIf we are always clear in mind, our mind is not moved around, whether it’s here or there or we’re in this situation or that situation. We must be clear and settled for this, however, and always be in a state of mind that is like freely running water. As the patriarch Manura Sonja said, “The mind is truly mysterious. Its way is miraculously subtle. If you follow its flow and can perceive its nature, you’ll be stuck on neither joy nor sorrow.” While the mind continually sees and hears, it holds on to nothing at all.\nWe are so often deceived by what is external and mistakenly get pulled off our inner center. With that we will not know the true and accurate perception of pain or sorrow or joy and truth. We won’t be able to know why we are doing zazen. To not have our mind pulled around by what is outside of us. Instead, be like a mirror that holds onto nothing that comes into it whatsoever. It only reflects exactly what’s coming: That is the straightforward mind that was written about earlier. But for this we have to have a truthful and clear mind.\nThe state of mind when people are just beginning to sit and that state of mind of those who have sat for a long time are naturally quite different. At the beginning our mind resists and roams, but as we continue we see that the pain is a matter of course, and we know that it won’t be damaging; this comes from our experience of it. Our breath at the very beginning is very hard to find and feel clearly and decisively, but as we sit it becomes clear and regular. Training our mind is like training a dog in this: a little wild in the beginning, it gradually becomes obedient. It stops poking around in every garbage can that it encounters. It starts following its owner around more easily. And there doesn’t need to be some kind of leash around its neck all the time; it’s no longer concerned about unnecessary things. But we have to sit to this point. In the beginning no one can do it immediately, even if they pretend to. But bit by bit we continue, and then it all settles.\nOur zazen becomes the state of mind that is not stopped and is not stopping thinking, either. This is a frequent misunderstanding. It’s about not being caught on any thoughts. It is not like being a tightrope walker who only concentrates and balances when they are on a high rope. Our zazen has to be able to kick in all the time. It’s not that thoughts are bad; it’s only that we continually follow them around like a broken tape loop. So instead we say, OK, I’m not going to think at all. This is like when the electricity goes off suddenly; that has no purpose, either. Rather, as Master Rinzai says, when we perceive something directly, to not add on any thoughts to that perception; no associations and no second ideas.\nTo only directly perceive without second or third thoughts added. This will have more value for our practice than thirteen years of pilgrimage. This awareness is a flowing dynamic. If it does not flow it gets stagnant, and then it is truly like a broken tape recorder, and our mind just repeats and repeats the same thing over and over again. It cannot be like that. Our zazen must be fluid and useful in every part of our life. It’s not a separate life of zazen only on the cushion. We have to experience the true state of mind to be able to be without thoughts that we don’t need. If we have a goal or a need for thinking, then there is no problem with using thoughts. But when we are using them, to use them directly, with our direct perceptions, in our intuitive way, with our intuitive perceptions. Doing this is very simple: “This is a flower.” “A bird is singing.” “Rain is falling;” adding on nothing else. To cultivate this direct perception is zazen. It’s not about trying to stop thoughts. To cultivate this direct perception is a healthy state of mind.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?”\nVimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”\n Teisho Our awareness cannot be described by any word because it has no form. As Master Rinzai has said, our true mind has no form, yet it extends in all ten directions. Throughout the universe, it permeates everywhere. Hearing this we think there is something special permeating; it is very far from this. It is not that there is something special. It is our directly perceiving mind: a flower, a mountain, a river–all the 100,000 things. Through the five windows of our senses we perceive these. Our awareness flows in and out. There are no words that can be used to explain our awareness. If in our mind we have ideas, we cannot make use of our abilities and capabilities because, stuck on an idea about them, they cannot flow. Not to be stuck on an idea of something special or a particular idea of how things should work. Without those stuck ideas we can extend freely in all ten directions and respond always in the appropriate way.\nThe base of our awareness is to not hold onto anything at all because nothing at all is truly how it is. We see the mountains and the mountains are in our awareness. This is our healthy awareness. But our weak place is that our mirror reflects unnecessary things. Without that, we perceive directly and clearly. As the roshi always says to his students, after osesshin, to stay in nature for a few days and not get scattered. Perceive clearly the nature of clear mind while it is clarified awareness after osesshin, and not to go scattering our attention and focus externally.\nThe actual important time of osesshin is in fact right after the osesshin when we experience how truthful our perception is. We also can’t be caught on that, though, or on our experiences. The things that we have experienced become preconceived notions. To not hold on to past experiences, especially in human relationships. To look at this carefully and align our way of being and mind. We all have this true base of mind from the origin; we all have received this. There is nothing more wonderful than this truth.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?”\nVimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”\n Teisho The Sixth Patriarch has addressed this same question by saying that anything that is externally perceived, to not add on thoughts of good and bad to it, and anything that is within, to not be caught by it. To this very point the Sixth Patriarch has said it so kindly. That mirror—that mirror in which there is nothing at all, yet that activity of mind is functioning—that is what he is speaking of. While there’s nothing in that mirror at all, this activity of mind extends throughout the universe. This is without any birth or death, open, totally open, completely open. This is the true mind moment. To return to that!\nAnd to this Manjusri adds–purposely dividing them–What is not produced? What is not destroyed? Vimalakirti answers that evil is not produced and good is not destroyed. This means to not deceive our true mind. Because we don’t trust our own direct perception, we start inventing other thoughts and dualistic perception. To not do that. To not do that inventing is good. To hold on to what we invent—that is not our direct, true perception. That is what is referred to as evil. But because what comes forth of its own has no birth or death, it is not actual. And neither is that which we produce; that is not actual either. Neither of those are actual, and therefore our true nature remains as being nothing at all.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of good and bad dharmas?” Vimalakīrti: “The body is their fundamental basis.”  Teisho In fact, good and bad are nothing in actuality. They are only produced phenomena. This is why next, Manjusri asks what is the root of good and evil, and Vimalakirti answers, “Materiality is the root of good and evil.” Because we have a body—that is what materiality means here—that is to say, because we are alive, we divide into good and evil. With just a physical body there is no seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling. But here, “body” means because we are alive. So because there is a body, because we are alive, there is good and bad.  Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of the body?”\nVimalakīrti: “Desire is its fundamental basis.”\n Teisho Manjusri continues questioning Vimalakirti to the very last, ultimate point; he doesn’t stop.\nSo what is the source of that body? “Desire is the root of materiality.” To exist is to have those three activities: greed, anger, and ignorance. Blood circulates through our physical body, carrying oxygen and nutrition to our trillions of cells and making possible the strong, energetic activity of our body. If we are missing something we will naturally get a sign from our body: “Need air.” “Need water.” “Need food.” In our body these are instinctual needs. (These are usually divided into the titles, Greed, Anger and Ignorance, but here it is only written as desire.) Because of these we have our basic greediness. But these are not bad things; they are for staying alive. From these desires our thoughts arise and are born because we get insecure because of what we need. Then we start wanting more than we need, and the instinctual desires become more than we need; the instinctual desires become greedy desires. This is how we all work, and if we aren’t aware of it we’ll be moving around blindly. We are all confused constantly by our extreme desires beyond necessity. To see this clearly we have to do correct zazen or our confusion will be ever greater. In this way Vimalakirti is meticulously teaching us.\nThe essential part of this section of the Vimalakirti Sutra is now being looked at.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “How does one practice correct mindfulness?”\nVimalakīrti: “One should practice nongeneration and nonextinction.”\nMañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?”\nVimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”\n Teisho To relieve anxiety, continuous, clear mind moments are most important. The Sixth Patriarch puts it that the most central marrow of the lineage is to be without any mind moments being polluted, without any form in our mind, no sense of a small self, and to always be flowing like clear water, never located and fixed in a stagnant way in any certain place. The Buddha realized the truth which has always existed as an inner truth and outer truth, the outer truth being the sciences and laws that are true for any culture at any time, such as one plus one equals two or that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen; these outer laws are true anywhere and clearly are unchanging. The inner laws are those such as Master Rinzai has said: “The Dharma has no form yet it extends in all ten directions.” No human is exempt from these inner laws either.\nAnanda, the disciple of the Buddha, asked the Buddha what the disciples should do when the Buddha died, and the Buddha said, “Be a lamp unto yourselves. Look to and take refuge in the Dharma. Do not look externally and do not look to others.” The Buddha used many means and taught the actuality of the mind his whole life. “Take refuge in the Dharma,” he said. To take refuge within, not to look for light externally and not to look for the light in others.\nThough even twins have different personalities and all people have different appearances and different characters, they are actually nevertheless all of that same mind that has no form. That mind has no form. While the ego has many opinions and ideas and stances which are as different as human beings’ characters, there is also a mind which precedes this individualized ego. And this mind is something that is the same in all beings and is the source of all; this is what the Buddha called Dharma. It is only one. Our mental activity changes according to the person, but the source is the same for each and every person.\nThe Sixth Patriarch was the sixth ancient in the line which was started with Bodhidharma. The Buddha’s teaching is given here throughout the passing on of the transmission from ancient to ancient. All of them were awakened to the one and same truth. Kasho, Ananda, throughout the patriarchs —in this mind not a single thought is needed. Not a single thought is held onto. This is the truth. If we think of something, ego arises, but if we are not thinking about anything, not even a mind moment arises. This is where we all are exactly the same.\nThe mind’s true base is without any form. For mind to be stopped nowhere, for us to be not located but flowing in mind, is our healthiest way of being. This actuality is what Vimalakirti is using in what he is teaching here. To think of nothing at all is our true mind, or else we are all separated. Before that, prior to that, it is one true mind. True mind is empty-mindedness. If we only think about it then we can’t see it clearly.\nBut empty-mindedness is not to think about thinking of nothing at all. It is to not think about unnecessary things. We think so many unnecessary things we no longer can tell the difference; we can’t see what we need to think and what we don’t need to think. It is healthy when we are only having thoughts arise when they are needed. But if during zazen, for example, we are always concerned with things that happened in the past and things that might happen in the future, it makes us scattered. This is not clarity of mind.\nWe meet people and then seeing their face we may suddenly think of the past when we’d known them or had some experience with them. And we have many memories. This is common and this can become difficult, especially, for example, if it’s with family and relatives. If we are not reserved and clear in our state of mind it can become very, very difficult. We easily have a habit of just making up and thinking lots of indulgent thoughts. But it is very important to see that necessary thinking, when it’s no longer needed, is gone. This is what clear mind is like.\nTo have only the thoughts we need. When we are working, for example, the data, the other information we need, we use. We use it easily and without being attached to it it goes very simply. Beginners, of course, when they’re learning to do something need lots of information to do the job, but that is just one step where they need all that information. It is not always going to be needed to be held onto to do the job. So we can speak without being caught on the fact that we are even speaking. We can think without being caught on the fact that we are thinking. The problem is that we have so many thoughts we don’t need, and we don’t align that. As the Sixth Patriarch said, our living truth is to be caught on no thought. Having them but to not be attached to them.\nSecond in our lineage’s truth is this mind of no small self: There is no mind of form. We are not needing to always be thinking in terms of an “I” or a “me.” From morning we wash our clothes, we clean, we cook, but our most effective work is done when we are not hanging onto thoughts about a “myself.” We clean but we don’t keep thinking about cleaning when we finish our cleaning. Problems arise when we are thinking about things when we have already finished them. We have to let go of our old, conditioned thinking, to always be in a new and regenerating state of mind. This is our newly aligned mind, this place of no mind moments to be polluted, no caught form or small “I,” a mind which is always flowing like clear water, never fixed at a location or stagnant. And these are what Vimalakirti is talking about here and making clear.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?”\nVimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”\n Teisho As the Heart Sutra teaches, we must go beyond mental understanding. If we limit training to be only mental understanding, it has no effect on our actual life. Just as we can’t do sports or play violin by knowing and thinking about how things are done, instead we have to practice and experience. We learn by experiencing and doing. If we are just thinking about doing things then we ‘relate’ only to thoughts and we don’t develop. We have to forget our body, our thoughts, forget ourself completely, and not get caught on our fixed awareness of being a body. Then we can directly perceive this reality.\nWhen we forget our body, then we can actually walk the experience of realizing our true original nature directly. That is why this osesshin participation is so important: to touch one’s own true Mind directly. You cannot imagine how essential this is. Even for people like those here who are usually working in society, to be able to come here and throw ourselves away and be absorbed into true clear Mind–this is so important! Deeper prajna wisdom only works, only comes forth from deep experience. Even if not able to do this all at once, we dig in and we continue until we can realize that experience of the deepest true Mind directly!\nWe have a body and it is our instinct to protect it. We have to let go of all of that; if we can realize that we will not need to be taught. We will know ourselves, from what we have realized, exactly what we have to do. That is why this experience and the Buddha’s teaching from what he learned when he was on Dantokusan Mountain is so important–so we can also clarify this and realize our deepest mind directly. Until the Buddha, no one who had experienced this had in the same way so openly shared it. Even the Buddha had thought that no one would possibly believe him. But he creatively worked on it from every angle and then for his whole entire life, he taught.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?”\nVimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”\nMañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of good and bad dharmas?” Vimalakīrti: “The body is their fundamental basis.”\n Teisho It says in the Heart Sutra, there is no birth, no death, no increase, no decrease, no purity and nothing impure. This is not meaning that behind this emptiness is a something that is a bad something or a good something, only that relative to realizing the true nature, something can be looked at as good or bad. This something is not the realizing of the true nature, something which is only a reflection. We hear a birdsong and it is simply and directly perceived. But if we add a naming and we add an opinion, it is no longer direct and there is extra added thinking to it; that is not the point when it comes to realizing our true nature directly.\nAwareness and experience are only things that we imagine exist. But the clear mind is right there in them all the time and they all act together. That which arises from thinking is not actual, so anything that is thought of as good or bad is not of our true original Mind. If we see sickness as well, that is not the actuality of our true nature, and we should not be caught on it. Only our eyes, just as they see, our ears, just as they hear. And what is the source of that? The source of that is that we have a body and there are five senses there. This is what he is talking about when he says “The body is their fundamental basis.”\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of the body?”\nVimalakīrti: “Desire is its fundamental basis.”\n Teisho Because there is desire and it gets extreme, everyone has greed, anger and ignorance. But these instincts themselves before they become extreme are not something bad; we need them for our body to live. But our body is something that dies; we only need these instincts for when our body is alive. If these instincts become extreme, that is when they become greed, anger and ignorance.  Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of desire?”\nVimalakīrti: “False discrimination is its fundamental basis.”\nMañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of false discrimination?” Vimalakīrti: “Confused conception is its fundamental basis.”   Teisho The blinding instincts which arise only of their own, these unreal constructions–these are the roots of desire. As Master Dogen Zenji said, all humans are born as animal instincts only, and have to be trained or we will always be continuously moved around by our desires. What is their source? Their source is that ongoing, untethered, central-placed “I.” Here Vimalakirti says, “Unreal construction is the root of desire,” to which Manjusri then presses, “What is the root of unreal construction?” We see everything as if it is centered around “me,” “my.”\nThere are billions of human beings on this globe, and if each and every one of them only thinks of themselves we will be crushed immediately and the world and its ecology will be destroyed. Because we are all seeing from an unreal construction we see from a view where we are always–always–thinking of our own greatest personal benefit, making our personal benefit what is most important. That brings the four upside down views.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of false discrimination?”\nVimalakīrti: “Confused conception is its fundamental basis.”\n Teisho This baselessness is the main point here. As the Sixth Patriarch has said, our sect’s most central point is that we have no mind moments to be polluted; that there is no “I,” no form in our mind and that we are always flowing like clear water. This mind is not stagnant or fixed in location but rather, as Master Hakuin has said in his Song of Zazen, “All sentient beings are essentially Buddhas. Like water and ice, there is no ice without water; apart from sentient beings there are no buddhas.” In this way our universe is said to be made of molecules and atoms which are always expressing through changes in their form. This is like that water. But if we get caught on being our small self version with its narrow view, it all becomes like ice and does not flow. If it flows there is no such thing as a “good” and “bad” because it’s always transforming from one to the other naturally as it flows, and it is not fixed into an egoistic view such as “This is good” and “This is bad.” Flowing mind cannot hold an ego view because it is always flowing and changing. That is why it is always new and fresh and new and fresh and new and fresh; that is our true nature.\nWhile it is our true nature and we know that, in our life it is not so simple to be that way. We can’t so simply say, “There’s no good and bad.” We see where someone is spreading pain and suffering everywhere. People don’t always do good things or always do bad things, and someone who does bad things may also be a great parent. We can’t label this. But if there is no flow it is bad and becomes more and more bad as the toxins build up. Neither can we be caught on “This is beautiful” and “That is good and pretty,” nor is that which is bad and hard to look at something we should be caught on. We have to look carefully at this and see how it is all really working. Even if we are able to attain something we love very much, that can also make us caught on something. Not to be caught on what is good and not to be caught on what is evil: This is what Vimalakirti is finally saying.\n Sutra Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of confused conception?” Vimalakīrti: “The nonabiding is its fundamental basis.”\nMañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of nonabiding?”\nVimalakīrti: “Nonabiding is without any fundamental basis. All dharmas are established on the fundamental basis of nonabiding.”\n Teisho All things, whether sickness or crisis or not, never stay forever because all of it is phenomena. Do what we have to do right now! That is how it has to be. To not say, “Oh, I’ll get to it later!” “Oh, I’ll get to it next time.” We lose that opportunity which is right now because it is phenomena, and phenomena all change. We know all things, all suffering, all good things all bad things, all change so we have to do it now when we have this opportunity. We all live in this flux of space and time. We cannot return to a particular moment. We don’t want to live in regrets, and that is why we have to hold each moment’s opportunity precious and see through every single last bit of phenomena. This is Buddhism’s most important place.\nAt the end of this exchange between Manjusri and Vimalakirti, a Goddess appeared:  Sutra  At the time, there was a goddess in Vimalakīrti’s room who, upon seeing the great men listening to the Dharma being explained, made herself visible and scattered heavenly flowers over the bodhisattvas and great disciples. When the flowers reached the bodhisattvas they all immediately fell off, but when they reached the great disciples they adhered and did not fall off. Even using all their numinous powers, the disciples were unable to remove the flowers.\n  At that time, the goddess asked Śāriputra, “Why would you remove the flowers?”\n  Śāriputra answered, “These flowers are contrary to the Dharma, so I would remove them.”\nThe goddess said, “Do not say that these flowers are contrary to the Dharma! Why? These flowers are without discrimination. Sir, it is you who are generating discriminative thoughts. If one who has left home in the Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is contrary to the Dharma; if such a one is without discrimination, this is in accord with the Dharma.\n Teisho The women from India, even today, offer flowers, chanting to the Buddha, Buddham Saranam Gacchami. But in this situation, some of the flowers stuck to the disciples who were ordained; they did not like them and tried to shake them off. The Goddess asked, why are you so unhappy with having these flowers sent down to you? To this Sariputra answered, “These are not natural flowers. This is not appropriate for an ordained person to have flowers pour down on them and have them stick to them.” But the Goddess said, “That is just your idea of what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. That is simply dualistic. This is just your own dualistic view of these flowers, how they should not be sticking to you because you are ordained. No matter what a good thing, if you are doing it or receiving it with a dualistic state of mind, it is no longer truly a good thing.” In Buddhism especially, there is reticence about be thanked for doing something because then people get caught on ideas of what is good and what is bad. And that divides human beings into good people and bad people, and that continues this perception that there is a dualistic thought that is correct. If we call someone a good person, then we also are also saying that there is a someone who is not good. People looking at Buddhism can get very confused, and in this way we may be increasing delusion rather than taking it away from them.\nWe get praised and we eagerly want to carry that around with us and think about it. Or we get put down and criticized and we can’t let go of the bad feeling—how it made us think that we’re someone terrible. We carry these thoughts around—thinking we are great because we are praised or terrible because we are corrected—and that becomes a very twisted state of mind. It is this kind of ongoing, dualistic chatter that is being referred to in this exchange between Sariputra and the Goddess. For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb the fearless. Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms—sounds, smells, tastes and textures—which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructed world. If there is, for example, any little thing in our mind, we get very sensitive. We get bothered. We get afraid. If a bamboo leaf even gently brushes against our neck we suddenly think that something is trying to get us and we get freaked out by it. Or we can even have a heart attack. We could easily have an accident if we are driving with a mind that is full of fear and afraid of what might happen next. So perturbed in our state of mind, we could cause an accident.\n“Look at the bodhisattvas, to whom the flowers do not adhere—this is because they have eradicated all discriminative thoughts.“For example, when a person is afraid, non-human [beings] are able to control him. Thus, since the disciples fear samsara, then forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles control you. None of the five desires can affect those who have transcended fear.“It is only because the latent influences [of your afflictions] are not yet exhausted that the flowers stick to your bodies.“For those in whom the latent influences are exhausted, the flowers do not stick.”\n Teisho Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instinct for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts. Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these Bodhisattvas who have abandoned all of their instincts. In the words of the last sutra of the Buddha, the Yuikyogyo Sutra, the Buddha said, if we don’t let go of all of the obscurations of our perceptions, then we make our originally clear mind, the source of our awareness, opaque and unclear. But we have a hard time knowing what is what. Going overboard, we become addicted, even to the extent of having some kind of continuing drug dependency, because we start by thinking, “Well, I will have just a little,” not knowing how much we are deceiving ourselves. This is why we have to be very attentive to how attached we are to things of the senses. When we do things too extremely, if we don’t align our perceptions then we easily can lose track of what it is that we are doing, how attached we are to our sense perceptions, and what clutter we bring to them. We have to see them all from their source. If we get caught, then it is our ego that comes into the picture. And that is what is going on in the room of Vimalakirti when the flowers are falling down and getting stuck on the disciples. Actually, that Goddess, she was a Bodhisattva. The Vimalakirti Sutra is in fact written for teaching people about the path of the Mahayana. People who are thinking in a small minded dualistic way, thinking of things for their own benefit, their own satisfaction, or their own liberation—the more we try to get our own personal liberation, if it is only for ourselves and our own small minded satisfaction, then that is a big problem. If our awakened mind is realized, then we will naturally want to do things for all beings, and our compassion will rise. We can’t do it without this point being well seen. The true Bodhisattvas forget themselves completely, even forget that they are a body, and they have no sense of being caught on what is painful or pleasurable and what is desirous because they are not caught on their own personal way of being. And so the flowers have nobody to even get stuck on.\nAs Master Rinzai says, “When we are perceiving something, to not add even a single notion or association onto what we perceive. If we practice this diligently then this is worth more than ten years of doing pilgrimage.” Do not add on any second thoughts or notions to what we perceive, rather to let go of all of those wisps of thoughts that are always coming along with those perceptions. To whatever we see, we don’t add on any thinking about it. To whatever we taste, we don’t add on any thinking to it. To whatever we hear, we don’t add on any thinking to it. But to just encounter those sense perceptions directly. To not get moved around by these wisps of thoughts that come in: for this we do zazen. And then, of course, although we have thoughts that are coming and going, we don’t get moved around by them. To let go of this is our deepest practice. To let go of that added on clutter, and those attachments—to not give those our attention; this is Zen. Letting go of that which wants to gather and stick and clutter. To not let those things hold us back, but rather to be like the water that goes down stream, meeting big tree trunks and big boulders and not being caught by any of them, just continuing to flow and flow.\nThe disciples felt that it was inappropriate to have these flowers falling and sticking on them, and Sariputra protested. But the Goddess asked, “Why? Why are you protesting?” To be caught on such a thing as a flower falling down and sticking onto you? This is the path of the person who is training only for themselves in the mountains, for their own personal liberation. This is not the path where one is practicing for all beings in society. And it is not the way for only a monk but for everyone. To encounter all those people as equals: that is what the teaching of the flowers falling was for. Everyone should be able to encounter the teaching of the Buddha. It is your misunderstanding to think that having flowers fall down on you because you’re an ordained person is something which is inappropriate. But in fact this was not your usual Goddess, after all; it was a transformed manifestation of Vimalakirti. It wouldn’t have been so interesting if Vimalakirti had said all these things. Much more interesting is to have a Goddess dropping down flowers that get stuck on disciples and not on Bodhisattvas. The one who is teaching the Way, this is Vimalakirti explaining how all things are equal and how it is important to not be attached to any of them. Vimalakirti is saying how it is necessary to see this clearly, and that is why he taught it in this way.\nThe Bodhisattvas did not have flowers sticking on them because they lived in the society with the same pain and attachments and struggle as everyone in society. To be in this world of conflict and difficulty and live there like everyone else, yet be unattached to anything that happens, any difficulty, any struggle within that world! That is why the flowers don’t stick on the Bodhisattvas. And the Bodhisattvas would not be bothered if the flowers did stick.\nIn society, things are always changing. It is possible for anything to change at any second, and we must live with this changeability without being caught on it. To be able to be strong and not moved around, no matter what comes along—this is the way of the Bodhisattvas. And it is because they know this state of mind that the flowers did not stick to them.  Sutra Śāriputra said, “Have you stayed in this room long?”  Goddess: “I have stayed in this room as long as you have been emancipated.”\nŚāriputra said, “How long have you stayed here?” The goddess said, “How long has it been since your emancipation?” Śāriputra was silent and did not answer.\nThe goddess said, “What is your great wisdom that you remain silent?”\nŚāriputra: “Emancipation is not to be spoken of, and so I did not know what to say.”\nThe goddess said, “Speech and words are entirely the characteristics of emancipation. Why? “Emancipation is neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Words are also neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Therefore, Śāriputra, the explanation of emancipation does not transcend words. Why?\n“All dharmas have the characteristic of emancipation.”\n Teisho  Sariputra asks the Goddess how long has she been there. She says it has been as long as the elder, (an elder was considered someone who was sixty and then again who was eighty) Sariputra, has been liberated. And then she says, “You can’t answer about how long you’ve been liberated, and yet you are calling yourself a top disciple.” To this, Sariputra said, in liberation, there is no need for words and no time, and so these cannot be expressed. But the Goddess disagrees with his words. Why can’t you express it? If you cannot, it is not the real thing. And if your mind is truly free there is no being caught on an idea of time and space. Saying that there is no time, as if you can say that you won’t die if you are liberated. But you still have to be able to express it. Even if you are awakened, your body still has a limited life expectancy. And if you think dying is melancholy, then that is not the true liberation. To be free from that idea of a physical body: the body does not exist in isolation. It has a physical reality, and it also has, with this liberation, a need to do teaching. And if we have a body, to use it for awakening and then to go into society with what we have realized and use that body to help bring others to liberation. To even one day sooner realize liberation and bring it to all of society, this is what is most important and this the point of our body’s existence. Whether we have many awakened days or few awakened days, as many of those awakened days as we can get until our physical body needs to die from being physical, we should use our days to pass this liberation on to all beings. Even if we are awakened, our body has to die. We need to speak the words of liberation to others, and we need our body for doing this. Because we live, we are able to spread this awareness of awakening. The words that are telling of liberation are very important. We can’t just be silent. Vimalakirti, speaking through the Goddess, says that it has to be in this way: we use this body for liberation, not shying away from that, but to have this experience and then to bring it to all beings through this body and with these words.\n Sutra Śāriputra said, “Is it not also that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity?”  Teisho As Hakuin Zenji has said in his Song of Zazen, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be any place else. Realizing the thought of no thought as thought, whether singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.” This is not about us being caught on what we have realized and therefore thinking that it is something special. We align and we realize it, and seeing this we express it, but we are not caught on being awakened because we have had some experience. We are not caught on either saying hello and goodbye or on doing any of the things we do during our day. We do them wholeheartedly, and we offer everything that we learn and realize to others in this same way. “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning, we cannot be any place else.” Each mind moment is deeply steeped in this very clarity.  Sutra The goddess said, “On behalf of the self-conceited, the Buddha explained that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity. If one is not self-conceited, the Buddha explains that licentiousness, anger, and stupidity are emancipation.” 10. Śāriputra said, “Excellent, excellent! O goddess, what attainment do you have, and through what realization do you have eloquence such as this?”  Teisho Here, Vimalakirti is saying that liberation is not just about being freed from greed, anger, and delusion. Right in the middle of having those (feelings of desire, hatred, and folly), to not be attached. This is where we find liberation. If you are awakened you can speak freely in order to bring this awakening to everyone. But this is what Sariputra is still caught on. We have to see what the Buddha has helped us to realize: that it is important for us to not sit down on what we have understood, and to always be continuing in our awareness and deepening it. To not only know that we should not be caught on greed, anger and delusion, but to live in a way that we are not caught on them while seeing that within them there is also a way to further liberation. Not to be thinking that only I am awakened and be proud of that, but to live from that awakened state in a way that others can learn from it. And here he is saying that if you are still moved around by greed, anger and ignorance, or if you are still moved around by time, by space, and by acquiring, that is not true liberation. The Buddha had said, “Those who are not caught on those attributes are those who are humble. And those who are humble are those who are free of pride and can see that from the very nature of desire, hatred and folly, one can realize liberation.” This is the true liberation. To be able to see this we have to let go of our own idea of being special and let go of our attached feelings of greed, fear, and anger. But to see that within those three feelings, there is also a liberation possible: we have to have the honesty to see ourselves clearly in relationship to these feelings. What the Buddha has taught is what the Goddess is telling Sariputra. But Sariputra is still caught on his idea of liberation being something which is more narrow. This awakening has to be not only for a single person, but for the awakening of all beings. And within that universal experiencing of desire, hatred, and folly, we find that liberation. Finally, finally, Sariputra has agreed. Excellent, excellent Goddess, pray what have you attained, what have you realized that you have such eloquence? To be able to speak that truth, that is what is so important, otherwise how can we share it with other people?\n Sutra The goddess said, “It is because I am without attainment and without realization that my eloquence is like this. Why? If one had attainment and realization, this would be to be self-conceited with regard to the Buddha-Dharma.”\nAnd the Goddess says that I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra. I have no realization, therefore I have such eloquence. Whoever thinks I have attained, I have realized, is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught Dharma. The very idea that I am awakened or that one is awakened, is an obstruction. I have nothing that complex going on. The Goddess is not moved around by what Sariputra is saying in the slightest bit.  Sutra Śāriputra asked the goddess, “Which of the three vehicles do you seek?”   Teisho And the Goddess answers,  Sutra The goddess said, “Since I convert sentient beings with the śrāvaka Dharma I am a śrāvaka. Since I convert sentient beings with the Dharma of causality I am a pratyekabuddha. Since I convert sentient beings with the Dharma of great compassion, I am a Mahayanist.  Teisho Sariputra asks this question, still not realizing that the Goddess is a manifestation of Vimalakirti’s wisdom. This is only a question one would ask the Goddess, assuming that she was not yet awakened, so it is not such a good question that Sariputra is putting to the Goddess here, bringing in these various vehicles, not only that of the Bodhisattva. Here, however, she is answering straightforwardly that she is trying to awaken others with whatever means can best serve that person in that particular situation. And she speaks from her core in this answer. She explains how she considers the various vehicles and how their usefulness depends upon the person to be liberated. No one vehicle should be used for every person in every situation. And as usual she refuses to be caught on his question and shows that she will align according to the situation. In this way, the Goddess answers Sariputra.  Sutra “Śāriputra, just as a person who has entered a campaka forest can smell only campaka and no other smells, thus it is if you enter this room— you can smell only the fragrance of the Buddha’s merit and do not delight in smelling the fragrance of the merit of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.   Teisho The Goddess here gives her answer, saying that the Buddha taught according to each person’s capabilities and how that teaching is never fixed or permanent. All is in flux, there is nothing fixed, and only if we can see this straightforwardly can we know this state of mind of the Buddha. We hold the pain and the insecurity of others, and simultaneously realize that deeper place which is clear. Not being caught on one’s impermanent realization, but seeing there is always further to go. So, why does this anxiety then come up when we get older? It is because we are always thinking that we are going to be young forever. And so we live with our unlimited desires, spreading our anger in every direction, unable to contain that greed. We have to stop putting pressure on others, trying to get what we think that we want out of everything and everyone. There are so many people in this whole world with no food today. When we see this suffering, we know how shallow we are when we chase around our impermanence by using our time and energy for getting that which we desire, focusing on our fear, and expressing our anger. Everyday we live our lives seeing how our bodies are dying. We have to see not only that but also that huge, clear, wide open emptiness of the great blue sky, that ancient sky. We have to become this state of mind as well as the one that knows that we are not always going to be in this physical body. If that huge ancient wide open sky is eternal, then isn’t our mind eternal as well? Don’t we just get caught on some idea of a small self? We have to bring ourselves to see clearly how this is only a borrowed body. As the great master Ikkyu said, “This body, which I have been able to use until this day, this month, this year, I now return.”  Sutra “Śāriputra, those Indras, Brahmās, four heavenly kings, and the gods, dragons, and spirits who enter this room all hear this Superior One (i.e., Vimalakīrti) explain the correct Dharma, and they all leave delighting [only] in the fragrance of the Buddha’s merit and generating the intention [to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi].  Teisho No matter what we are caught on, to let it go, to see this immense, clear mind, which is like that huge blue sky, and realize that we are that hugeness of mind. We do have to develop it and apply it in many small ways to do different things in our daily life, but instead of seeing that as who we are, to make efforts together for all people. To not divide that state of mind into small pieces, but to live under that huge sky and realize that as our eternal mind.  Sutra “Śāriputra, I have stayed in this room twelve years. From the beginning I have not heard the Dharma of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha; I have only heard the buddhas’ inconceivable Dharma of the bodhisattvas’ great sympathy and great compassion.  Teisho “I have been here in this house for twelve years,” but this is not about time. It might not be about years but could be about cycles, weeks, or months; twelve just stands for many, whether it’s years, cycles, or months. Sariputra, I don’t remember exactly how long I have been here but I have only ever heard of the great vehicle here, nothing about dividing and enumerating, only to forget yourself and teach for others. There has never once been any talk of dividing it into small parcels of teaching or ways of teaching. Liberation is about all of those ways of teaching at their appropriate moment. We reach people by different ways because they are all expressions of the wisdom of the Buddha. And all of these means are the expression of the one great teaching. In this way the Goddess teaches.\nSariputra was the most wise of all the disciples, and because of that he is made the bad guy in this section. If one has deep wisdom, it is essential to not be conceited about having that deep wisdom. Wisdom has no limits. It has to be constantly deepened. It cannot be left unripe and narrow. We have to open our mind to its greatest possible extent for the sake of all people, so that each and every one can realize this huge mind, free of all attachments and obstructions. And then, realizing the truth of the Buddha-dharma, it does not end even with that: for all of us, then, to do a huge cleaning of our mind and let go of all of our tangled and unnecessarily confused and unrealized places. This hugeness is available for anyone, but if we stay caught on being a small self, which is divided and isolated, we cannot realize this hugeness of mind. To believe in humans’ truest deepest core, to help others realize that, and to live from that core ourselves: this is the way of truth. We have the four immeasurable ways of true mind—to live in infinite love, to live in infinite realization, and to endlessly support each other in doing this. To know this place and to help each other realize it and live together. To take care of each other’s insecurities. To make these efforts continually. This is what is being taught here.\n Sutra “Śāriputra, this room constantly manifests eight unprecedentedly rare dharmas. What are these eight?   Teisho The Goddess appears in Vimalakirti’s room and does a mondo with Sariputra, who keeps losing to her every time. Finally, the heavenly being talks about the eight advanced Buddha qualities of Vimalakirti’s room. In this place, there is a light brighter than gold, always shining, a light of wisdom as the Goddess describes it. And anyone who has an insecure state of mind can find peace here. Harada Roshi finds Mumon Roshi From the Roshi’s own experience, from which he apologizes for speaking, he wants to tell about when he was a student and he went to Kyoto to do an errand for his father. To do this errand he had to go on a bus from Kyoto station to the large headquarters temple, Myoshin-ji. It was about an hour away from the station by bus. The bus was filled with passengers on their way to work and school, many of them standing. He rode in this very full bus and noticed that everyone looked heavy and dark, challenged by this long, rush hour trip on their way to work or school. But as he looked at the faces, suddenly there was one that was very different. It was very bright. And the person with this bright face was wearing a koromo. It was a priest who had this bright face. And when he went to get off the bus, at the stop where he had to do the errand for his father, he saw the priest getting off at the same stop. The priest was going to Reiunin temple. He could see this because he followed him. From that moment, he decided that this person with this bright face would be the one he would continue to follow.  Sutra i) “This room is always illuminated with golden light, with no variation day or night. It is not bright due to the illumination of sun and moon. This is the first unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho In our mind, there is for everyone this true bright light, and this great light will enable us to see through all things. This is possible for all beings.  Sutra ii) “Those who enter this room are not afflicted by the defilements. This is the second unprecedentedly rare dharma.iii) “This room always has Indras, Brahmās, the four heavenly kings, and bodhisattvas from other regions who arrive and gather without interruption. This is the third unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho We all want to meet someone who can receive our pressing and difficult qualities. There are some people who are able to do that without our even knowing them. Before we can even ask our question or express our deep need for an answer to somehow squelch our insecure mind, a person says something, or just by being the way they are, makes that very question disappear.  Sutra iv) “In this room there is constant explanation of the six perfections and the nonretrogressive Dharma. This is the fourth unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho At Vimalakirti’s house, many gathered, but none of them there were anxious. It is not necessary to understand small minded opinions. Everyone there was settled and in harmony. No one spoke of disadvantages and dislikes, personal interest or personal attitudes. In that atmosphere where there was nothing like that going on: this is how the Dharma was in Vimalakirti’s house. And everyone, whether they were knowledgable about Dharma or not, they would be lifted up to know that deepest truth and moved to begin their path or to realize the next step along their way. And this is the way it was in the house of Vimalakirti.  Sutra v) “This room always produces the gods’ supreme string music, which generates the sound of the teaching of the immeasurable Dharma. This is the fifth unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho The Goddess who was there arranged it so that you always heard music in Vimalakirti’s room. The Roshi knows of a temple where he would go with Mumon Roshi, when he was alive, as his attendant. The priest there had a particularly loud voice, and he was in charge of finances at Hanazono University, where Mumon Roshi was the head person. So they would discuss this, and the priest would always be speaking loudly in his booming voice. Roshi remembers that at the end of their discussions Mumon Roshi would say to him, “I ask your best,” at which point this priest would stop all of his talking. And then there would be silence. In that silence, when this man’s huge, creative, working voice stopped, it was so quiet that the sounds of the cicadas would be louder than he ever had heard them before.  Sutra vi) “This room has four great storehouses filled with the many jewels, which are given to the destitute and used to save the poor without limit. This is the sixth unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho And what were these treasure houses that were found here at Vimalakirti’s? They were the treasures of offering and using kind and loving words, and there was always someone there who needed this. One could always come there and be spoken to with kind words emphasized. This is one of the greatest treasures of Vimalakirti’s house. There are places where people always come, and places where people don’t come so often.  Teisho Omori Sogen Roshi, who trained with Yamada Mumon Roshi, would say, “There are always people coming to Mumon’s place. He always has a huge stash of things that people are bringing to him. But why don’t they come to my place?” Mumon Roshi would always, always, give whenever anybody came to see him. Even if a student asked and he said, “Are you asking me for an allowance again? You just asked me the other day.” But then after saying he shouldn’t be relied on so heavily, he would immediately give him more allowance. Eventually, he would give it in every case, even when the situation was shady. Anybody who saw these people coming in and asking Mumon Roshi for money would say, “What is he doing, giving these people money?” They would come to request more favors and more favors and he would always give them what they asked for. He would sometimes get furious—described as a person who has triangular eyes—with his monks. But when people would come and ask him for something, he would always laugh and smile and give them whatever they wanted. Even though he was offered a medal of honor from the country, he said, “No, thank you.” He had no use of that. He had already received the medal he needed from the Buddha. He needed nothing more.  Sutra vii) “To this room Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, Jewel Virtue Buddha, Jewel Mirage Buddha, Jewel Moon Buddha, Jewel Ornament Buddha, Difficult to Overcome Buddha, Lion’s Echo Buddha, and Achievement of All Benefits Buddha, and the immeasurable buddhas of the ten directions such as these all come when the Superior One is mindful of them; and they extensively explain to him the buddhas’ secret Dharma storehouse and, having explained it, then return [to their own worlds]. This is the seventh unprecedentedly rare dharma.  Teisho Vimalakirti’s room, not only held Shakyamuni Buddha and Amitabha, but also all of the others listed there. They would all give their particular secret teachings. And Vimalakirti would simply listen, humbly, and say, “Yes! Yes!” Listening to what they said and then sending them on their way. Everyone was so happy that he had listened to them and allowed them to teach. The advanced disciples were glad to hear all of these various teachings, yet these were never obstructions to what they were doing in their practice, just many different versions of the same teaching. And no one would have any preconceived notions, but listen openly to all of them.  Sutra viii) “In this room appear all the ornamented palaces of the gods and the pure lands of the buddhas. This is the eighth unprecedentedly rare dharma.“Śāriputra, this room always manifests the eight unprecedentedly rare dharmas. Who could see these inconceivable things and still take pleasure in the śrāvaka Dharma?”  Teisho An abundance of different teachings and information was brought into this one space and shared continuously: it would not seem so strange today, with our access to the internet. But in those days it was astonishing, and this is how they realized Dharma brilliantly. Learning things directly—right in front of their faces, saying at the same time that they were not yet fulfilled in their understanding of the Dharma. All of them very humbly knew that even with all of this, it was still not sufficiently developed within each of them.  Sutra Śāriputra said, “Why do you not transform your female body?”  The goddess said, “For the past twelve years I have sought the characteristic of being female and have comprehended it to be unattainable (i.e., imperceptible). Why should I transform it? It is as if a magician has created a conjured female. If someone asked her, ‘Why do you not transform your female body?’ would that person’s question be proper or not?”\nŚāriputra said, “It would not. An indeterminate characteristic that has been conjured—why should it be transformed?”\nThe goddess said, “All dharmas are also like this, in being without determinate characteristics. So why do you ask, ‘Why do you not transform your female body?’”\n Teisho Sariputra spoke so condescendingly to the Goddess because he had not yet seen that the Goddess was a manifestation, a version, of Vimalakirti. And here, again, when it says, “Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years,” the term “twelve years” refers to some long, indeterminate period of time. In the same way that Hakuin Zenji wrote, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning, we cannot be any place else.” This form of no form is what is being talked about: letting go of an idea of a female state since no such thing is possibly describable. We don’t eat differently because we are male or female. We eat and do zazen and samu wholeheartedly, not differently because we call ourselves a male or a female. The Goddess tells how it is a fact, Vimalakirti never falls into that rather common idea that if a woman was very lucky in her next incarnation, she might be incarnated as a man.  Sutra Then the goddess used the power of numinous penetration and changed Śāriputra’s body to be like that of a goddess, and she transformed her own body to be like Śāriputra. She then asked, “Why do you not transform this female body?”  Śāriputra, in the goddess’s form, answered, “I do not know how you transformed me now into this female body.”\nThe goddess said, “Śāriputra, if you were able to transform this female body, then all females would also be able to transform themselves. Just as Śāriputra is not female but is manifesting a female body, so are all females likewise. Although they manifest female bodies, they are not female.\n“Therefore, the Buddha has explained that all dharmas are neither male nor female.”\n Teisho This is to show you that all things are not male or female. The Goddess then offers another way to look at this. Can one really say being male is better than being female? This is an idea of a difference only; It is not real, but only an appearance. It is only something imagined. It does not exist in the absolute. In the spring the flowers bloom, but are these flowers male or female? In the summer, a tree becomes full of leaves. These leaves, are they male or female? In the winter, the branches remain with no sign of life on them anywhere. Are these branches male or female? All of these things are form. They are not permanent but always in transition. As the Goddess was saying, all of these have no defined existences, male or female. Then the Goddess turned herself into Sariputra and asked the female version of Sariputra, “What are you doing in a female form now?” This was to show that all things are not male or female, that that is only a matter of kimono, appearances. “You may be deeply awakened, but you are still confused about the appearance of male and female,” she says to Sariputra. You have to see all of this differently: endowed with these forms, we support each other from within these forms, but it is the true master, which is beyond these forms, which must be realized.\n Sutra At this point the goddess withdrew her numinous power, and Śāriputra’s body returned to as it was before.\nThe goddess asked Śāriputra, “Now where does the characteristic of form of the female body occur?”\nŚāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”\nThe goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”\n Teisho What Vimalakirti really is trying to say here is that, in fact, there is nothing about being male or female that is beyond appearances. Our truest nature is not male and is not female. And because we know this, we can use that original nature and also that form of being male or female fully without confusion and see how all people, no matter what form, are equal. In the world there are men and women, and from that form all functioning is born. But the true nature is not distinguished by being male or female. We are all that truest center and from that center, we make use of our male or female form and our clear nature to offer everything to society. We have to honor and respect each other’s appearance. We have to see that each and every person has a clear human mind. And to be able to see it in the same way that we see the trees and rivers and mountains: all have a value, their own particular individual value, and all are absolutely equal. Seeing it this way is how everything can be truthfully realized.\nToday it is still not truly equal, but 2,500 years ago there was even more prejudice and discrimination. It was the Mahayana from that time on that taught to let go of the view that held to discrimination between men and women, and see them as equal. And to let go of any idea that women can be liberated only when they are reborn into a further life in the future. Therefore it was the Mahayana that was able to guide people, all people, to awaken now (not that some of us have to wait for a future opportunity). It’s like the Sixth Patriarch said when he was challenged at the place of the Fifth Patriarch, where he was called a person from an undeveloped part of China: “In the Buddha nature there is no north or south. In the clear original mind there is nothing to be discriminated against.”\nThe Goddess releases Sariputra from the form of a woman and brings him back to his original form with a final statement of how it actually is, beyond prejudice.\n Sutra The goddess asked Śāriputra, “Now where does the characteristic of form of the female body occur?”\nŚāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”\nThe goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”\n Teisho The wisdom of Vimalakirti is the expression of the Mahayana teaching that everyone is endowed with the Buddha nature. To make this even more clear, this Goddess and Sariputra are having a conversation here in Vimalakirti’s Sutra. This sutra is the most like an opera, with many stories and characters. At this point in the opera it is teaching that there should be no discrimination between persons who are male or female because within the form of things everything is one and equal. But here, this idea is dramatized: the Goddess who is representing the female, turns Sariputra, who represents the male, into a woman, and then she becomes Sariputra. Then the Goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary form. She then said to him, “Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with your female form?” It appears that we have a particular form of being a man or being a woman. These trillions of cells, which make up a human body, some of them become our eyes, some of them become our ears. Some become an intestine and some become a bone. And this is how a human being’s body is produced. It is the same in this world: we can’t eat only fish all the time. So we don’t have only fishermen and fish sellers and people who bring fish to the market. We also need spices. And we need clothes for the four rotating seasons. And so we have many different people doing many different kinds of jobs. Many material things that are useful. This is the truth of the world of material things, all through it.\nEven so, if it’s a man it’s still Buddha nature, a woman is Buddha nature, a child is Buddha nature, an adult is Buddha nature, a sick person is Buddha nature, a healthy person is Buddha nature. A person who is working is Buddha nature, one who is not working is Buddha nature. Everyone expresses something different, but everyone’s source is one and the same. No matter what version of human being we are, we are able to actualize it and bring it forth into the world. This is humans’ way of being and our wisdom and that is what is being taught here.\n Sutra Śāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”  Teisho The Goddess shows Sariputra with her supernatural powers how it is to be a woman. And once he’s understood this she releases him back to his usual form as a Sariputra, teasing him by asking where has his female form gone. And in this way, Sariputra responds, “I neither made it nor did I change it.” The body is always changing in every instant. It only looks this way in this very second. Before lunch, when we are hungry, we can become very irritable. But after lunch we are calm and easy, just with the difference of one single meal. We think we are the same person all the time, but we are always changing. We are always without any permanent, fixed form. This is the way that it is said in the teaching of Hakuin Zenji: “Realizing the form of no form as form”. This no form way of being, we mentally understand it, and yet we then look for a something called a no form. Muso Kokushi, the founder of Tenryu-ji, whose name meant “dream window”, was always traveling—to Kyoto, to Tokyo, never staying in any single place and residing there. And someone asked him what this was like, to abide nowhere. Muso Kokushi said, “No, it wasn’t about abiding nowhere.” He never went anywhere. He was always in his own house, on this planet.”\n Just like how we don’t think that we are going somewhere when we go into the next room in our house. We go into a bathroom, we go into a living room. We don’t think, “Now I have gone somewhere.” In the same way, on this planet, wherever we are is the place that we are at that time. The planet, all over, is our house. It is not that we have gone some place, nor did we come back from some place. We’re always right where we are. This is true for a child or for a person who is an adult. We become that moment’s appropriate state of mind. And we can always encounter a person with their similar state of mind: meeting a child, we become like a child; meeting an adult, we are like an adult. As Hakuin Zenji has said in his work, the Song of Zazen, “As with water and ice, there is no ice without water. Apart from sentient beings, there are no Buddhas.” Water in a cup can then be poured out of a cup and into a plate. And the water from the plate can then be poured into a jar. This is the truth of no form. But if we are always holding onto a hardened fixed form of an “I” or a “me, me, me” we cannot fit into anything else. But people are always being caught on the form. This is what the Goddess is teaching this Sariputra. When sitting, we do it with the state of mind of becoming that sitting. When walking we become that state of mind of walking, and when we are working we become the state of mind of working. It cannot be understood conceptually but only by becoming it completely.  Sutra The goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”  Teisho That is true, and not only for humans. It is also true of soft new leaves, which develop into stronger, firm, deeper green leaves. And with the chill of Autumn winds, those leaves change into brilliant colors, dance, swirl, fall to the ground. When the snow comes, the branches are bare with no more leaves there. But the leaves do not no longer exist; they have become the earth, the flowers, the bark. Our forms are always changing, and that is how it is in the world: that in every instant, everything is changing. In India, for example, we have the Indus river and the Ganges river. It seems that those are always the same rivers. But each river, all rivers, are always changing. If it was always the same river, then the water would become stagnant and rotten. The scenery of the fall and the scenery of the spring clearly inform us that we can stop being caught on conceptual ideas of what a particular piece of land should look like, because it is always changing. Things don’t stay the same. We have a concept of what it means to be old or elderly or young. And we also have many, many, freer ways of looking at something. We don’t see in the same way that dogs, cats and rabbits see things. Our perceptions are well aligned. Our left and right eyes are in alignment and focus on a single point. The evolution of our visual equipment has enabled us to perceive well this abundantly filled world. And we can see, in that way, from these eyes, how things are always changing, not only in regard to a thing, but also in a place, and in a moment. We do what is on our mind; we see flowers blooming, we see the petals falling. Then we decide we would like to put this into a poem or share it with someone. So, while the object is always changing form, so also is the way we receive and express these things. We have to be able to grasp this in our deepest true heart, though. To not always think that this moment is how things will always be. Instead, to see that this is the way it is in this moment, only. To be able to really see this completely and totally, we do zazen. We do not do zazen to have lots of mozo and lots of extra thinking. We do zazen to be in awareness, to receive and realize that which is true in the moment. If we can see this clearly, then we can make something. And if we are not seeing things in this way, that it is always changing in every second, then we are making a big mistake. To see all the people just as they are, in their perfected mind, no matter how it is they may appear. And from here comes this place where we can perceive what life is actually for, what our particular purpose is. And then we can see that the singing bird and everything else is also changing. And with this true deep awareness, we can guide and show it to others. This is how the Dharma works, always, in each and every instant: with everything in transience, with everything different from how it was until now and different from how it will be from now.\n Sutra Śāriputra asked the goddess, “When you die here, where will you be reborn?”  The goddess said, “Wherever the Buddha’s [activity of] conversion is born (i.e., generated), likewise will I be born.”\n[Śāriputra] said, “Where the Buddha’s [activity of] conversion is generated is not [a place] of death and birth.”\nThe goddess said, “Sentient beings are likewise without death and birth.”\n Teisho In fact, Sariputra wouldn’t say something like that, but it is for the purpose of this story going as it has to go, that he says it. When the Buddha was born, he was already dedicated to working toward the liberation of all beings for all the eighty years he was alive. But we cannot, even hearing this, be deceived by an idea of things being fixed. Realize that no matter what and who we are, if we have any idea of being that, then we have to pull off that ‘kimono’ and see what is actually there. But anyone with an awareness knows, as Master Ikkyu said, until today we’ve borrowed this body. This body is a borrowed thing, and now we return it at this time, this very day. We return this body, which we have been given to use. In this always changing world, we are seeing how material things are like our body as well: they appear to exist in the way the flowers do in the spring, in the way the maple leaves turning colors exist in the autumn.\n “I leave no gifts,” this is what the Master Ryokan said. “But when I die, I leave all these things to you. These flowers in the spring, the cool wind in the summer, the turning leaves in the fall, the quiet snow in the winter.” Like the Buddha who has been telling us to see, “What is it that is looking at those flowers and those maple leaves?” He never stops telling us this. It has never died and has never been born. This is not about some place. There is nothing of truth in the whole world except that truth that everything is always changing, and that is the way of nature. Our mind’s truest deepest wisdom must see this clearly, or how can we know this truest deepest amazement.\n Sutra Śāriputra asked the goddess, “How long will it be until you attain anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi?”\nThe goddess said, “When you are reborn as an [unenlightened] ordinary person, I will achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.”\nŚāriputra said, “For me to be an ordinary person—this will never happen!”\nThe goddess said, “My attaining of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi—this too will never happen. Why? Bodhi is without any locus of abiding. Therefore there is no one who attains it.”\nŚāriputra said, “The buddhas who attain anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, including those who have attained it and those who will attain it, are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. What about all of them?”\n Teisho Sariputra says this to the Goddess: “For what then did Buddha leave behind all of those sutras and tell us to awaken, even a day sooner. Why are there so many monks, more than the grains of the Ganges’ sands. How could she say that there is no awakening?  Sutra ”The goddess said, “It is entirely through conventional words and numbers that one talks of the existence of the three periods of time. It is not that there is past, future, and present in bodhi!”The goddess said, “Śāriputra, have you attained arhatship?”  Teisho This is the Goddess speaking. “You are playing around with words and concepts, and your true mind won’t be realized by doing that. Who is it that says those words? And who is it that is hearing them?” She continues, “You are grasping after a clear mind you think you have left behind somewhere. Tell me, elder, have you attained sainthood? If you think you are awakened or if you think you are not awakened, that is all only fooling yourself. There is no such form to be grasped, nor is there anything to be achieved or acquired. So there is nothing to say you understand and no attachment to anything. Isn’t that attaining sainthood?” Even if monks, as many as the sands of the Ganges, should awaken, they were still never without that originally clear mind. Don’t be deceived by any shadow of it. Nor does that mean that there is nothing to do and nothing to be done. What does that mean that there is nothing to do? Nor should we be staying deluded eternally if we don’t realize this. Don’t be scared by your own shadow.  Sutra Śāriputra said, “There is no attainment, and so have I attained it.”  Teisho The goddess said, “The buddhas and bodhisattvas are also like this. There is no attainment, and so have they attained anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.”\nMaster Bankei Zenji says in his teaching on the Heart Sutra, that the human mind is like a mirror. Just because something is reflected in the mirror doesn’t mean the mirror gets heavier. Or if something unpleasant is reflected in the mirror it doesn’t become damaged, nor is the mind harmed by something which is reflected in it. Nor does it increase because something is reflected there and decrease when the reflection goes away. These are all words from the Heart Sutra. It comes, it’s there, it goes. And the mirror is then again empty without a trace. This is the teaching of Bankei Zenji.  Sutra At this time Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “The goddess has already served ninety-two koṭis of buddhas. She is able to disport in the numinous penetrations of the bodhisattva, her vows are complete, she has attained forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas, and she abides in nonretrogression. By virtue of her original vows she is able to manifest the teaching of sentient beings as she wishes.”   Teisho Since Sariputra is in the room with Vimalakirti, we just had a momentary change of scenery here. Vimalakirti tells Sariputra this is not just your regular, ordinary Goddess you’re talking to here. She is filled with her great vow in every single instant, in every single direction, and in every single location. She takes every opportunity to liberate others, becoming every form in the world possible, like Kannon taking all forms. This is her way of offering us challenges that are difficult—sometimes even becoming awful, terrifying forms that have to be caught by the policemen. But these are to offer us bad examples as well, giving us wisdom in the reverse way. That is the way of teaching when we become sick or when we die suddenly—teaching that it is only this one instant that we can know. Suddenly a parent dies or a child dies. We feel as if we have been dropped from heaven into hell in one instant. We experience this and we realize that all of these experiences give us deepening wisdom. All kinds of people, all kinds of experiences—we can see that wisdom from all of them. We receive that wisdom and that teaching in many ways so that we can know these infinite forms of functioning. And this is the way that Vimalakirti is teaching us.\n      ","id":56,"length":27812,"title":"Chapter 7: The dialogue continues and the Goddess appears","type":"essay","url":"https://emptyhut.github.io/vimalakirti/sutra/chapter7/"}]
