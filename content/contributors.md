**Taigan Shodo Harada Roshi** is an esteemed Zen Master in the Rinzai tradition. He trained with Zen Master Yamada Mumon Roshi at Shofukuji Monastery in Kobe, Japan. After completing his training and receiving transmission, Harada Roshi became the Abbot of Sogenji, a Rinzai Zen Monastery in Okayama, Japan, where he has resided for the past twenty-five years. Sogenji is unique among training monasteries in Japan, training both women and men, ordained monks and laypeople side by side.

From the beginning of his tenure there, Harada Roshi has welcomed westerners to study with him. Students from more than thirty countries have resided and trained at Sogenji since Harada’s tenure began. In addition, Harada Roshi has traveled regularly to the United States, Europe, and India to provide training to zen students. Fourteen years ago, land was purchased on Whidbey Island in Washington state for the development of Tahoma-Sogenji One Drop Zen Monastery. Currently, Harada leads week-long intensive retreats for Zen students at Tahoma twice annually; a full time monastic training program is planned for the near future.

Shodo Harada Roshi has joyfully pursued the art of calligraphy for many years, employing bold, crisp strokes that reflect his manner of engaging with the universe. The contents of his calligraphies include a wide range of nature poems and zen sayings. The subject is always related to awakening to the universal truth.

**Daichi Zenni**, American born Rinzai Zen nun, who is Harada Roshi’s long time collaborator and student, has served as his translator for the past twenty-five years. She has translated all of the volumes from Japanese. It is through her efforts that we in the West have the opportunity to know Harada Roshi’s work and to study with him.
