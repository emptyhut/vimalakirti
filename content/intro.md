Starting in September 2009 during the fall sesshin at Tahoma Zen Monastery, Roshi give teisho (formal lectures) on the Vimalakirti Sutra. Roshi continued to teach the sutra each spring and fall sesshin through to September 2014. 

The teisho were transcribed and published as a series starting in 2012 with a volume on chapters 5 and 6 with the theme of 'who is it that is ill?'. In 2013 chapters 1 and 2 were published; followed by chapters 3 through 5 in 2014, chapters 6 through 9 in 2015, and the final volume in 2016 on chapters 10 through 14. 

Each year Roshi provided calligraphies to highlight teachings from the sutra. 

In this book we have gathered together the calligraphy, the portions of the sutra and Roshi's teisho on those portions.  

It is a great pleasure to present this volume of Shodo Harada Roshiâ€™s calligraphies and teachings. The original  volumes were hand published and presented as gifts to his students. This is the first time these calligraphic images and accompanying teachings, have been offered to a larger audience. Please enjoy both the calligraphies and the teishos which accompany them.
