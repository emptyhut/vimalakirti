#### Shodo, the art of Japanese brush painting

Shodo is the name for Japanese calligraphy. But more generally and properly, Shodo is the art of coordinating mind, body, and brush. In Japanese calligraphy, Chinese characters which comprise the written language of Japan are brushed with black ink on paper or silk, usually in the form of scrolls. Fluid lines create these letters through a series of dragging, pressing and sweeping actions of the brush. Once begun, each calligraphy is produced in a single moment. There is no opportunity for outlining, filling in, repairing, or augmenting ill-formed lines or characters; for one sheet of paper there is only one chance to produce a finished calligraphy. Therefore, the work must be entered with a settled mind and executed with unfaltering confidence.

Training in the art of calligraphy involves practice in ink preparation, brush stroke technique, the shape and construction of letters, and placement and spacing of the characters on the sheet. Yet technical facility is not the primary measure of great calligraphic art. The work of calligraphy masters is suffused with spirit, ki, the direct expression of mind and energy. This quality is perceptible in the strength and fluidity of the lines and characters produced. It is also visible at a microscopic level in the alignment of
the ink particles (bokhi) in the brushed lines.

#### Calligraphy and Zen
The calligraphic line is a lasting trace of the mind that produced it. The quality of the line reflects the mind of the calligrapher in the moment of executing the brush stroke. It cannot be otherwise, Harada Roshi says.

The calligrapher becomes one with the brush in the moment of executing each line.

Omori Sogen, a 20th centery Zen master, puts it like this: “For a line to be properly composed, the mind must be composed.” The emphasis is on focusing all of one’s attention on the act of writing. Zen calligrapher Terayama Katsujo comments, “What matters above all is the utilization of the entire body and mind in the ‘here’ and ‘now’. The problem is not ‘How to write beautifully’, but rather ‘How to be awakened through writing.’” Realizing what is in the here and now as distinct from what has been in the past or will be in the future, what might be expected, feared, or hoped for: that is the task. The present moment contains all that is, even as it is fleeting and incapable of being held onto. The trace, left by the ink on the brush in the moment of creation, is an impression of the mind that produced it in that instant.

Professional calligrapher Gochiku puts it this way: “Technical skill comes from training with a brush, while the heart of a work comes from training the mind.” Since alignment of mind is the province of Zen meditation, the link between Shodo and Zen is strong. In fact, there is a specific term, Zenga, to denote Zen Buddhist calligraphy and brush painting. In zenga, the strict aesthetic rules that govern non-Buddhist calligraphy are disregarded. The message, expressing the state of mind of liberation, is what is of primary importance. Often, letters and images are combined in the same piece.

All of the zen arts and zen meditation are intended to focus attention on the present moment. Through the practice and mastery of zen meditation, the mind is emptied of extraneous thoughts and preoccupations; constraints of attachment are shed. When we are not pulled around by our thoughts and emotions or stuck on our attachments, our perspective broadens beyond our personal concerns, and our responsiveness increases. The expression on paper becomes unhesitating and spontaneous.

Harada Roshi emphasizes that “the essential way of being and the true way of seeing” enable free-flowing and harmonious expression in all the arts, including calligraphy, tea ceremony, ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement), kudo (archery), or kendo (swordsmanship). This immediate and direct expression can only be achieved when ego filters and ideas of a self are cast aside and we become one with the whole universe.

Thus, the practices of Zen meditation and Japanese calligraphy complement each other. Many Zen masters have become accomplished calligraphers. Some, like Omori Sogen, use Shodo as a form of Zen practice; some employ the calligraphies as a teaching device and a link to Zen history and wisdom.

Hakuin Zenji, an eighteenth century Rinzai Zen master of profound depth and energy, is perhaps the most famous Zen calligrapher and exemplar of zenga. He left a huge number of calligraphies, many of which combined letters and images in the same work, even using stylized letters or characters to denote representational images. Harada Roshi notes that in Hakuin’s case, calligraphy is truly an extension of his single-minded vow to liberate all sentient beings. He wanted to pass this message on and used his letters to touch as many people as he could.

#### Calligraphy, content and context

Phrases on calligraphy scrolls most often represent familiar sayings, poems, or koans from Zen wisdom or Japanese literature. Frequently the sayings reflect images of nature in the seasons and their metaphoric relationship to states of mind. Other frequent images on scrolls include nature landscapes and common Zen symbols such as ensos (circles), staffs, and images of Bodhidharma, the founding patriarch of Zen.

Koans are puzzling questions or paradoxical problems taken from comments or conversations of the ancient Zen masters, which have been cataloged and kept alive over the centuries. In the Rinzai tradition, Zen students are asked to meditate on a koan from morning to night, night until morning, until they become one with it. The “solution” is not an intellectual understanding of the problem but a direct experience of its truth.
Writing the koans calligraphically is sometimes done as a meditation: a way of focusing body, mind, and spirit on the words, images and feelings of the koan. When the student approaches the paper with ‘no-mind’ (mu-shin) and becomes one with the brush and the characters and the koan, the “answer” to the koan may be revealed; simultaneously, a powerful calligraphy is produced. The qualities of fluidity, firmness, and vigor are seen in the lines, and the qualities of spaciousness and balance are evident in and between the characters on the sheet. There is a merging of self and koan. It is the manifestation of oneness that is at the heart of Zen.

Just as koan study is a meditation tool, another is being in the presence of nature and all that surrounds us. Sayings and poems that focus on observations of nature and truth in nature direct the attention of calligrapher and audience alike to the natural world and the present moment within it. Further, these calligraphies pay homage to the wisdom of the ancient poets even as they become the object for being in the here-and-now with ink and brush and paper.
A frequent image of Zen calligraphers, including Harada Roshi, is the enso, a circle that visually reveals both totality and void, wholeness and emptiness. Rather than being opposites, these characteristics merge into something singular and indissoluble: seeming dualities merge into Oneness, the basic tenet of Zen, in this single linear form. And like Zen practice, the process of producing that simple line to create a fluid, vigorous, and harmonious image is not easy.
Scrolls are traditionally mounted on silk and hung in temples, tea rooms, and individuals’ homes, often in tokonomas (alcove). At times in Japanese history, statues and images of Buddha were outlawed in an attempt to discourage the practice of Zen. Calligraphy scrolls hung in tokonomas came to represent the Buddha, and this practice continues today.

Unlike much of western art, fixed in frames and permanently hung, a Japanese calligraphy is frequently displayed for a particular occasion or for a season and then replaced or rotated with other scrolls. This aspect of Japanese calligraphy is consistent with other zen arts including flower arrangement and tea ceremony with the emphasis on freshness and attention to the constantly changing natural world.

Calligraphy has always played a role in Japanese tea ceremony. This ceremony is a formalized practice of serving and receiving matcha, whisked Japanese green tea, in an intimate setting. Typically, the ceremony is conducted in a small and spare room, measured to accommodate four and one-half tatami mats, bare except for tea making implements and a large niche or tokonoma. In the tokonoma is a single flower and a scroll, each appropriate to the current event or season. Everything in the small space is designed to direct the participants’ attention to the present moment: the warm, fragrant tea presented in a handmade bowl with its particular visual and tactile characteristics; the sweet and bitter tastes of the confection and the tea itself; the movements, sounds and gestures of the host and guests and the interaction between and among them.

Earlier it was mentioned that each calligraphy is rendered in a single moment--a moment in which the calligrapher becomes one with the brush. It is this immediacy that the calligraphy at its best can translate to the viewer: an opportunity to be in the moment and at one with the image as you experience it. This book of Shodo Harada Roshi’s work is offered in that spirit. Read it continuously, or open it randomly when it calls to you. Either way, the hope
is that you will encounter the feeling and energy that is central to Shodo Harada Roshi’s mastery of shodo. His calligraphies, along with his wise commentaries on the subjects depicted, reflect the spirit and delight at the heart of his approach to zen; and they are an invitation to explore life lived unencumbered by presumption and expectation--lived in the living.
