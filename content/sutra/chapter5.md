### Sutra
{{< q-class "sutra" >}}
1. At this point the Buddha addressed Mañjusri, “You go inquire about Vimalakirti’s illness.”

Mañjusri addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, that superior one is difficult to respond to.  
“He has profoundly attained the true characteristic, and he is good at explaining the essentials of the Dharma.  
“His eloquence is unhampered, and his wisdom is unhindered.  
“He completely understands all the deportments of the bodhisattvas, and he has entered into all the secret storehouses of the buddhas.  
“He has subjugated the host of Maras, and disports himself in the numinous penetrations. He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means.  
“Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”

Even though the Buddha had requested it of them, none the disciples felt that they were able to call on Vimalakirti, having been reprimanded and cautioned by him in previous encounters. They had all been exhorted by VImalakirti to improve their training and felt they were not good enough to meet him again. So now the Buddha asks Manjusri Bodhisattva to go.

Because it was a momentous event, a large entourage of eight thousand disciples, five hundred bodhisattvas, and a hundred thousand gods and goddesses all came with Manjusri to see Vimalakirti. 

### Sutra
3. At that time the Elder Vimalakirti thought, “Now Mañjusri and a great congregation is coming.”  
Then with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.

4. Mañjusri entered the house, and he saw the room was empty, with  Vimalakirti lying alone on a single couch.

### Teisho
{{< q-class "teisho" >}}
Manjusri went with many disciples and heavenly beings to visit Vimalakirti. In his house, in his small room, there was not one single thing, only Vimalakirti resting alone. There was incense burning and he was waiting for the guests. This is the "first" tearoom. No matter what wonderful tea utensils there are, they are put away and only a single flower is offered to the Buddha. Incense is also offered and nothing else is in the room. This is the rule for the host, to create a room where no random thoughts can enter. It is the clear mind of the host that prepares this room. 

["The Tea room within - Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity"](/catalogue/44).
 
Once we enter the tearoom there are only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers to be seen, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose and we taste the delicious tea.  With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, clarity and serenity are realized. The room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure and so was his heart and his mind, with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri Bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.
