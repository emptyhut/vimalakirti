The Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa (Sanskrit: विमलकीर्तिनिर्देश), (sometimes referred to as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra or Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra) is a Buddhist text which centers around a lay buddhist meditator who attained a very high degree of enlightenment considered by some second only to the Buddha's. It was extremely influential in East Asia. 

The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha,  the appearances of the world are illusionary, and the superiority of the actual practise over mere learning. The upāsaka (lay practitioner) Vimalakīrti addresses both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of śūnyatā and teaches them their failings and how they are overcome. The discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence.

Shodo Roshi taught the Sutra during sesshin (week-long meditation retreats) at Tahoma Zen Monastery each fall and spring from 2009 through 2014. Roshi taught in Japanese and translation was given by Daichi Zenni. The teisho were later transcribed and privately published in a 4 volume series.
