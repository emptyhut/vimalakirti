### Sutra

1. At this point the Buddha addressed Mañjusri, “You go inquire about Vimalakirti’s illness.”

Mañjusri addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, that superior one is difficult to respond to.  
“He has profoundly attained the true characteristic, and he is good at explaining the essentials of the Dharma.  
“His eloquence is unhampered, and his wisdom is unhindered.  
“He completely understands all the deportments of the bodhisattvas, and he has entered into all the secret storehouses of the buddhas.  
“He has subjugated the host of Maras, and disports himself in the numinous penetrations. He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means.  
“Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”

### Teisho

Even though the Buddha had requested it of them, none the disciples felt that they were able to call on Vimalakirti, having been reprimanded and cautioned by him in previous encounters. They had all been exhorted by VImalakirti to improve their training and felt they were not good enough to meet him again. So now the Buddha asks Manjusri Bodhisattva to go.

Because it was a momentous event, a large entourage of eight thousand disciples, five hundred bodhisattvas, and a hundred thousand gods and goddesses all came with Manjusri to see Vimalakirti. 

### Sutra
3. At that time the Elder Vimalakirti thought, “Now Mañjusri and a great congregation is coming.”  
Then with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.

4. Mañjusri entered the house, and he saw the room was empty, with  Vimalakirti lying alone on a single couch.

### Teisho
(move)
This empty room of Vimalakirti is said to be the source of the tea room, tea ceremony and the tea house. This way of tea ceremony, with its spare hermitage-like tea room and simple garden was begun by Tea Master Rikyu. He did long years of practice and zazen and from his deep power of vow he taught that the first priority in the training of tea is to intimately study the Dharma. He taught this himself and he was always creating a context of how it is in the zendo, and also that the tea garden should maintain the simplicity of a Zen temple garden.

This is Rikyu’s own way of teaching, and it was this very hut of Vimalakirti which was the model for Rikyu’s teahouse. When Vimalakirti took everything out of his house, leaving only one bed where he lay, this way of being is a way of expressing one’s own life. The tearoom is usually the size of four and one half tatami mats and outside of the tea room there is a small simple garden. The four and one half mat room is the size taken from the Vimalakirti Sutra; the small simple garden comes from the teaching in the Lotus sutra. The room in which Vimalakirti lived was a square, four and one half tatami sized room, and this is the same as the word for a head priest of a temple. It is a little larger than nine feet square, with the addition of the tokonoma and a wooden board; this is just the size of four and one half tatami mats.

One Buddha land. Buddha lands are not about space, but about being one complete world, three meters square. In the case of the tea room, we purify our senses before entering it, rinse our mouths, and put away our worldly thoughts and ideas. We enter the room with  a quiet focused minds. Usually, about three or four people can fit into a tea room comfortably. But if there are no mental, dualistic ideas to restrict and make it narrow, it is not difficult for a three meter square tea room to hold eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, and one hundred thousand gods and goddesses. We can all enter if we think about it. Rationally it may seem impossible. But since it is the whole great space in that room, it is an infinite size.

Manjusri went with many disciples and heavenly beings to visit Vimalakirti. In his house, in his small room, there was not one single thing, only Vimalakirti resting alone. There was incense burning and he was waiting for the guests. This is the tearoom. No matter what wonderful tea utensils there are, they are put away and only a single flower is offered to the Buddha. Incense is also offered and nothing else is in the room. This is the rule for the host, to create a room where no random thoughts can enter. It is the clear mind of the host that prepares this room. 

 At the tearoom the guests first clean their hands at the tsukubai (rock basin with water in it) in the garden. They purify their mouth and they purify their mind. Then they enter the tearoom. Rikyu has written “The small garden is the path in from the floating transient world, don’t bring in the dust from the mists of that world.” In this way Rikyu has written. When we enter the small tea garden we are no longer in that world of dualistic values of good and bad, win and lose. This is the world where everything is equal, a different world.  The pure world of the Buddha is how we must receive it. From this comes the origin of the simple tea garden. Once we enter that garden’s world we put aside all thoughts from the everyday world. This is the purified mind of the guest.
 
Once we enter the tearoom there are only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers to be seen, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose and we taste the delicious tea.  With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, clarity and serenity are realized. The room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure and so was his heart and his mind, with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri Bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.
