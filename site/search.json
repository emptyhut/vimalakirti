It was extremely influential in East Asia.\nThe sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the appearances of the world are illusionary, and the superiority of the actual practise over mere learning. The upāsaka (lay practitioner) Vimalakīrti addresses both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of śūnyatā and teaches them their failings and how they are overcome. The discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence.\nShodo Roshi taught the Sutra during sesshin (week-long meditation retreats) at Tahoma Zen Monastery each fall and spring from 2009 through 2014. Roshi taught in Japanese and translation was given by Daichi Zenni. The teisho were later transcribed and privately published in a 4 volume series.\n","id":0,"length":169,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"//localhost:1313/"},{"content":"Starting in September 2009 during the fall sesshin at Tahoma Zen Monastery, Roshi give teisho (formal lectures) on the Vimalakirti Sutra.

But more generally and properly, Shodo is the art of coordinating mind, body, and brush. In Japanese calligraphy, Chinese characters which comprise the written language of Japan are brushed with black ink on paper or silk, usually in the form of scrolls. Fluid lines create these letters through a series of dragging, pressing and sweeping actions of the brush. Once begun, each calligraphy is produced in a single moment. There is no opportunity for outlining, filling in, repairing, or augmenting ill-formed lines or characters; for one sheet of paper there is only one chance to produce a finished calligraphy. Therefore, the work must be entered with a settled mind and executed with unfaltering confidence.\nTraining in the art of calligraphy involves practice in ink preparation, brush stroke technique, the shape and construction of letters, and placement and spacing of the characters on the sheet. Yet technical facility is not the primary measure of great calligraphic art. The work of calligraphy masters is suffused with spirit, ki, the direct expression of mind and energy. This quality is perceptible in the strength and fluidity of the lines and characters produced. It is also visible at a microscopic level in the alignment of the ink particles (bokhi) in the brushed lines.\n  Jikishin kore jodo - 直心是浄土  Calligraphy and Zen The calligraphic line is a lasting trace of the mind that produced it. The quality of the line reflects the mind of the calligrapher in the moment of executing the brush stroke. It cannot be otherwise, Harada Roshi says.\nThe calligrapher becomes one with the brush in the moment of executing each line.\nOmori Sogen, a 20th centery Zen master, puts it like this: “For a line to be properly composed, the mind must be composed.” The emphasis is on focusing all of one’s attention on the act of writing. Zen calligrapher Terayama Katsujo comments, “What matters above all is the utilization of the entire body and mind in the ‘here’ and ‘now’. The problem is not ‘How to write beautifully’, but rather ‘How to be awakened through writing.’” Realizing what is in the here and now as distinct from what has been in the past or will be in the future, what might be expected, feared, or hoped for: that is the task. The present moment contains all that is, even as it is fleeting and incapable of being held onto. The trace, left by the ink on the brush in the moment of creation, is an impression of the mind that produced it in that instant.\nProfessional calligrapher Gochiku puts it this way: “Technical skill comes from training with a brush, while the heart of a work comes from training the mind.” Since alignment of mind is the province of Zen meditation, the link between Shodo and Zen is strong. In fact, there is a specific term, Zenga, to denote Zen Buddhist calligraphy and brush painting. In zenga, the strict aesthetic rules that govern non-Buddhist calligraphy are disregarded. The message, expressing the state of mind of liberation, is what is of primary importance. Often, letters and images are combined in the same piece.\nAll of the zen arts and zen meditation are intended to focus attention on the present moment. Through the practice and mastery of zen meditation, the mind is emptied of extraneous thoughts and preoccupations; constraints of attachment are shed. When we are not pulled around by our thoughts and emotions or stuck on our attachments, our perspective broadens beyond our personal concerns, and our responsiveness increases. The expression on paper becomes unhesitating and spontaneous.\nHarada Roshi emphasizes that “the essential way of being and the true way of seeing” enable free-flowing and harmonious expression in all the arts, including calligraphy, tea ceremony, ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement), kudo (archery), or kendo (swordsmanship). This immediate and direct expression can only be achieved when ego filters and ideas of a self are cast aside and we become one with the whole universe.\nThus, the practices of Zen meditation and Japanese calligraphy complement each other. Many Zen masters have become accomplished calligraphers. Some, like Omori Sogen, use Shodo as a form of Zen practice; some employ the calligraphies as a teaching device and a link to Zen history and wisdom.\nHakuin Zenji, an eighteenth century Rinzai Zen master of profound depth and energy, is perhaps the most famous Zen calligrapher and exemplar of zenga. He left a huge number of calligraphies, many of which combined letters and images in the same work, even using stylized letters or characters to denote representational images. Harada Roshi notes that in Hakuin’s case, calligraphy is truly an extension of his single-minded vow to liberate all sentient beings. He wanted to pass this message on and used his letters to touch as many people as he could.\nCalligraphy, content and context Phrases on calligraphy scrolls most often represent familiar sayings, poems, or koans from Zen wisdom or Japanese literature. Frequently the sayings reflect images of nature in the seasons and their metaphoric relationship to states of mind. Other frequent images on scrolls include nature landscapes and common Zen symbols such as ensos (circles), staffs, and images of Bodhidharma, the founding patriarch of Zen.\nKoans are puzzling questions or paradoxical problems taken from comments or conversations of the ancient Zen masters, which have been cataloged and kept alive over the centuries. In the Rinzai tradition, Zen students are asked to meditate on a koan from morning to night, night until morning, until they become one with it. The “solution” is not an intellectual understanding of the problem but a direct experience of its truth. Writing the koans calligraphically is sometimes done as a meditation: a way of focusing body, mind, and spirit on the words, images and feelings of the koan. When the student approaches the paper with ‘no-mind’ (mu-shin) and becomes one with the brush and the characters and the koan, the “answer” to the koan may be revealed; simultaneously, a powerful calligraphy is produced. The qualities of fluidity, firmness, and vigor are seen in the lines, and the qualities of spaciousness and balance are evident in and between the characters on the sheet. There is a merging of self and koan. It is the manifestation of oneness that is at the heart of Zen.\nJust as koan study is a meditation tool, another is being in the presence of nature and all that surrounds us. Sayings and poems that focus on observations of nature and truth in nature direct the attention of calligrapher and audience alike to the natural world and the present moment within it. Further, these calligraphies pay homage to the wisdom of the ancient poets even as they become the object for being in the here-and-now with ink and brush and paper. A frequent image of Zen calligraphers, including Harada Roshi, is the enso, a circle that visually reveals both totality and void, wholeness and emptiness. Rather than being opposites, these characteristics merge into something singular and indissoluble: seeming dualities merge into Oneness, the basic tenet of Zen, in this single linear form. And like Zen practice, the process of producing that simple line to create a fluid, vigorous, and harmonious image is not easy. Scrolls are traditionally mounted on silk and hung in temples, tea rooms, and individuals’ homes, often in tokonomas (alcove). At times in Japanese history, statues and images of Buddha were outlawed in an attempt to discourage the practice of Zen. Calligraphy scrolls hung in tokonomas came to represent the Buddha, and this practice continues today.\nUnlike much of western art, fixed in frames and permanently hung, a Japanese calligraphy is frequently displayed for a particular occasion or for a season and then replaced or rotated with other scrolls. This aspect of Japanese calligraphy is consistent with other zen arts including flower arrangement and tea ceremony with the emphasis on freshness and attention to the constantly changing natural world.\nCalligraphy has always played a role in Japanese tea ceremony. This ceremony is a formalized practice of serving and receiving matcha, whisked Japanese green tea, in an intimate setting. Typically, the ceremony is conducted in a small and spare room, measured to accommodate four and one-half tatami mats, bare except for tea making implements and a large niche or tokonoma. In the tokonoma is a single flower and a scroll, each appropriate to the current event or season. Everything in the small space is designed to direct the participants’ attention to the present moment: the warm, fragrant tea presented in a handmade bowl with its particular visual and tactile characteristics; the sweet and bitter tastes of the confection and the tea itself; the movements, sounds and gestures of the host and guests and the interaction between and among them.\nEarlier it was mentioned that each calligraphy is rendered in a single moment\u0026ndash;a moment in which the calligrapher becomes one with the brush. It is this immediacy that the calligraphy at its best can translate to the viewer: an opportunity to be in the moment and at one with the image as you experience it. This book of Shodo Harada Roshi’s work is offered in that spirit. Read it continuously, or open it randomly when it calls to you. Either way, the hope is that you will encounter the feeling and energy that is central to Shodo Harada Roshi’s mastery of shodo. His calligraphies, along with his wise commentaries on the subjects depicted, reflect the spirit and delight at the heart of his approach to zen; and they are an invitation to explore life lived unencumbered by presumption and expectation\u0026ndash;lived in the living.

The Buddha would teach in very simple, direct phrases that would touch each person in a different way. For example, upon hearing “All is empty,” a greedy person becomes terribly melancholy, thinking how sad it is that all these things he wants are after all empty. Those who are unlucky in whatever they do, for whom nothing comes out right no matter how they try it, might think, “Well that’s all right! If all is empty after all, it must be so hard for everyone! There’s no need to be so upset about it!” The very ambitious would hear “All is empty” and know that even if they have great prosperity and have gathered great wealth they will eventually die and see that none of it has any meaning. It gives them a chill. They see that they must help others and do something differently. Each person hears this one simple sentence directly put by the Buddha and feels it in a very different way.

He had already made offerings to immeasurable buddhas, deeply planting the foundation of goodness. He had attained forbearance of the nonarising [of dharmas], and his eloquence was unhindered. He disported in the numinous penetrations and had achieved all the dhāraṇīs. He had attained fearlessness and had subjugated the troubling vengeance of the Māras. Entering into [all the] gates of profound Dharma, he was excellent at the perfection of wisdom. Having penetrated skillful means, his great vows had been accomplished.\nUnderstanding the tendencies of the minds of sentient beings, he was also able to discriminate between those of sharp and dull faculties. Long [a practitioner of] the path of buddhahood, his mind was already pure, and he was deﬁnitively [dedicated to] the Mahayana. He considered well the activities of the realms of existence, and, residing in the deportment of the Buddha, his mind was great as the ocean. The buddhas praised him [as their] disciple, and the Indras, Brahmās, and world lords (i.e., heavenly kings) revered him.\nWanting to save people, [Vimalakīrti] used his excellent skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī, where with wealth immeasurable he attracted the poor, with the purity of his morality he attracted the miscreants, with the moderation of his forbearance he attracted the angry, with great exertion he attracted the indolent, with singleminded concentration he attracted the perturbed, and with deﬁnitive wisdom he attracted the foolish.\nAlthough he was a white-robed [layman], he maintained the pure Vinaya conduct of a śramaṇa; although he resided in the home, he was not attached to the triple world. He manifested the existence of wife and sons, but always cultivated chastity. He revealed the existence of subordinates, but always enjoyed transcendence. Although his clothing was richly decorated, it was with the marks and features [of a Tathāgata] that he adorned his body. Although he drank and ate, the joy of concentration was his [favorite] ﬂavor. If he went to gambling houses or theaters it was only to save people. He hosted those of the heretic paths without breaking his correct faith. Although he illuminated the profane classics he always took pleasure in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all as the one most worthy of offerings.\nTeisho When we only do what we think benefits or profits us, we seldom use our huge potential or access our deep character. That which we don’t like, we don’t feel like doing. If we become too full of delusions, we can clear those away by doing the deep breathing of susokkan. Instead of becoming so irritable and so aggravated, we do our breathing, extending each exhalation. We expand widely—and we are able to reach a place where we become quiet. Realizing how this works, we do it some more, and clarify further, knowing a greater breath and a greater depth of Mind.\nWe are always wanting to control others; this is an expression of one kind of fear. We have to liberate ourselves from this fear. If we align our state of mind, that fear naturally goes away and new wisdom can then come forth. We have all kinds of fantasies and ideas that obstruct us—to let go of all of those is what Vimalakirti knew how to do.\nHe had a deep wisdom that was free from any small-self filter. He could see the best way to be. After we align our awareness—we do susokkan deeply and go to where there is nothing left to be caught on, for everything is all wide open—we become this openness and then we can receive everything. We know from deep within the four Bodhisattva Vows that sentient beings are numberless, and yet no matter how impossibly difficult it is to liberate so many, we vow we will do that impossible thing.\nReferences [4][chapter 2]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

He knew that excellent creations are not all there is to life. Beyond delusion there is deep Mind, which unites all of us through every era. He saw this clearly and knew that this world is the source of the whole great universe. We have to see this and return to this place, and for doing this we have zazen.\nIn order to see this—that there is nothing in existence that is of a fixed, permanent form and that all things are phenomena—we have to first recognize that everything around us is always changing and then realize deeply and clearly what does not change. We do zazen in order to do that. We put aside the things that are moving so quickly in society, and we are able to better realize that place which is slightly different, which isn’t always only involved in that ongoing change.\nWith Vimalakirti’s teaching, we see how to go about helping humans realize that pure mind.

Why? I remember once in the past, when I was begging in a poor neighborhood, Vimalakīrti came and said to me, “‘Kāśyapa, while abiding in the Dharma of universal sameness, you should proceed in sequence in your begging.\n“‘It is because of not eating that you should practice begging.\n“‘It is because of the destruction of one’s physical integrity that you should take that lump of food. It is because of not receiving that you should receive that food.\n“‘You should enter a village with the idea that it is an empty aggregation\n“‘The forms you see are equivalent to [what] the blind [see]; the sounds you hear are equivalent to echoes; the fragrances you smell are equivalent to the wind; the ﬂavors you eat should not be discriminated; your tactile sensations are like the realizations of wisdom; and you should understand that the dharmas are like phantasms. That which is without self-nature and without other-nature originally was not burning and will not become extinguished now.\n“‘Kāśyapa, if you are able to enter the eight emancipations without renouncing the eight perversions, using the characteristic of perversion to enter into the correct Dharma, and using a single meal to give to all, making offerings to the buddhas and the assembly of worthies and sages—only then should you eat.\n“‘To eat in this fashion is neither to have the afﬂictions nor to transcend the afﬂictions, it is neither to enter into concentration nor to arise from concentration, it is neither to abide in the world nor to abide in nirvana.\n“‘Where there is charity, there are neither great nor small blessings, neither beneﬁt nor harm. This is the correct entry into the path of buddhahood, without relying on the śrāvaka[vehicle].\n“‘Kāśyapa, if you can eat according to this [understanding] then you will not render void the charity of those who feed you.’  Teisho In the dojo, before we eat we chant sutras, recognizing that we receive our food from people in society in order to realize our training in its deepest way. We cannot be greedy—this is the teaching of our practice. As our practice continues, we have to make ongoing creative and inventive efforts to live according to our path—not living acccording to our desires but offering everything that we are and that we have to this path. Even if sometimes we are without the things we would prefer to eat, we will not go hungry. With our wisdom and with others’ kindness and offerings, we will be taken care of and receive blessings. If we are practicing our Path correctly, the necessary support will come to us without fail.\nBefore we eat our meals, we always make a saba offering. We do this remembering those who have no food that day, and also for those beings of no form who are nonetheless hungry in Mind. Only after making this offering do we ourselves eat. This is how we eat our meals in the dojo. Of course, we eat because we are hungry, and we are not trying to lose all desires for food. This is not about making our lives more difficult and then calling that practice. Rather, it is about eating humbly and not being greedy in satisfying our desires. Entering samadhi and forgetting society is not the point, nor is the point to enter society and forget our quiet within. The point is not to be drowned in society’s conditions, nor to drown in quietude and forget society’s needs. While not living in the midst of society, neither have we thrown away society. Every day we live in this way. This is the way of the Mahayana, the Path of the Mahayana, and this is the path to realize our true and original Mind. When we awaken to this we will naturally live in this way.\nReferences [6][chapter 3]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Why?\n“I remember once in the past, there were two bhikṣus who had violated the practice of the Vinaya but from their shame did not dare ask you about it. They came to ask me: ‘O Upāli, we have violated the Vinaya and are sincerely ashamed, not daring to ask the Buddha about it. We want you to explain our doubts and the [need for] repentance, so that we may be relieved of the transgressions.’ I immediately explained [the matter] to them according to the Dharma.\n  “At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me, “‘O Upāli, do not increase these two bhikṣus’ transgressions. You should just remove [the transgressions] and not disturb their minds. Why?\n“‘The nature of those transgressions does not reside within, it does not reside without, and it does not reside in the middle.\n“‘As the Buddha has explained, when their minds reside without, and it does not reside in the middle.\n“‘As the Buddha has explained, when their minds are deﬁled, sentient beings are deﬁled. When their minds are puriﬁed, sentient beings are puriﬁed. The mind likewise does not reside within, does not reside without, and does not reside in the middle. Just so is the mind, and just so are transgression and deﬁlement. The dharmas are also likewise, in not transcending suchness.\n“‘Just so, Upāli, when one attains emancipation using the characteristics of the mind, is it (i.e., the mind) deﬁled or not?’ I said, ‘It is not.’\n“Vimalakīrti said, ‘The characteristics of the minds of all sentient beings are likewise, in being without deﬁlement.\n  “‘O Upāli, to have false concepts is deﬁlement; to be without false concepts is purity.\n“‘Confusion is deﬁlement, and the absence of confusion is purity. “‘To grasp the self is deﬁlement, and not to grasp the self is purity.\n“‘Upāli, all the dharmas are generated and extinguished, without abiding. Like phantasms or lightning bolts, the dharmas do not depend on each other. They do not abide even for a single instant. The dharmas are all false views, like a dream, like a mirage, like the moon [reﬂected] in water, like an image in a mirror—[all] generated from false conceptualization. Those who understand this are called “upholders of the Vinaya.” Those who understand this are said to “understand well.”’\n  Teisho Upali had been teaching two monks the practice of repenting, when along came Vimalakirti, saying that what Upali was teaching them was going to make things worse and lead to even more mistakes. Unless the monks saw the true source of their mistaken behavior, it was all useless. And then Vimalakirti taught Upali of the true repentance.\nOn top of having made a mistake, to bring forth the idea that there is an “I” who made the mistake is adding on yet another mistake. You have to teach people to recognize the source of their mistakes, or they will make an even bigger mistake; they will never truly apprehend their mind’s true base. In today’s world, where we generally punish mistakes, this is very hard to grasp. Vimalakirti is saying that what we need to do is not punish but educate.\nExamining and reviewing our past behavior is essential to all religions. We are all constantly making mistakes and behaving unskillfully. So we declare our commitment to change our behavior in front of the Buddha. There is a particular repentance verse for this, and there is a way of chanting the names of all of the three thousand Buddhas, prostrating at each name, for a total of three thousand prostrations. It takes about one week to complete this ceremony. We chant the Buddha’s name while we put our forehead to the floor, bend our back, and actualize that repentance. In doing this, we declare and own our mistakes. This is what is called the repentance of form.\nBut even though we actively repent with the body, the mind is the source of our mistaken behavior, and so we have to also repent our mind’s way of having expressed itself. The best way of doing this is zazen. If you want to truly review and change your behavior, then sit with a straight back, and sit free of any bit of obstruction in your clear mind. You then will realize how all mistaken behavior comes from a murky, occluded state of mind. This is like the clouds in the dark, dark sky. When the morning sun shines through those clouds, all the darkness is dispelled and everything becomes radiant. It is the same in our mind. When the true light of clarity comes, all the clouds and murkiness are dispelled. Zazen is not just about doing koans or sitting, but about clarifying our truest state of mind. This is about being in that clarified state of mind, from morning until night and night until morning in all the positions of sitting, standing, lying down, getting up, walking—all day long, we continue. This is what it is to live. This is zazen.\nReferences [7, 8, 9] [chapter 3]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Why? I remember once in the past when I was explaining the practice of the stage of irreversibility for the heavenly king of the Tuṣita Heaven and his subordinates. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,\n“‘Maitreya, the World-honored One has bestowed on your noble person the prediction that you will achieve anuttarā samyak saṃbodhiin a single lifetime. What lifetime will you use to experience this prediction, past, future, or present? If a past life, then the past life is already extinguished. If a future life, then the future life has not arrived. If the present life, then the present life is nonabiding. It is as the Buddha has explained, “O bhikṣus, you are in this immediate present born, aged, and extinguished.”\n“‘If you experience this prediction with birthlessness, then the birthless is the primary status [of Hinayanist enlightenment]. Yet within that primary status there is no receiving the prediction, and also no attainment of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.\n“‘How, Maitreya, did you receive the prediction of [buddhahood in] a single lifetime? Did you receive the prediction from the generation of suchness, or did you receive the prediction from the extinction of suchness? “‘If you received the prediction by the generation of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without generation. If you received the prediction by the extinction of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without extinction.\n“‘All sentient beings are entirely suchlike, and all dharmas are also entirely suchlike. The assembly of sages and wise ones are also suchlike. Even you, Maitreya, are suchlike. If you received the prediction [of future buddhahood], all sentient beings should also receive it. Why? Suchness is nondual and nondifferentiated. If Maitreya attains anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, then all sentient beings should also all attain it. Why? All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi.\nIf Maitreya attains extinction, then all sentient beings should also all [attain] extinction. Why? The buddhas understand that all sentient beings are ultimately extinguished, which is the characteristic of nirvana, and cannot again be extinguished.\n“‘Therefore, Maitreya, do not inspire the gods with this teaching.\nTeisho Here we have this teaching of Vimalakirti on nonabiding. We think that awakening can be left for the future, but that is not possible. Awakening is only possible in this present moment. It makes no sense to claim that we will be able to experience awakening in a moment of the past or in a moment of the future. We can only be sharp and awake and ready in this very present moment. However, if that past is clarified and we are not caught on a hope of awakening in the future, then we are more likely to be able to sharpen in this present moment. If it is something we hold in our imagination or feel in a vague way like a memory, we are only imagining the superficial thing.\nYou must not cease in your constant, focused application. Even a small bit of water falling one drop at a time, such as water dripping from the eaves onto a stone below, wears away the stone drop by drop. Each time you look away from the present and say to yourself, “Oh I wish it were like this” or “Oh why can’t it be just like that,” the essence will get diluted until you’ve let go of it completely. It is just like making a spark with two sticks. We rub the sticks together and keep rubbing without stopping to get the heat that can then bring forth a spark. Then finally, with the friction of the sticks rubbing against each other there will be smoke, and the spark will come forth and start the paper scraps burning, and a fire can be built. If you are always stopping and resting as you do it, no matter how great a deep vow you have, the goal will not be realized. To do it without ceasing and to keep the efforts going all the way to completion is what is called making true efforts\nReferences [10][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”  Teisho Vimalakirti tells Maitreya that we are all undivided and without dualism in our mind from the origin, so we do not need to make efforts to become that way. In the beginning, all people are clear. But if we have added things on, believing we are of this quality and have that characteristic, we need to let go of those deluded ideas. To do that we have to make great efforts, not to become that clear mind but to let go of what we have constructed and added on to the clear mind that is already there.\nThus Vimalakirti tells us: Do not add on any ideas about what it is to awaken. Do not hold on to anything called an awakening. Do not be attached to anything whatsoever. Do not add second associations and third associations to direct perceptions. Do not hold on to any idea about how hard you are working. That is all extra. Just sit without being caught on an idea of sitting, an idea of doing the practice, an idea of doing anything. Those ideas are what make it so difficult. Don’t give in to making extra associations to whatever you perceive. Just as water flows freely, moving past huge boulders or the roots of tree trunks, when we are free from being caught on anything at all, everything we see, hear, and feel is then the truth, because we are not caught on our ideas about things that we are perceiving and experiencing or by our second associations to those ideas.

A dojo is usually understood as a place of practice, a place where monks train. Sogenji, for example, is considered a dojo. However, Vimalakirti, teaching of the Mahayana, is not talking about a dojo as a location or a place where monks with shaved heads live in a cloistered area. Rather, he is telling us to not give rise to any unnecessary thoughts, even while in the very midst of life—a family life, a life in the world. This is the truer meaning of a dojo, a place where we never leave the truth and we never separate from the practice.\nA dojo is not a location or a place, but a state of mind where we do not let go of our practice, where we are not entertaining extraneous thinking. From morning until night, night until morning, our state of mind cannot be stopped or caught, but must be without gaps and without pauses. This is because in our everyday life and work, that living, flowing state of mind enables us to see how best to do things: to make decisions and act in a natural way that results in the best work. Unless we carefully stay in this fresh, ongoing flow, we get caught. We get out of bed, we do chanting, we do zazen, we do sanzen, we clean, we eat, without stopping in between. We continue without a break, and as we get used to it we see this is the best way to live and to work. When we are taking a rest, we rest completely. When we are working, we work totally and completely. The deep profound mind is the dojo.\nThe dojo is that very determination to put others’ liberation ahead of our own. Working for others without ceasing, we are simultaneously polishing our own deepest wisdom and state of mind. We vow to offer our lives to everyone, while continuing to polish and deepen our own understanding. This is the deep vow of the bodhisattva. The dojo is the honest mind. The dojo is the purified mind. The dojo is the mind of offering all for the liberation of other beings, even ahead of our own deep liberation. All of these being realized is the dojo. Deepen to the place where you are practicing continuously, without any sense of even practicing. This state of mind in which being empathetic and compassionate with all living beings is your prime concern— this is the way of the bodhisattva, and this state of mind is the dojo.\nReferences [12][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

We continue without a break, and as we get used to it we see this is the best way to live and to work. When we are taking a rest, we rest completely. When we are working, we work totally and completely. The deep profound mind is the dojo.\nThe dojo is that very determination to put others’ liberation ahead of our own. Working for others without ceasing, we are simultaneously polishing our own deepest wisdom and state of mind. We vow to offer our lives to everyone, while continuing to polish and deepen our own understanding. This is the deep vow of the bodhisattva. The dojo is the honest mind. The dojo is the purified mind. The dojo is the mind of offering all for the liberation of other beings, even ahead of our own deep liberation. All of these being realized is the dojo. Deepen to the place where you are practicing continuously, without any sense of even practicing. This state of mind in which being empathetic and compassionate with all living beings is your prime concern— this is the way of the bodhisattva, and this state of mind is the dojo.\nReferences [12, 13][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

The usual pleasures of the world arise from something external, such as listening to music. But dharma joy comes forth from within. Dancing from our utmost inner joy, when we cannot help but dance, is not the same thing as dancing to the sound of an external musical instrument. The same is true with the singing that wells up from deep inside us out of our great joy.\nWe all have this deeper joy, but because we are always looking externally, we don’t realize this state of mind. As Dogen has said, if we are simple and natural in mind, we perceive with our senses, and this joy is a matter of course. We have the sun that rises in the east and the moon that sets in the west. We have the cocks that crow at dawn, and every four years we have a leap year. The joy of these proceeding in their natural order is the dharma joy. The inner joy of the sangha is knowing that the deep True mind is present in all people. There is no one who is not endowed from the origin with this clear mind. There is no difference in the depth of mind of any person, and we live in the joy of knowing that truth.\nReferences [14][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

The inexhaustible lamp is like a lamp that ignites a hundred thousand lamps, illuminating all darkness with an illumination that is never exhausted. Thus, sisters, if a single bodhisattva guides a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi,that bodhisattva’s intention to achieve enlightenment will also never be extinguished.\n“‘With each teaching of the Dharma all the good dharmas are naturally increased. This is what is called the “inexhaustible lamp.” Although you reside in Māra’s palace, with this inexhaustible lamp you can cause innumerable gods and goddesses to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Thereby you will repay the Buddha’s kindness and also greatly beneﬁt all sentient beings.’  Teisho Once we have realized this truth, how can we can live in the world of so many external pleasures and still keep this greater truth alive? How can we keep it in mind? If we return to a world of desire and pleasure, we might forget what we have learned. In response to this question, Vimalakirti, gave the teaching of the inexhaustible lamp. Just as the flame of one lamp can touch and light hundreds and then thousands of other lamps, so our awakening to the truth brings the same awakening to many others’ minds as well.\nBecause others don’t yet know the truth, we must share this light so that a hundred to a thousand to ten thousand will also be able to realize it as well. For the bodhisattva’s light of truth to shine brightly, we have to continually make all possible efforts. We have to bring this truth to all people, and then you will not fall again into superficial reliance on external pleasures. He tells them to hold this teaching precious and share what they have learned with all others.\nReferences [15][chapter 4]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means. “Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”\nThereupon the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indras, Brahmās, and the four heavenly kings in the assembly all thought, “Now these two great bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī and Vimalakīrti will have a discussion. They will certainly explain a wondrous Dharma.”\nAt the time eight thousand bodhisattvas, ﬁve hundred śrā vakas, and a hundred thousand gods all wanted to follow along. Mañjuśrī and the congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples, with the gods reverentially surrounding them, then entered the great city of Vaiśālī.\nAt that time the Elder Vimalakīrti thought, “Now Mañjuśrī and a great congregation is coming.” Then with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.  Teisho When we enter the tea room, we see only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose, and we taste the delicious tea. With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, pruity, and tranquility are realized.\nThe room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure, and so were his heart and his mind; with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha, he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.\nVimalakirti is the one who gave birth to the tea room garden, a small garden outside the tea room that is like the one written about in the Vimalakirti Sutra. Vimalakirti’s room is called a hojo. It is the size of four and one half tatami mats, just big enough for a human to live in the least possible space. Vimalakirti was sick in such a room when Manjusri came to visit with many Bodhisattvas, but there was nothing at all in the room. Vimalakirti was just burning incense and waiting. In the tea ceremony as well, nothing extra is added. There is only the fragrance of incense and flowers; everything else is empty. Thus is the empty mind of the tea master expressed. The guests purify themselves by washing their hands at the rock basin and then enter with a purified mind.\nAt the doorway to the tea ceremony room a fan is placed on the tatami, marking a definite entrance. Then we go to the tokonoma, the place where even in a regular house we find a space for our mind to become settled. Our house is a place to rest our tired body, but it also has to be a place to find peace and a settled mind. The One Drop Zendos are also places where we can respect each other and find peace. The tokonoma was originally a Buddha altar, and that is why incense is offered to the Buddha’s words that hang there, and light is provided to light those words and our travel. To the right is a candle, to the left is water, and in the middle is an incense burner.\nHung in the middle of the tokonoma are the Buddha’s or Patriarchs’ phrases. They always hang there, providing a place of refuge for our mind. The words are a resting place, a staff for our mind, so we can sit down silently. In the tea room the tokonoma is for bowing to and honoring, not as a matter of form but from the true depths of our mind. If we always do that with respect for all people who share this same deep mind, we will all be awakened to that. Then we look at each tea utensil very seriously, examining it and seeing the value in each one. The beauty and the flavor of each has to be looked at carefully to see its highest quality. We can’t just look vaguely; there is no exchange of mind in that.\nA scholar of justice once said to his students, “Do you know that justice and law are the most feared subjects? But they are only about respecting society and the people in it, not about studying punishment. You have to see all things clearly before you start this study. Go and see things that were used as tools before the time of Christ, look at things in the museums and how they were used. You have to learn how to see things deeply. If you can’t pray for the best for society, you can’t understand justice. We have to study all things and see them well to know what will be useful and best for each person.”\nWe look carefully at each individual tea bowl. We touch the life energy of one flower in a vase. We smell the incense and feel the warmth of the water, and there our very mind’s depth is warmed as well. Not as things but as real live people we greet these utensils, and our deep respect grows and is cultivated. As we give our mind to each and every thing, we know the source of peace and harmony. It is not only about respecting people and character, but so often we can’t even do that. We are always judging the ways of others or their past deeds or their bad habits. We are always looking at their weaknesses. But if we do that we can’t truthfully respect them. As Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva did, we have to let go of all ideas of good and bad before we can truly respect someone, and we can’t enter the tea room sincerely unless we are peaceful in our own mind. We must have a mind like a mirror that simply reflects and does not judge. Then we can see in the same way as God, who gives rain equally to good people and bad, and realize that we have that very same mind inside us.\nWhen we let go of everything we have accumulated, we can see directly what is actually there. Then we can use our experiences and knowledge without mistake, for all beings and for all of society. For this we have to purify that mind, this clear “Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.”\nAs the Buddha said, we have to extinguish the flames of greed, extinguish the flames of ignorance, and extinguish the flames of anger, and then we will know nirvana’s tranquillity. If we realize the true source of our mind, we know this pure and clear place, and from there we respect all beings. This is the source of peace for the whole world.\n“Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.”\nNot just for tea ceremony, but as the source of peace for all humankind.\nReferences Bibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

You have come with the characteristic of not coming; you see with the characteristic of not seeing.”\nMañjuśrī said, “So it is, retired scholar. If one has come, there is no more coming. If one has gone, there is no more going. Why? To come is to come from nowhere; to go is to proceed nowhere. That which can be seen is then invisible. “But enough of this matter. Retired scholar, can this illness be forborn? In its treatment is it diminished, so as not to increase? The World-honored One has made immeasurable courteous inquiries about you. “Retired scholar, what is the cause from which this illness arises? Has it been affecting you long? How will it be extinguished?\nVimalakīrti said, “From stupidity there is affection, and hence the generation of my illness (or: the illness of self). Since all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why? Bodhisattvas enter samsara on behalf of sentient beings. Because there is samsara, there is illness. If sentient beings were able to transcend illness, then bodhisattvas would not also be ill. “It is like an elder whose only son becomes ill, and the parents become ill as well. If the son recovers from the illness, the parents also recover. Bodhisattvas are like this. They have affection for sentient beings as if for their own children. When sentient beings are ill the bodhisattvas are ill also, and when sentient beings recover from their illness the bodhisattvas recover also.”\nHe also said, “From what cause does this illness arise? The illness of bodhisattvas arises from great compassion.” Mañjuśrī said, “Retired scholar, why is this room empty, with no servants?”\nVimalakīrti said, “The countries of the buddhas are also all empty.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked, “With what was it emptied?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It was emptied with emptiness.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “How can emptiness use emptiness?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It is empty through nondiscriminating emptiness.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Can emptiness be discriminated?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “Discrimination is also empty.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should emptiness be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It should be sought within the sixty-two [heterodox] views.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should the sixty-two views be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “They should be sought within the emancipation of the buddhas.”\n[Mañjuśrī] asked further, “Where should the emancipation of the buddhas be sought?”\n[Vimalakīrti] answered, “It should be sought within the mental processes of all sentient beings.”  Teisho When Manjusri entered Vimalakirti’s room, it was empty of furnishings except for one bed. The state of mind of satori was overflowing everywhere. Vimalakirti welcomed him: “You did well to come, Manjusri, and even though you come, there is no coming. No sense of your having come. Nor is there any awareness in your mind of having arrived. Who appears is not to be seen.” When we visit someone and are wondering what to say, we are lost in delusion. Without thought, everything is huge and natural. It is not about wondering in advance what kind of greetings to make. This is how Manjusri came, totally naturally, and how Vimalakirti perceived, welcomed, and responded to him. This unattached way of seeing is the state of mind of satori.\nZen is not materialism, nor is it idealism. That which is being seen and that which is seeing it are one, a perfectly matched whole. In this the actuality is manifested; the world, as it is, is me. The world and I are not separate; there is no such division. When I see the world, where I am is clear, but if I don’t see it, then where am I? Where does the world go? If “I” don’t see the world, there is no “I.” This is the state of mind of zazen, the actuality, the world of Buddha nature and our original face.\nReferences [17][chapter 5]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

However, the illnesses of sentient beings arise from the four elements, and because they are ill I am ill.”  Teisho Manjusri asks Vimalakirti what type of sickness he is suffering from. Vimalakirti replies that the wounded state of society is the cause of his illness. A doctor can tell us if an illness has to do with our stomach, our kidneys, or our liver, but the body is not the cause of sickness in this case. Vimalakirti’s sickness has no form. Vimalakirti has forgotten his body, so physical symptoms are not present. And as for the cause being mental, our mind is like waves on the ocean, so how can that which is always changing be sick? It may look bad for a moment, but then that changes immediately. In one mind moment we may be happy and joyful, but then that changes as well.

Wisdom is something like a mother in a store with her child who is demanding that his mother buy a certain thing, even if he has to scream and shout until she finally gives up and does it. But a wise mother will simply, quickly, turn the child’s attention to something completely different. And suddenly the child will have totally forgotten that he was upset, and what he was upset about. Suddenly the crying stops while the new external interest is explored. We have to be able to liberate ourselves from the thoughts that we are caught on, or we cannot liberate others.\nReferences [21][chapter 6]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Sumeru, king of mountains, will remain in appearance as before, and the gods of the [heavens of the four heavenly kings and the Trayastriṃśa [Heaven] will not sense or know their own entry [into the mustard seed]. Only those one is trying to save will see Sumeru enter into the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the teaching of inconceivable emancipation.\n  “Also, [a bodhisattva] may cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single pore.\n“[The bodhisattva does so] without discomforting the ﬁsh, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the fundamental characteristics of those great oceans [remain] as before. The dragons, demonic spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into the single pore]. At this, the sentient beings [just mentioned] are not discomforted.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva residing in inconceivable emancipation who eradicates grasping of the great trimegachiliocosm does so just like a potter grasping a wheel in his right palm: were he to throw it past world-systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, the sentient beings within [that great trimegachiliocosm] would be unaware of where they had gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them would have any conception of having gone and returned, and the fundamental characteristics of this world-system would be as before.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire kalpa and cause those sentient beings to consider it a kalpa. If there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire kalpainto seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.\n  “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation can assemble the ornaments of all the buddha lands in a single country to manifest them to sentient beings.\n“Furthermore, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and ﬂy to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.\n“Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can make visible in a single pore all the articles offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions. Also, he can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions. “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can without physical harm inhale through the mouth all the winds of the worlds in the ten directions, and the trees outside [the bodhisattva] will not be damaged [by the winds].\n  Teisho If we simply open our mind to this truth of the Mahayaha, we can see what Vimalakirti is saying here. A parable in the Bible expresses this as well: “Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.” The seed is encased in a hard shell, just like the hard shell of ego that surrounds us. The shell needs to break for the seed to germinate and produce new life. Likewise, when a mother hen produces an egg and sits on it, if the shell is not broken through, the life inside that egg dies and rots. We all have this shell of an ego, and then zazen breaks through that shell and gives birth to our true self.\nSo how does this shell break? If we live for small and selfish goals it won’t break. But if we live for all beings, it naturally breaks away because that is not ego. Of course everyone naturally wants to be awakened from the origin. We understand this, and we also understand how, at about twenty months of age, we begin thinking in terms of two, not one. Because of that, an ego comes forth and we use that ego to learn and evolve and make a life. But also because of that understanding of two, there is conflict. To liberate ourselves from this dualism we have to give birth to a new wisdom, and there is always friction in doing this. As long as we continue protecting our small self, we will never break through that shell. We have to decide to use the infinite great energy with which we are endowed from the origin in order to awaken and to awaken all beings. Not just humans, but all life energy. It’s all one life. When we are separate and isolated we feel powerless, but when we connect and unite and know our oneness directly we know how to go beyond that powerlessness and awaken all beings.\nReferences [22][Chapter 6]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

This is the truest compassion. It’s not about having some special idea or intention involved with that giving. This true compassion is something we all have. It resembles wanting to give something from an egoistic expectation and intention, and maybe this is not a bad thing, but to spontaneously give without any agenda is the natural compassion. They look similar but they are not the same; it is about whether the ego is involved or not involved.\nIf a person is suffering, then we need to respond intuitively and directly to that suffering, and in that there is no past, present, and future. In this kind of deep compassion and love it’s not about time. And we don’t need to be accepted or thanked for our help. The bodhisattva is always in equilibrium, and there can be no conflict in our mind when we are manifesting and coming forth from true compassion. This is what Vimalakirti is saying.

When the ﬂowers reached the bodhisattvas they all immediately fell off, but when they reached the great disciples they adhered and did not fall off. Even using all their numinous powers, the disciples were unable to remove the ﬂowers.\n  At that time, the goddess asked Śāriputra, “Why would you remove the ﬂowers?”\n  [Śāriputra] answered, “These ﬂowers are contrary to the Dharma, so I would remove them.”\nThe goddess said, “Do not say that these ﬂowers are contrary to the Dharma! Why? These ﬂowers are without discrimination. Sir, it is you who are generating discriminative thoughts. If one who has left home in the Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is contrary to the Dharma; if such a one is without discrimination, this is in accord with the Dharma.\n“Look at the bodhisattvas, to whom the ﬂowers do not adhere—this is because they have eradicated all discriminative thoughts.\n“For example, when a person is afraid, non-human [beings] are able to control him. Thus, since the disciples fear samsara, then forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles control you. None of the ﬁve desires can affect those who have transcended fear.\n“It is only because the latent inﬂuences [of your afﬂictions] are not yet exhausted that the ﬂowers stick to your bodies. “For those in whom the latent inﬂuences are exhausted, the ﬂowers do not stick.”\nŚāriputra said, “Have you stayed in this room long?”  Answer: “I have stayed in this room as long as you have been emancipated.”\nŚāriputra said, “How long have you stayed here?”\nThe goddess said, “How long has it been since your emancipation?”\nŚāriputra was silent and did not answer.\nThe goddess said, “What is your great wisdom that you remain silent?”\nAnswer: “Emancipation is not to be spoken of, and so I did not know what to say.”\nThe goddess said, “Speech and words are entirely the characteristics of emancipation. Why?\n“Emancipation is neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Words are also neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Therefore, Śāriputra, the explanation of emancipation does not transcend words. Why?\n“All dharmas have the characteristic of emancipation.”\nŚāriputra said, “Is it not also that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity?”\nThe goddess said, “On behalf of the self-conceited, the Buddha explained that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity. If one is not self-conceited, the Buddha explains that licentiousness, anger, and stupidity are emancipation.”\nTeisho If you are awakened you can speak freely in order to bring this awakening to everyone. But this is what Sariputra is still caught on. We have to see what the Buddha has helped us to realize: that it is important for us not to stagnate in an initial understanding; instead we must continue in our state of awareness and deepen it. We don’t stop with knowing that we should not be caught on greed, anger, and delusion, but we live in such a way that we are not caught on them while seeing that within them there is also a way to further liberation. Don’t think about how you are awakened and become proud of that, but live from that awakened state in a way that others can learn from it. Vimalakirti is telling us that if you are still moved around by greed, anger and ignorance, or if you are still moved around by time, by space, and by acquiring, that is not true liberation.\nReferences [24][chapter 7]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

The examples are numberless, but what he is saying is this: the mind of this one moment has no clutter in it; do not become that state of mind where clutter gathers.\nVimalakirti is telling us not to be caught on our conditioned ways of behaving, not to see our behavior in the usual context, and not to follow precepts in the usual way, but when we see those who are suffering in pain, experience that in an empathetic way.

Ignorance and affection constitute this seed. Lust, anger, and stupidity constitute this seed. The four confusions constitute this seed. The ﬁve hindrances constitute this seed. The six entrances (āyatanas) constitute this seed. The seven loci of consciousness constitute this seed. The eight heterodox dharmas and nine loci of afﬂiction constitute this seed. The ten evil actions constitute this seed. In essence, the sixty-two mistaken views and all the afﬂictions constitute this seed.”\n  [Vimalakīrti] said, “Why is this?”\n[Mañjuśrī] answered, “Anyone who sees the unconditioned and enters the primary status [of Hinayana enlightenment] will be unable to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyak saṃbodhi.\n“It is just as lotus ﬂowers do not grow on dry land on the high plateau— these ﬂowers grow in the muddy ﬁlth of the lowly marshes. Thus one who sees the unconditioned dharmas and enters the primary status will never be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha. It is only within the mud of the afﬂictions that sentient beings give rise to the dharmas of a buddha.\n“Or again, it is like planting a seed in space, where it would never grow— only in nightsoil-enriched earth can it ﬂourish. In this way, one who enters the unconditioned primary status will not be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha.\n“It is only when one generates a view of self as great as Mount Sumeru that one is able to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi and generate the dharmas of a buddha.\n“Therefore, you should understand that all the afﬂictions constitute the seed of the Tathāgata. It is like not being able to attain the priceless jewelpearl without entering the ocean. Therefore, if one does not enter the great sea of the afﬂictions, one will not be able to attain the jewel of omniscience.”\n  Teisho If we are born with all of our limbs but do not know gratitude for them, then there is nothing more debilitating than that. This is the same as being endowed with a splendid mind but never awakening to that Mind. Vimalakirti says this awakening cannot be done by trying to look good in some prescribed way. He is not saying to avoid doing good things, but to not try to look good as you do things, to not put on a show of doing such good things and performing important good deeds. Do not be deceived by the behavior of those who are thinking of themselves and trying to appear as good people. That is full of ego! Rather, offer everything by throwing yourself into society. This is how true liberation takes place.\nIn this way Vimalakirti says that we cannot simply walk a conceptual path following in the footsteps of everyone else. We have to let go of everything to liberate all beings, or there will be no liberation. When our mind is not moved around at all, for the first time we can become one with the Buddha’s way.\nReferences [26][Chapter 8]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

At sixteen months, we for the fi rst time know that there is a me. And then at twenty-four months we know that this is divisible into two, a me and an other. And at thirty-six months we become dualistic in perceiving things. Initially, everything is perceived, and then we begin to judge and to evaluate. We don’t want to not benefi t in any situation. While our original mind is like this, it is also like a great round mirror mind, not narrow and limited. We are a moving life energy. We exist because of what that is. And that is what we are.

This is to enter the Dharma gate of non duality.” Mañjuśrī then asked Vimalakīrti, “We have each made our own explanations. Sir, you should explain how the bodhisattva enters the Dharma gate of nonduality.”\nAt this point Vimalakīrti was silent, saying nothing.\nMañjuśrī exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent! Not to even have words or speech is the true entrance into the Dharma gate of nonduality.”  Teisho Here there is no use for syllables, sounds and ideas. Vimalakirti gave not one sound. And without adding a word or even half a word, he responds without responding. He said nothing at all.\nThirty-one bodhisattvas had told their experiences of it, and for us as well, telling experiences is not the Buddha Dharma and is not Zen. Each bodhisattva had told an experience, and there was no mistake in that experience itself. But in the very telling of it we separate from the experience itself. Manjusri also said that. But even saying that is extra.

The bodhisattvas each sit beneath fragrant trees, smelling such wondrous fragrances, from which they attain the ‘samādhi of the repository of all virtues.’ Those who attain this samādhi all become replete in the merits of the bodhisattva.”  Teisho The Buddha there doesn’t teach with words.

It is neither to transcend great sympathy nor to forsake great compassion, to profoundly generate the aspiration to achieve omniscience and never forget it even momentarily. It is to teach sentient beings without ever becoming tired, to be constantly mindful of following the teaching of the four attractions. It is to defend the correct Dharma without fear for one’s own life, to plant good roots without becoming fatigued. It is for one’s intent to always be on peaceful abiding and one’s skillful means rededicated [to anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi]. It is to seek the Dharma without tiring and explain the Dharma without parsimony, and to energetically make offerings to the buddhas.\n  Teisho Each and every one of us is a form that will die and change. And each person has ego. In this ego and this body have greed and anger and ignorance. And when we go all of it will be gone as well. Holding on to any of it has no purpose. Bodhisattvas who care for this world, do not take any aspects personally. In general, people in society, work for their own satisfaction whereas bodhisattvas make use of everything for the awakening of all beings. At every step, we must throw everything away, seeing that the compounded is not different from the uncompounded. By deeply caring for all beings, we will not be toppled over by our ideals and can transform even our complaining into wisdom.\nAnd how do we liberate this world of the compounded when we are full of difficulties and differences, knowing that the world is full of delusion and phenomena? If we try to do this mentally, it won’t work, but when we raise the vow to achieve liberation by caring deeply for every being’s deep mind will this world be seen clearly and given liberation.

In this way, in the Dhammapada, the Buddha teaches, “How rare it is in this world of life and death to be alive. How rare it is to be able in this world to hear the Dharma. How rare it is in this world to be able to practice the truth of this Dharma. And how rare it is in this world to be able to meet a true teacher.”\nOur life is very full of ups and downs. We succeed.

He has no accumulation of the six sensory capacities, and his eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind have already passed beyond and are not within the triple world.\n“Having transcended the three deﬁlements, he is in accord with the three emancipations. Complete in the three illuminations, he is equivalent to ignorance.\n“He is neither the single characteristic nor different characteristics. He is neither a self-characteristic nor an other-characteristic. He is neither without characteristics, nor does he grasp characteristics.\n“He is not of this shore, nor of the other shore, nor of the current [of samsara] in between, yet he converts sentient beings. I view him in extinction, yet he is not permanently in extinction. He is neither this nor that, and he neither uses this nor uses that.\n“He cannot be understood with wisdom, nor can he be known by consciousness. He is without darkness (i.e., ignorance), without brightness (i.e., understanding), without name, and without characteristic. He is without strength, without weakness, and neither pure nor deﬁled. He does not occupy a region, nor does he transcend the regions.\n“He is neither conditioned nor unconditioned. He is without manifesting and without explaining.\n“He is neither charitable nor stingy, neither observant nor transgressive [of the precepts], neither forbearant nor angry, neither energetic nor lazy, neither composed nor perturbed, and neither wise nor foolish. He is neither sincere nor dissembling, neither coming nor going, neither exiting nor entering. All the paths of words are eliminated.\n“He is neither a ﬁeld of blessings nor not a ﬁeld of blessings. He is neither one worthy of offerings (i.e., arhat) nor not one worthy of offerings.\n“He neither grasps nor forsakes; he neither has characteristics nor is without characteristics.\n“He is identical to the true limit and equivalent to the Dharma-nature.\n“He is indescribable, incalculable; he transcends appellations and measures. He is neither great nor small.\n“He is neither vision, nor hearing, nor perceiving, nor knowing; he transcends the host of fetters. He is equivalent to the various types of wisdom and identical to sentient beings. He is without discrimination with regard to the dharmas.\n“He is entirely without failing, without impurity, without vexation, without intentionality (lit., “unconstructed”), without activation, without generation, and without extinction; without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without dislike, and without attachment; without past, without future, and without present.

To use this contemplation is called the correct contemplation. If [one uses some] other contemplation, this is called the incorrect contemplation.”\nTeisho The bodhisattvas that accompanied Vimalakirti wanted to know what makes a Buddha. Gautama Siddhartha awakened to the truth under the Bodhi tree. For 21 days he deepened his awakening and then he considered how to share the truth of what he had realized. So he went to Sarnath where his friends with whom he had trained in austerities were staying. He taught, guided and awakened all of them.\nAt that time there was only the dharma and this small sangha, nothing called Buddha yet. Buddha means this historic person, and it also means something different that goes beyond history. The Dharma is the Buddha, not just a person at some point in history, but the Dharma is the Buddha. When Ananda asked when the Buddha was about to die, now what were they to do? The Buddha said, “Do not seek refuge externally. Seek refuge within. Do not seek refuge in external things. Take refuge only in the Dharma”. When the dharma is clear to us, everything is clear and right, to see the dharma allows us to resolve everything and to see how to be.\nReferences [36][chapter 12]\nBibliography Taigan Sodo Roshi (Sodo Harada Roshi), Teisho on the Vimalakirti Sutra (volume 1), 2014,\nMcRae, John (2004).

Although bodhisattvas die, they do not exhaust their roots of goodness, and although they are born they do not nurture the various evils.”\nTeisho All of the disciples of the Buddha, the great disciples, all of their wisdom together would have been only one sixteenth of the wisdom, of the great wisdom of Sariputra. And yet in this sutra he is often turned into the bad guy. Here, he is asking slightly flatteringly, in what world had Vimalakirti lived before, what great world, because his wisdom was so great and it continues.\nWhen we see a movie we are only seeing it as real while we watch it. When it is over we don’t think the things in the movie are continuing going on and are real and actual somewhere. And this is the same with everything in our environment and with our bodies as well. But instead of seeing this clearly as it really is, we put down that person, we get bothered by this person, we can’t stand having to see this person. Yet while we know all of it is phenomena we also still have to hold each person and meeting precious and know that it is a rare occasion.\nOn knowing that, this is all phenomena at the same thing, at the same time, not thinking that each and everything is worthless because it’s phenomena. Not holding on to attached feelings about this phenomena either. But that would be the same as being attached to things in a movie.

We can't look at this only conceptually. If all 6.3 billion people actually had equal amounts to eat, they could be peaceful and harmonious. It is our responsibility to see that that happens. Yet just saying peace, peace, peace and trying to help by holding meetings is not sufficient. Harmony also requires respect for each person's deepest character. Then we are like friends, intimate not just in form but with each other's deep character. This is the level on which we must be intimate. Regardless of our class or caste or culture or language, we're all humans, and we have to respect each other's deepest character, or it won't work.\nWe have to feel this respect not just because we are told to but because we have a clear mind to respect with. Otherwise it is only a ritual. If our mind is not truly balanced, we can't respect others in a balanced way. That clear mind also has to receive what all people have to say, in all kinds of situations, or the things we encounter will confuse and twist us and make us unstable and insecure. No matter what comes to us from the outside, we must have an essence that is not moved around by anything. If we are not as peaceful as the bottom of the ocean, it is not true peace. That is why we need \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nThese words and ideas have been used for many centuries, teaching that in our human relationships, we find peace by respecting each other's deepest character. In the Lotus Sutra there is the story of Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva, who did not recite sutras or sit zazen but prostrated to everyone he encountered, saying he had deep respect for them and they would become a Buddha. He prayed to each person, but those who were prayed to didn't think they were so worthy of respect. Because they disliked themselves, they would get angry and spit at him and hit him and yell at him. But he would simply reply, \u0026ldquo;I have a deep respect for you; I see in you the deep Mind of Buddha.\u0026rdquo; This Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva was one of the Buddha's past lives.\nIt is said that any religion that isn't like this won't last. Religion can't be just a matter of praying to a God. We must find and awaken to our deep godlike potential. This must be realized deeply and then polished and respected in each other.\nTea House The empty room of Vimalakirti where Manjusri comes to inquire of Vimalakirti's illness is said to be the source of the tea house, tea ceremony and the tea garden. This way of tea ceremony, with its spare hermitage-like tea room and simple garden was begun by Tea Master Rikyu. He did long years of practice and zazen and from his deep power of vow he taught that the first priority in the training of tea is to intimately study the Dharma. He taught this himself and he was always creating a context of how it is in the zendo, and also that the tea garden should maintain the simplicity of a Zen temple garden.\nThis is Rikyu’s own way of teaching, and it was this very hut of Vimalakirti which was the model for Rikyu’s teahouse. When Vimalakirti took everything out of his house, leaving only one bed where he lay, this way of being is a way of expressing one’s own life. The tearoom is usually the size of four and one half tatami mats and outside of the tea room there is a small simple garden. The four and one half mat room is the size taken from the Vimalakirti Sutra; the small simple garden comes from the teaching in the Lotus sutra. The room in which Vimalakirti lived was a square, four and one half tatami sized room, and this is the same as the word for a head priest of a temple. It is a little larger than nine feet square, with the addition of the tokonoma and a wooden board; this is just the size of four and one half tatami mats.\nOne Buddha land. Buddha lands are not about space, but about being one complete world, three meters square. In the case of the tea room, we purify our senses before entering it, rinse our mouths, and put away our worldly thoughts and ideas. We enter the room with a quiet focused minds. Usually, about three or four people can fit into a tea room comfortably. But if there are no mental, dualistic ideas to restrict and make it narrow, it is not difficult for a three meter square tea room to hold eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, and one hundred thousand gods and goddesses. We can all enter if we think about it. Rationally it may seem impossible. But since it is the whole great space in that room, it is an infinite size.\nAt the doorway to the tea ceremony room a fan is placed on the tatami, marking a definite entrance. Then we go to the tokonoma, the place where even in a regular house we find a space for our mind to become settled. Our house is a place to rest our tired body, but it also has to be a place to find peace and a settled mind. The One Drop Zendos’ are also places where we can respect each other and find peace. The tokonoma was originally a Buddha altar, and that is why incense is offered to the Buddha's words that hang there, and light is provided to light those words and our travel. To the right is a candle, to the left is water, and in the middle is an incense burner.\nHung in the middle of the tokonoma are the Buddha's or Patriarchs\u0026rsquo; phrases. They always hang there, providing a place of refuge for our mind. The words are a resting place, a staff for our mind, so we can sit down silently. In the tea room the tokonoma is for bowing to and honoring, not as a matter of form but from the true depths of our mind. If we always do that with respect for all people who share this same deep mind, we will all be awakened to that.\nThen we look at each tea utensil very seriously, examining it and seeing the value in each one. The beauty and the flavor of each has to be looked at carefully to see its highest quality. We can't just look vaguely, there is no exchange of mind in that. A scholar of justice once said to his students, \u0026ldquo;Do you know that justice and law are the most feared subjects? But they are only about respecting society and the people in it, not about studying punishment. You have to see all things clearly before you start this study. Go and see things that were used as tools before the time of Christ, look at things in the museums and how they were used. You have to learn how to see things deeply. If you can't pray for the best for society, you can't understand justice. We have to study all things and see them well to know what will be useful and best for each person.\u0026rdquo;\nWe look carefully at each individual tea bowl. We touch the life energy of one flower in a vase. We smell the incense and feel the warmth of the water, and there our very mind's depth is warmed as well. Not as things but as real live people we greet these utensils, and our deep respect grows and is cultivated.\nAs we give our mind to each and every thing, we know the source of peace and harmony. It is not only about respecting people and character, but so often we can't even do that. We are always judging the ways of others or their past deeds or their bad habits. We are always looking at their weaknesses. But if we do that we can't truthfully respect them. As Jo Fukyo Bodhisattva did, we have to let go of all ideas of good and bad before we can truly respect someone, and we can't enter the tea room sincerely unless we are peaceful in our own mind. We must have a mind like a mirror that simply reflects and does not judge. Then we can see in the same way as God, who gives rain equally to good people and bad, and realize that we have that very same mind inside us.\nVimalakirti is the one who gave birth to the tea room garden, a small garden outside the tea room that is like the one written about in the Vimalakirti Sutra. Vimalakirti's room is called a hojo. It is the size of four and one half tatami mats, just big enough for a human to live in the least possible space. Vimalakirti was sick in such a room when Manjusri came to visit with many Bodhisattvas, but there was nothing at all in the room. Vimalakirti was just burning incense and waiting. In the tea ceremony as well, nothing extra is added. There is only the fragrance of incense and flowers; everything else is empty. Thus is the empty mind of the tea master expressed. The guests purify themselves by washing their hands at the rock basin and then enter with a purified mind.\nJapanese used to go to nature in the mountains repeating, \u0026ldquo;Six Senses Purified, Six Senses Purified.\u0026rdquo; All of the senses and the whole body become pure when we climb a mountain. We see the mountain, and our eyes are purified. Hearing the birds, our ears are purified. We drink the clear river's water, and our mouth is purified. We sweat, and our body is purified. We climb the mountain and think nothing at all, and our mind is purified. In this way, we make all of our senses pure. This is the purity of \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is where the ideas and doctrines of all religions return to the pure source of true religion. For all religions this idea of purity is important, or it is not true religion.\nYet we also have so much past experience and knowledge. As Bankei Zenji has said it, \u0026ldquo;That old barrel\u0026ndash;if we burst the bottom out we have three barrel staves and one empty circle or enso.\u0026rdquo; We are so full of emotions and past experiences and ideas that are so interesting, or so frustrating. Those ideas are fine when they arise, but if we keep piling them up our mind becomes like a tank filled with methane gas. We must not let that make us dark and heavy. That ego sludge at the barrel's bottom has to be burst through. All the sides then fall away, and there is only that circle of the bottom of the barrel. One circle, our true pure clear mind, the mind of God, humans\u0026rsquo; original mind, which is empty like a mirror, pure and clear.\nWe have added things to that original mind and lost sight of its clarity. If religion is necessary at all, it is to let go of what we have become stuck on and awaken to our original mind. For doing just this we have zazen. When we let go of everything we have accumulated, we can see directly what is actually there. Then we can use our experiences and knowledge without mistake, for all beings and for all of society. For this we have to purify that mind, this clear \u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the Buddha said, we have to extinguish the flames of greed, extinguish the flames of ignorance, and extinguish the flames of anger, and then we will know nirvana's tranquillity. If we realize the true source of our mind, we know this pure and clear place, and from there we respect all beings. This is the source of peace for the whole world.\n\u0026ldquo;Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity.\u0026rdquo;\nNot just for tea ceremony, but as the source of peace for all humankind.\n\u0026ldquo;Vimalakirti meets Manjusri in his \u0026lsquo;tea room\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;\n ","id":47,"length":2241,"title":"Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity","type":"entry","url":"//localhost:1313/catalogue/44/"},{"content":"","id":48,"length":"","title":"The VImalakirti Sutra","type":"","url":""},{"content":" Taigan Shodo Harada Roshi       Taigan Shodo Roshi (born 1940) is a Zen teacher, successor of Yamada Mumon Roshi, received his Dharma transmission in 1982 and became the head abbot of Sogenji Monastery in Okayama, where he has been teaching mainly foreign students since then.

The Mahayana vehicle is for all to get on a ride together: to create this great faith that we are endowed with this wisdom from the origin and that we work from it. We work from it by expressing it as that vow to put our life on the line for the realization of all beings. This was the strength of the Mahayana, which is to polish this wisdom deeply, and with that which we can know and see from that polished wisdom, to then bring that wisdom to all people. This is the way that it came to be and will continue into the future. And those who are of sincere and true devotion to wanting to keep this teaching going, proceed in this way to completely polish and fulfill the wisdom that is within us, and always keep our deepest vow of bringing an end to the suffering for all beings.\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that this can be done by people who are working in society, having regular lives with families. It is for this reason that the Mahayana tradition has the approach that it can be done by everyone, not just by a few ordained people. All of us we are endowed with and hold this wisdom. The point is for it to be realized and then to live in accordance with it. First of all we have to clarify this wisdom, and then we learn how to live that truth in our daily lives, learn to work and create things without, for example, damaging the environment.\nThe source of all the problems is that we get caught on our ego-filter. Ego and ego-perspective—this is what undermines our efforts and makes things difficult. To be able to see what it is, to be in a world without being moved around by and ruled by this ego—that is what we must do.\nThis wisdom which is being taught here is the wisdom which appears to be two but which is not two separate things. As Dogen Zenji has written it poetically, “Foolish me! I’ll never become closer to the Buddha, just going further and further away.” We have to offer everything to society, and without being concerned about our own work, to instead bring what we realize through our wisdom to all beings. Jumping into that aspect of it, we purify everything. This is the teaching—the truth—of the Mahayana.\nAt the base of these many slogans is the deep wisdom of the Mahayana, as expressed here by the teachings of Vimalakirti. Vimalakirti, who was living in society in the midst of everyone living the life of society, was never caught by the things people are usually caught by—livelihood and family life. He was not clinging. He was always correcting others for being moved around, especially chiding the Buddha’s disciples, not just by criticizing and trying to improve them, but also in ways that would teach them to have a broader state of mind: that work of realizing the True-nature in every single thing we do. This was the functioning of the pure wisdom of Vimalakirti, who aptly had two other names, “Purest Name Bodhisattva,” and “No Defilement Bodhisattva.”\nThere are two other names for the Vimalakirti Sutra as well. One is “The Inconceivable Liberation Sutra” and the other is “The Rebirth Liberation Sutra”. These two names show how this sutra, in particular, goes beyond all of the paradoxes which it brings up, resolving them by becoming much more huge, expansive and embracing of the questions of the paradox and, in this way, making the truth come clear.\nPeople in society usually put a great value on having money, but here Vimalakirti is placing that side by side with the value of living the truth, saying: look at the differences, look at the value of each. We can come to see how this is possible when we read the words in the section called “Liberation” —the Liberation section of this whole sutra which is also called the Liberation Sutra.\nSome people want to drink sake, or they want to follow their own interests and impulses so they can get anything they want. Rather than getting caught like that on the views of a small ego and in that way separating from other beings, how much better to live in a way where we are using our life as a place of practice in every thing we do. Not caught on anything at all, we let go of our deepest attachments and see the place that is untouched by that clinging!\nIn society we need to bring to the fore our ability to offer ourselves for other people rather than trying to get what we personally prefer. To do that we have to know how to ‘kill’ our selfishness completely. But we are always getting caught by thinking of ourselves as a small self which is limited by ego and an ego view. Because we can’t let go of that, we get caught and choked by some narrow vision of who we mistakenly think we are. To let go of that we have to do zazen and learn to not be moved around by always thinking about how others are regarding us. And we do zazen to learn to discard the small self version of what we think we are and what we think we want most—let go of that for a bigger picture which is more true.\nWe do zazen so that we are not caught by and stuck on this limited egoistic version of ourself as a human body and to see that we are not small-minded. We have to do zazen so that we are also not limiting other people. and to see that. We imagine a version of our human life as the person who is alive between a certain birth and a certain death; we imagine this is who we are. Through zazen we come to see that while this is one part of it, there is a much greater part as well; we are not limited by something called being born and dying.\n    We have to ‘kill’ our small, egoistic self completely in order to let go of that stuck, ego view. All of the ancients passed through this, and we, too, have to free uourselves from our egoistic view and awaken to what is best for everyone! For doing this we have to die and be reborn in a completely true way. If we can die totally in this way, then we can see the place of rebirth. We have to push ourselves into it, to dig in and actually die completely in order to be able to understand and realize that name of this text which is called “The Inconceivable Rebirth.”\nBuddhism is not for making me stronger, for making one’s own self-centered, egoistic view more central. It is to become the person who is not moved around by anything that anyone says to us. It is only in not becoming that person that we are insufficient. To see what we can do when people are criticizing us or putting us down—to what degree can we not be moved around by that whatsoever—to see this place beyond our egoistic perception where we’re not caught on ourselves as what is being talked to and what is being put down, to step away from that and know that that is not the whole picture—it is for this that we do our practice.\nTo live in a world where there are the phenomena of birth and death without being caught on those phenomena whatsoever, to always be smiling in spite of that, to not be clinging to that piece of the whole picture. To know failure, to know success, to know winning, to know losing without being caught on any of them—this is truly Inconceivable Liberation. As long as we are alive, we have desires; we have things that are affecting our body. While experiencing all of that, to not be upset or caught on any of it in an egoistic way—this is truly the Inconceivable Liberation.\nVimalakirti’s sutra today would perhaps be called something like an opera or a drama with all kinds of props, all kinds of scenes, all kinds of characters. We have the Buddha coming in, bodhisattvas, devils, heavenly angels, all coming and going in order to suddenly awaken us. It may seem like an opera right in front of us, but in this way we can see the truth and suddenly become awakened in a new way.\nThis opening section is about letting go of the small self. So how do we do that? This is what Zen is teaching us; it is that teaching that makes us know how important it is to let go and let go and let go of it right now. All people have this ego-attachment. It’s very strong, even in children and in old people. It is most deeply set there, in their wanting to have what they want the most. But we know that we have to get old. To let go of that ego view right now, while we are still young!\n","id":50,"length":1563,"title":"On the Purpose of this Sutra","type":"splash","url":"//localhost:1313/sutra/intro/"},{"content":"The primary translation used for the Vimalakirti Sutra is from John McRae.\nSome calligraphy were taken from the 6 volume \u0026ldquo;Staff for Mind (Kokuro No Tsui)\u0026quot;, privately published between 2000 and 2006.\n McRae McRae, John (2004).

He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means.\n“Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”\nTeisho Even though the Buddha had requested it of them, none the disciples felt that they were able to call on Vimalakirti, having been reprimanded and cautioned by him in previous encounters. They had all been exhorted by VImalakirti to improve their training and felt they were not good enough to meet him again. So now the Buddha asks Manjusri Bodhisattva to go.\nBecause it was a momentous event, a large entourage of eight thousand disciples, five hundred bodhisattvas, and a hundred thousand gods and goddesses all came with Manjusri to see Vimalakirti.\nSutra  At that time the Elder Vimalakirti thought, “Now Mañjusri and a great congregation is coming.”\nThen with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.\n  Mañjusri entered the house, and he saw the room was empty, with Vimalakirti lying alone on a single couch.\n  Teisho Manjusri went with many disciples and heavenly beings to visit Vimalakirti. In his house, in his small room, there was not one single thing, only Vimalakirti resting alone. There was incense burning and he was waiting for the guests. This is the \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; tearoom. No matter what wonderful tea utensils there are, they are put away and only a single flower is offered to the Buddha. Incense is also offered and nothing else is in the room. This is the rule for the host, to create a room where no random thoughts can enter. It is the clear mind of the host that prepares this room.\n\u0026ldquo;The Tea room within - Harmony, respect, purity, tranquillity\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce we enter the tearoom there are only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers to be seen, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose and we taste the delicious tea. With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, clarity and serenity are realized. The room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure and so was his heart and his mind, with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri Bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.\n ","id":53,"length":540,"title":"Mañjusri Visits Vimalakirti: Condolences","type":"essay","url":"//localhost:1313/sutra/chptr5/"}]
