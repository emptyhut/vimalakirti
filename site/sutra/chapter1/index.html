<h3 id="poem-opening-teisho-on-september-2007">Poem opening teisho on September 2007</h3>
<p class="poem">
The three thousand realms—all within a mote of dust;<br>
In an instant of time the Dharma wheel revolves!<br>
When the skin is shed, “inner” and “outer” are no more;<br>
Self-nature is truly the essence of the Real.</p>
<p class="P3">Day One</p>
<h4 id="teisho">Teisho</h4>
<p class="teisho">From today, we will be reading together the Sutra of Vimalakirti. </p>
<p class="teisho">Kinsoku Buddha, for the sake of all beings, borrowed the form of a bodhisattva. To do this, he borrowed the form of a lay person, Vimalakirti. Kinsoku Buddha appeared as a lay person who had a presence in society, who was working in society, and who had a family life. This was a person who would show that all people are able—regardless of their way of life, whether they are ordained or not ordained—to realize True nature. And so we have the layman Vimalakirti.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Sutra of Vimalakirti is one of the sutras of the Buddha, along with the Lotus Sutra and the Shomon-gyo [Brahma Excellent Thought Sutra]. These sutras come from the years after the Buddha had awakened, when he took what he had realized and went everywhere, teaching and guiding, until he entered Nirvana in the grove of sala trees. This all took place 2500 years ago. </p>
<p class="teisho">The central teaching of the Mahayana or Greater Vehicle is for everyone to polish their wisdom, and while polishing one’s own wisdom to also guide others with the wisdom that is manifested. The Mahayana vehicle is for all beings to get on and ride together:  to create this great faith that we are endowed with wisdom from the origin and that we work from it by expressing it as the vow to put our life on the line for the realization of all beings. The strength of the Mahayana, is to polish this wisdom deeply, and with that which we know and see with that polished wisdom, to then bring that wisdom to all people. This is the way that it came to be and will continue into the future. And those who are sincere and truly devoted to keeping this teaching going, proceed in this way. Completely polish and fulfill the wisdom that is within us, and always keep our deepest vow of bringing an end to the suffering for all beings.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Lotus Sutra teaches that this can be done by people who are working in society, having regular lives with families. It is for this reason that the Mahayana tradition has the approach that it can be done by everyone, not just by a few ordained people. All of us are endowed with and hold this wisdom. The point is for it to be realized and then to live in accordance with it. First of all we have to clarify this wisdom, and then we learn how to live that truth in our daily lives, learn to work and create things without, for example, damaging the environment.</p>
<p class="teisho">The source of all our problems is that we get caught on our ego-filter. Ego and ego-perspective—this is what undermines our efforts and makes things difficult. To be able to see what it is, to be in a world without being moved around by and ruled by this ego—that is what we must do.</p>
<p class="teisho">This wisdom which is being taught here is the wisdom which appears to be two but which is not two separate things. As Dogen Zenji has poetically written, “Foolish me! I’ll never become closer to the Buddha, just going further and further away.” We have to offer everything to society, and without being concerned about our own work, we bring what we realize through our wisdom to all beings. Jumping into that aspect of it, we purify everything. This is the teaching—the truth—of the Mahayana.</p>
<p class="teisho">At the base of these many slogans is the deep wisdom of the Mahayana, as expressed here by the teachings of Vimalakirti. Vimalakirti, who was living in society in the midst of everyone living the life of society, was never caught by the things people are usually caught by—livelihood and family life. He was not clinging onto anything. He was always correcting others for being moved around, especially chiding the Buddha’s disciples, not just by criticizing and trying to improve them, but also in ways that would teach them to have a broader state of mind: that work of realizing the True nature in every single thing we do. This was the functioning of the pure wisdom of Vimalakirti, who aptly had two other names, “Purest Name Bodhisattva,” and “No Defilement Bodhisattva.”</p>
<p class="teisho">The Vimalakirti Sutra has two other names, one is “The Inconceivable Liberation Sutra” and the other is “The Rebirth Liberation Sutra”. These two names show how this sutra, in particular, goes beyond all of the paradoxes which it brings up, resolving them by becoming much more huge, expansive and embracing of the questions of the paradox and, in this way, making the truth clear.</p>
<p class="teisho">People in society usually put great value on having money, but here Vimalakirti is placing that side by side with the value of living the truth, saying: look at the differences, look at the value of each. We can come to see how this is possible when we read the the next chapter called “Liberation Techniques” or “Skillful Means”.</p>
<p class="teisho">Some people want to drink sake, or they want to follow their own interests and impulses so they can get anything they want. Rather than getting caught like that on the views of a small ego and in that way separating from other beings, how much better to live in a way where we are using our life as a place of practice in every thing we do. Not caught on anything at all, we let go of our deepest attachments and see the place within that is untouched by that clinging!</p>
<p class="teisho">In society we need to bring to the fore our ability to offer ourselves for other people rather than trying to get what we personally prefer. To do that we have to know how to ‘kill’ our selfishness completely. But we are always getting caught by thinking of ourselves as a small self which is limited by ego and an ego view. Because we can’t let go of that we get caught and choked by some narrow vision of who we mistakenly think we are. To let go of that we have to do zazen and not be moved around by always thinking about how others are regarding us. We have to do zazen to learn to put down what we want most, what we think we are—let go of that for a bigger picture which is more true. </p>
<p class="teisho">We do zazen so that we are not caught by and stuck on a limited egoistic version of ourselves as a human body, and to see that we are not small-minded. Also, we have to do zazen so that we are not limiting other people. </p>
<p class="teisho">We imagine a version of our human life as the person who is alive between a certain birth and a certain death; we imagine this is who we are. Through zazen we come to see that while this is one part of it, there is a much greater part as well; we are not limited by something called being born and dying.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have to ‘kill’ our small, egoistic self completely in order to let go of that stuck, ego view. All of the ancients passed through this, and we, too, have to free ourselves from our egoistic view and awaken to what is best for everyone! For doing this we have to die and be reborn in a completely true way. If we can die totally in this way, then we can see the place of rebirth. We have to push ourselves into it, to dig in and actually die completely in order to be able to understand and realize that name of this text which is called “The Inconceivable Rebirth.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Buddhism is not for making one stronger, for making one’s own self-centered, egoistic view more central. It is to become the person who is not moved around by anything that anyone says to us. It is only in not becoming that person that we are insufficient. To see what we can do when people are criticizing us or putting us down—to what degree can we not be moved around by that whatsoever—to see this place beyond our egoistic perception where we’re not caught on ourselves as what is being talked to and what is being put down, to even step away from that and know that that is not the whole picture—it is for this that we do our practice.</p>
<p class="teisho">To live in a world where there are the phenomena of birth and death without being caught on those phenomena, to always be smiling in spite of that, to not be clinging to that piece of the whole picture, to know failure, to know success, to know winning, to know losing without being caught on any of them—this is truly Inconceivable Liberation. As long as we are alive we have desires; we have things that are affecting our body.  While experiencing all of that, to not be upset or caught on any of it in an egoistic way—this is truly the Inconceivable Liberation.</p>
<p class="teisho">Vimalakirti’s sutra today would perhaps be called something like an opera or a drama with all kinds of props, all kinds of scenes, and all kinds of characters. We have the Buddha coming in, bodhisattvas, devils, heavenly angels, all coming and going in order to suddenly awaken us. It may seem like an opera right in front of us, but it is in this way we can see the truth and suddenly become awakened in a new way.</p>
<p class="teisho">This opening section is about letting go of the small self. So how do we do that? This is what Zen is teaching us; it is that teaching that makes us know how important it is to let go and let go and let go of it right now. All people have this ego-attachment. It’s very strong, even in children and in old people. It is most deeply set there, in their wanting to have what they want the most. But we know that we have to get old. To let go of that ego view right now, while we are still young! That shows us how important it is to give everything we can to doing this sesshin.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Two</p>
<p class="teisho">The first section of the Vimalakirti Sutra is “The Purification of Buddha Lands.” The version that we are working from is the translation from Yoshin Sanzo Kumuraju [Kumarajiva]. First given in India, the original text is not known, but while there were seven varieties of translations in existence, this is the one which we will be using and which is considered to be the most excellent.</p>
<p class="teisho">A Buddha land—this is a place where all people awaken, and from that awakened state of mind a land comes forth. It is not about people dissatisfied with material things and carrying their personal standards and values around—the things that they want—but about realizing the laws of our state of mind and awakening to what is within in the deepest way, seeing that which is splendid in each and every human being. People who are coming from this place—what kind of a country would this become?</p>
<h4 id="sutra">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the garden of Āmrapālī near Vaiśālī, in the company of a great congregation of eight thousand bhikṣus. </p>
<p class="sutra">There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, recognized by the congregation.</p>
<p class="teisho">“Thus have I heard at one time” is the way true sutras begin. At the time of the Second Great Assembly, five hundred years after the Buddha died, the Assembly—following the original assembly at the Cave of Parakutsu where Ananda spoke and corrected and added to the remembering of the sutras by the five hundred arhats—at this time these sutras which were declared to be correct were all beginning with “Thus have I heard at one time.” The arhats had brought the sutras, and then Ananda, who had memorized them all in his twenty-five years with the Buddha, told what the Buddha had said. So it was a combination of efforts from both Ananda and the arhats that made these sutras as clear as possible. <span class="Italic">Āmrapālī</span> was a mango grove given to the Buddha by a wealthy family. The man had died, and his wife became a nun following his death. This was very unusual at that time. They gave the land to the Buddha and built a temple there. This becomes the stage for the play of the Sutra of Vimalakirti. There are 8,000 <span class="Italic">bhikṣus</span> there, all saints, and 32,000 bodhisattvas.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-1">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">Of bhikṣus there were eight thousand, all saints. They were free from impurities and afflictions, and all had attained self-mastery. Their minds were entirely liberated by perfect knowledge.</p>
<p class="teisho">Everyone who had gathered were awakened to deepest wisdom, and awakened without mistake. Most important is that wisdom that comes forth in the Four Vows, the vows which we read every day, the truth of the Way of the Bodhisattva. </p>
<h4 id="sutra-2">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">Sentient beings are numberless: I vow to liberate them.  Desires are inexhaustible: I vow to put an end to them. The Dharmas are boundless: I vow to master them. The Buddha’s way is unsurpassable: I vow to become it.</p>
<p class="teisho">To seek this truth for all people, never stopping, to work always from our deepest understanding, to know what needs most to be done, is what is important. But first we have to awaken to that wisdom within. We gather information in our life, which brings us what we call knowledge. We use that knowledge with our spacious, expansive mind to be able to understand what is true. And that combination brings deep wisdom. To be able to know all beings’ truest source—from here also comes wisdom. If it is only knowledge it can only turn into a narrow, rigid, dualistic view. Instead, to realize that wisdom is the most important and quickest way to bring realization to all beings. It was people who were aware and wise in this way that had gathered here at <span class="Italic">Āmrapālī</span>.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this sesshin as well, we are here to awaken to our wisdom—that source of the Buddha’s wisdom—one and the same source in all of us.</p>
<p class="teisho">That mind which is also like poisonous snakes, gangs of thieves, or wild animals in its behavior—we never know what our mind is liable to come out like;  it could even be something that could send us to prison. But if we look carefully, we can see that we also have, prior to that, a mind of great wisdom. And as the Buddha says, if we gather everything in our mind into One there is nothing we cannot realize.</p>
<p class="teisho">Those who work with water or those who work with various elements or crafts—they also work with the mind. They don’t just work with the material to specialize in what they make and do; they always know to work with the mind in order to best use those materials, because that is at the bottom of all of it. So to put all of our mind, as the Buddha said, into one simple, single direction and keep our focus strong in that direction—always doing it with the greatest intention.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-3">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">They were free from impurities and afflictions, and all had attained self-mastery.</p>
<p class="teisho">If we let go of all things we are connected to on the outside and free ourselves from all concerns within, then our mind becomes like a tall, straight wall and we are at one with our Path. Or as the Sixth Patriarch has said, to perceive things which are external, we don’t add on any extra thoughts of good or bad. And when we notice anything within, we let go of any judgment or idea about it. Rinzai Zenji says it: “In this five-foot lump of red flesh there is a true person of no rank which is always coming in and going out. If we haven’t seen it yet, see it now!” We are not doing the sesshin here casually, just coming and doing whatever we feel like doing. We take the rules of the ancients and, with the same care with which they provided them for us, we continue and realize that deepest wisdom in the doing of sesshin.</p>
<p class="teisho">The ancients follow the deepest, most profound wisdom. It is from here that society must be brought forth. Each person has to realize their True nature, and then from there see how they themselves are the actual creator of the society. Making sure that no one is in trouble or in pain, taking care of everyone—knowing it is our own responsibility to see that everyone is taken care of—and then to see that it is to bring forth this clarified world that we are born for. To awaken to our own wisdom and then to share this wisdom with others.</p>
<p class="teisho">In the Dhammapada, the words of the Buddha himself, it is said, “How rare it is to have the opportunity to be born as a human being. We forget this so easily!” We still take it for granted. People say that humans are the most evolved and advanced forms of creation. Humans are able to realize this true wisdom. While being born a human, to realize this is a fortunate birth—to keep aware of that! And also, to keep aware of the fact that all of us die; we will die. The Buddha is teaching this, saying this in order to inspire and encourage us to use the inner abilities with which we are all endowed in different ways—to not waste that precious time of being alive but to make use of our time and make use of the abilities and talents with which we are blessed. How rare it is, in a world of deepest darkness, to be able to bring forth light. We receive the Dharma, we receive that wisdom, and we know that we cannot kill even one single insect. Not because of a rule that has been told to us, but because we know, from our deep wisdom in understanding our own life energy, that all life energy born into this world is equal. So how could we kill a single insect?</p>
<p class="teisho">We each have this deep mind within. But not all of us have found the entrance for realizing that wisdom which comes forth from it. This great wisdom we have within is no different from the wisdom of the Buddha. To realize and express this wisdom is the point. We are not a small-minded ego that makes us into two people, but that great, wise mind that includes all of our egoistic facets as well. All of this is included in our wisdom. And then with this deep wisdom we are able to reveal a deep ability which rests within all of us. We have to see that, experience it and then use it for the awakening of all beings.</p>
<p class="teisho">Fifteen hundred years ago Shotoku Daishi wrote the first constitution—the oldest constitution—and the first of a number of things written there was that harmony was best. We have to have peace, or we will not only be unhappy, but everything—the whole world—will dry up. We have to take the Three Treasures [Buddha, Dharma, Sangha] and see them clearly, and respect and revere them. And only there, from giving them our deepest respect, can we wholeheartedly create. There are many different countries, and we cannot try to rule other countries; we cannot have heads of countries that try to rule other countries. Rather, we should observe the rules of mind and respect each country’s way. To see that and respect people from all countries and what they’re doing, we have to let go of our ego view. As long as we are egoistically driven, we cannot see clearly. Rather, to be able to say, “I am so glad I was born!” Without awakening to that true source we cannot see others clearly, accept them and forgive them.</p>
<p class="teisho">This great Mind—we are all this mind, even before our parents were born, prior to anything genetic affecting us. If we can liberate that narrow idea of a personal stance, we can understand all people. There is not something called the Dharma somewhere. As Dogen Zenji said on returning from China where he had gone to look for the Dharma, he had found no such thing as a Buddha Dharma, but what he had found is that the eyes are horizontal above a vertical nose on the face. He did not see anything called “Dharma.” But he had seen from that true source. What had he seen from that true source? He had seen “that the sun rises in the East and the moon sets in the West, that the roosters crow at the break of dawn and every four years a Leap Year comes around.” </p>
<p class="teisho">For this world to be, the natural ways have to happen. And who has destroyed these natural ways now? It’s humans with their ignorance and their selfishness. If we were to live from the place where we see that “there is a sun rising in the East and the moon setting in the West, the roosters crow at the break of dawn and every four years a Leap Year comes”—this is the true Law, and it cannot be opposed, but humans have been doing so and it has been a big mistake.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Three Treasures need to be respected and the truth has to be clearly seen, not as a matter of form, but so that we do not work in this mistaken way. To open our mind completely to see and become this, is what the Vimalakirti Sutra is teaching us.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Three</p>
<p class="teisho">Today we are continuing to read about the Buddha lands. Everywhere the Buddha’s teaching is heard—that is a Buddha land. It is not a physical location or country but a state of mind with a deep understanding of human nature. Building a Buddha land is not like building a country with a society and systems for how to run a country. The Buddha land is the care of the mind—living in the best place for everyone. This is the place where, because people have so much greediness and seeking of self-satisfaction, they are not usually able to reside. But there is a perfect state of mind, and this needs to be clarified for it to be called the Buddha land.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-4">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, recognized by the congregation. </p>
<p class="sutra">3. The [bodhisattvas present] had all accomplished the original practices of great wisdom; were established by the numinous charisma of the buddhas; maintained the correct Dharma for the defense of the Dharma city; made their names heard throughout the ten directions through their ability at the lion’s roar; befriended and pacified people without being requested; exalted the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) and were thus able to keep them from being cut off; subjugated the vengeful Māras and controlled those of the heterodox paths; </p>
<p class="teisho">We here have the bodhisattvas who are attending, knowing the teachings to be pure. </p>
<p class="teisho">Our mind is always getting attached to something and losing its freedom. The ego comes in and puts a lid on our hugeness of mind. So what is it that puts that lid on?</p>
<p class="teisho">For what are we born? To be a realized Buddha and awaken to that deep wisdom within. To be able to remember that the universe (which came into being 16 billion years ago), the earth (which came into being 4.5 billion years ago), and then the Life energy from which we come, all came into being just once. It began just once and it has to complete itself, to fulfill itself, to where all beings are awakened to this deepest wisdom, with no one left out. For this all of us have to be abundantly-minded beings. To become this, we have to know shame in not evolving in the way that we could. Humans can see what we are still lacking and see what is still unevolved in ourselves, what is still unawakened in ourselves. This is a particular quality of human nature. Seeing this makes us regret that we haven’t evolved further. And because we have this regret, we know the shame of not doing everything we could. That makes us work harder, go further with what we have not yet seen clearly. </p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha said to his disciples who were always sleeping, to not waste that precious life energy but to realize their true, deep wisdom. To do this we have to put everything into it, throw ourselves entirely into it, and to use the least amount of time possible for sleep.</p>
<p class="teisho">Losing track of ourselves and clinging to someone else instead of deeply realizing our greater being, we stay caught in a small self. And in that small self version, we always hold back, not wanting to give everything, not being willing to dive in completely; so instead we hold onto someone else.</p>
<p class="teisho">To become angered easily and quickly; to not see clearly through everything that is in front of us and that which we experience; to have an ongoing upset and discordant mind; to have an ongoing angry mind even if it isn’t being expressed; to have a depressed and un-free way of looking at things; to become overly-indulgent in our sleeping. These are the things that hold us back.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha was a very wise psychologist and taught many helpful things like this. The bodhisattvas that are being talked about here were all free from these indulgences and weaknesses. These bodhisattvas who were gathered had all done their homework, and they were all free and realized in these many different aspects. One of these aspects was that in each and every mind-moment they were fresh, there were no shadows lingering. And so every world they would find themselves in was seen clearly.</p>
<p class="teisho">We are always adding on dualistic ideas to what we perceive, and that is what is impure. To perceive in a way that is correct for what we are looking at, to be not adding in anything that is extra, is what is most important.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-5">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present] ... were entirely purified and had forever transcended the impediments (i.e., afflictions); </p>
<p class="teisho">There are five indulgences and ten weaknesses. Those five indulgences are indulgence in greed, in anger, in sleep, in agitation, and in doubts.  The Buddha was always teaching about how we cannot waste time. We have been given this precious life, and our time is like sand, slipping through our fingers. We have to see this clearly and not waste it by sleeping any more than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have greediness for sleep; we have anger and irritation; we have doubts and suspicions about things, including the teachings; and we also have indecision—not being able to see clearly and see through to what we have to do and what is around us. And we also have the ten fetters that hold us back. </p>
<p class="teisho">We have the bond where we do not see the lack of wisdom in our actions. We don’t see ourselves clearly and are unable to be embarrassed or ashamed or regretful of what we’re doing. The second is that we don’t review our behavior; we live as our animal side encourages us to, and instead of seeing that as holding us back from evolving into our higher potential, we don’t have any sense of that being something needing to be examined, reviewed, or changed.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-6">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present]... maintained their minds always in peace and unhindered emancipation; were unfailing in their mindfulness, concentration, dhāraṇī (i.e., memorization of the Dharma), and eloquence;</p>
<p class="teisho">The second characteristic of the bodhisattvas is to have a Pure mind that is always clear, not worrying and concerned about what might happen in the future, but staying in the present. This is to not leave anything remaining in our state of mind instead to be completely present in each moment. Next, we have the words “to not do bad things” but to instead “do good things”—to live in that clarified state of mind.</p>
<p class="teisho">These ways of being come to us of their own, and we are naturally bright and abundant then. We do the practice of becoming completely whatever we are doing.  In the zendo we become the zazen completely.  If it is cleaning, we become the cleaning completely.  If it is eating, we become the eating completely. And then our mind is not flaccid and does not get caught or attached easily.</p>
<p class="teisho">One person said that they were walking in the temple grounds when two monks suddenly met on a path. Without speaking aloud, they bowed deeply to each other and then continued walking. This clear and clean way of relating to people—if it is not like this, we are always wondering what is the meaning of practise, what we are practicing for?</p>
<p class="teisho">Then there is the way of speaking clearly, simply, and to the point; for example, welcoming and sending off guests with a few appropriate words fully expressing our gratitude that they have come, but not just flattering people and saying what we think they want to hear. Rather, to honor each and every moment of encountering.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-7">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present] ... were replete in charity (dāna), morality (śīla), forbearance (kṣānti), exertion (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), wisdom (prajñā), and the power of skillful means; had attained the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas and the nonattainment [of all things];</p>
<p class="teisho">The Six Paramitas are listed—that of charity, of following the precepts, of patience, of good efforts, of samadhi, and of deep wisdom. The first is charity: to make offerings to each other makes our mind and our world harmonious; in this way we will believe in each other. These can be both Dharma offerings or material offerings. The Dharma kind of offerings come from within, like the offering of wisdom. The material offerings are things of form. There is also a third: the offering of fearlessness, like that state of mind of many babies. The baby offers a fearless mind and a deep smile, and there is no one who is not touched by the purity of that state of mind. Because we always offer these to each other, we can believe in and have deep faith in each other.</p>
<p class="teisho">We give things, but we also give what are not material things, such as a look with kindness in our eyes, a state of mind of being and speaking which is not jagged and nasty. To be kind in our way of speaking and being. To have a supportive and cooperative state of mind. It all has to be done with our deep mind expressed there, and to give our clear, bright mind freely and charitably. This is how we offer everything to society.</p>
<p class="teisho">We all have challenges and painful matters, but we offer all of that right up to society as well. If we can do this, we will naturally know how to behave. In this way the world works. As they say in an expression from China, “What goes around comes around.” We support each other in this way on our Path—that deep Path of Clear mind. </p>
<p class="teisho">Then we have the second Paramita which is the Precepts. Like planting seeds in the spring and harvesting in the autumn, the precepts follow natural laws. To be able to plant the seed, offer it sunshine and rain, and bring forth its harvest—this is a natural support for the seed. In the same way we observe the precepts of the heavens and the earth. For humans these are the precepts, for example, of not killing life, not stealing, not lying, being clear and bright in our relationships, and not being intoxicated. To not destroy life, to not take things and call them our own personal things, to be direct and clear with all people, to not be confused and deluded by alcoholic beverages or by other things either— not to be intoxicated by using too many things, not to be intoxicated by drinking things in a way that makes us unclear and confused.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have to have patience, the next of the Six Paramitas. For realizing deepest wisdom, we have to endure at times. When we get old and sick we need this practice of having known how to become patient. Having that patience we can realize the necessary spaciousness of mind. Patience is basic for this, and we have to work on this creatively.</p>
<p class="teisho">Next we have making efforts, like those in all things of nature. And the same is true of our own efforts.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have samadhi. All the other five paramitas come within this. As the Sixth Patriarch has said, to not add on anything—any judgment or idea of good and bad—to what we perceive externally, since it is all just phenomena. Instead to realize this ongoing, transformative flow by diving in, yet not being attached to, what we are encountering. This is samadhi. We so easily get harried and agitated. We have to keep our ki low, keep it down so we can be settled no matter what comes along, and forget our body and our thoughts completely to where we no longer realize any separation between ourselves and the zendo, for example—our five senses and the world around us matching perfectly. This is true wisdom—meeting each encounter with no seam between self and other, self and what is being met. In all the boundless realms of space there is not room for a single hair to be inserted.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-8">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present] ... were able to accord with [the truth] in turning the irreversible wheel [of the Dharma]; understood well the characteristics of the dharmas and understood the capacities (lit., “roots”) of sentient beings; had attained fearlessness in sheltering the great congregations; cultivated their minds with merit and wisdom; were paramount in the adornment of [537a7] their bodies with the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks; </p>
<p class="teisho">Further, to not be caught on a small personal sense of who we are. As Daruma Daishi said in his writings on <span class="Italic">The Two-Way Entrance to the Path</span>, there is nothing to be possessed whatsoever. In the Buddha’s teachings on the Fourfold Truth, the first truth is that our suffering comes from gathering; we gather friends, we gather things, we gather ideas. To not gather and to not be attached is the way to be free from suffering. As Daruma Daishi also said in his profound precepts, from the deepest, most profound, Clear mind and True nature, there is nothing that belongs to us whatsoever. As Ikyu Zenji said in his final words, “This body which I have borrowed for these many years, up until this time, this day, I now return it.” To make this body useful for many people instead of selfishly wanting it to be something which owns many things personally, and not to speak and think in terms of “my things,” “my land,” “my doings,” “my possessions.” To get things, people even kill and steal, when they are not our own in the first place. And in the doing of that we lose track of our True nature.</p>
<p class="teisho">If we open up to our mind as it is—just as it is—then we will see this world just as it is. This is the spacious way of mind beyond any attachment whatsoever. If we see beyond the possessiveness of things, then we see that even the ugliest and angriest person we know will also die like we will. And seeing from this spacious state of mind—this is the true way to encounter and meet each thing and person.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Oh great Mind, </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">It is impossible to measure the height of the heavens!<br/>Yet the mind is above the heavens. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">It is impossible to measure the thickness of the earth, <br/>Yet the mind is below the earth.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">The sun and the moon shine with a great radiance, <br/>Yet the mind is the source of that radiance. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Within the mind the four seasons open in their sequence.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Within the mind the sun and the moon move. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Oh great Mind!</p>
<p class="teisho">This is from the writings of Eisai Zenji. To realize this huge state of mind is zazen. And if we can realize this, then we can live in our True nature.</p>
<p class="teisho">Vimalakirti is using this section on the purification of Buddha lands to teach this ideal way of being and living. We each have to see this within and align accordingly. This is how it is clarified here.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Four</p>
<p class="teisho">This teaching about the construction of Buddha lands is not about the construction of a physical form. If our minds are peaceful and harmonious, these are also Buddha lands, and the Buddha land which is a form becomes peaceful and harmonious. More than the material form of a Buddha land, that form is the quiet in our mind; we are each then that place of Buddha. And what is the mind’s Buddha nature? How do we receive it? If people in the world suffer, then we are also sick. In this way there is no difference at all between the world—the society—and how we are. It is the same with the Buddha lands. Always with those who are not yet awakened, helping them to awaken! And then the Wheel turns. It always works much better when there are at least two people doing something that is as big as this. And in this way we meet people and we do it together, and then things come together in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="teisho">What is the truth? What is that which each of us has to work on? If we look within we can see that we’re still needing to work on different places and how we’re still lacking in deeper awakening. People who lag behind have to be encouraged to go faster. People who are carelessly fast—we have to help them and support them to slow down and be more careful. People who are very slow, to remind them how life passes so quickly. To show the place where fear is not necessary, so that each person can, without fear, awaken and join forces and help each other. There is no place where everything is already aligned. There is always work to do. We work on it together; we support each other and we bring these things into alignment.</p>
<p class="teisho">People are all alike in that we each think that we are the most special person. Even though we say that we are so lacking and terrible, actually, deep inside we believe that we are the most adorable. If we are ignored we get confused and upset.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha also said that it is up to us to align our face and our appearance—the Buddha, who was spoken of as having thirty-two special marks and eighty special features. We have to do this from within. It’s nothing you can achieve from trying in an external way, it is not like becoming more like a movie star’s face. Instead, become the face that no matter how difficult a situation we have to face, to be not moved around and to have a still face that is in clarity. The Buddha said that to work on our patience is of great importance. To not get angry and to keep our face aligned—to let it all go; no matter what the pain and suffering, to stay settled and clear.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have in the United States a story from Abraham Lincoln’s time at the end of the Civil War. There were not so many people around to help out with things, and good people were hard to find. There was a person whom a friend of Abraham Lincoln suggested that he could use for his work. But when President Lincoln met him, he turned him down. His friend was curious and asked why he didn’t want to use that person who was so brilliant and able to work so well. President Lincoln said, “I didn’t like his face.” So his friend said, “But his face came from his parents—that’s not his fault.” President Lincoln answered, “Yes, but who is it that is carrying that face? One who does not care about others has the kind of face that shows that they don’t care about others. As the President of a country I have to see what is best for everyone. It’s not about my own personal choice in who is around me.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Another person once said that life is a workshop for making one’s face. Tolstoy, the famous author who wrote War and Peace—a huge, complex masterpiece. Someone commented that for Tolstoy as well, more than his great writings, his best work was his face. He had a face that was moved by nothing. He called this face Tolstoy’s true masterpiece. To be humble, to be helpful and see what we can do best for other people, and of course, in the doing of that a good face comes.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-9">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present] ... had dispensed with worldly adornments; were known above and beyond even Mount Sumeru; were firmly resolute in faith like vajra (i.e., diamond); illuminated the Dharma jewel everywhere and rained down the sweet dew [of the Dharma]; were paramount in the subtleties of the host of [spoken] sounds; profoundly entered into conditioned generation to eliminate the false views; were without any residual influence of the two extremes of being and nonbeing; </p>
<p class="teisho">The bodhisattvas are those who let go of all decoration and adornment. People so like to dress with decoration and adornment, where to dress for hot or cold or a special occasion should be plenty. People even put on evening dresses costing thousands of dollars. But bodhisattvas don’t wear clothing like that. The Buddha had three robes—for hot weather, cold weather, and for speaking on special occasions in front of other people. These robes and one set of eating bowls were all he had. And everything else was given to society. For his clothes he used what others didn’t need anymore and discarded. Always keeping what he wore clean, using a strong cloth, letting go of the weak parts and then sewing it together to be strong and designed to support the places where it would get weak from wear, carefully patching and cleaning, and not wasting any cloth. This pattern that he sewed his robes in was called “clothing of fortunate rice field pattern.” Always wearing quiet, simple, clean clothes, he dressed this way and lived this way. So he was believed in and respected.</p>
<p class="teisho">He was always polishing his state of mind, and in this way he was a refuge and a mirror for all people and for society. He was always polishing—an exemplary person for all people in society. This is the way of finding joy in the truth. He would find great joy in this deep wisdom, and naturally want to share its joy and happiness with other people. So no matter what, he was sharing this joy of the Dharma. </p>
<p class="teisho">Usually our precious possessions are things and objects, and that is our way of making ourselves happy. Instead, be happy without things and know the deeper joy of being alive. If we are near a person who is like that we are able to receive their serenity. We feel it. The first time we feel it we are deeply impressed. And just sitting down together, this quiets us. The quietness is received and deepens.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-10">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">[The bodhisattvas present] ... preached the Dharma without fear like the lion’s roar; preached with reverberations like thunder; were without measure and beyond measurement; were like ocean captains who had collected the many Dharma jewels; comprehended the profound and wondrous meanings of the Dharmas; understood well the past tendencies and [current] mental processes of sentient beings; approached the unparalleled autonomous wisdom of the Buddha, the ten powers, [the four] fearlessnesses, and all the eighteen exclusive [attributes of the Buddha]; had closed all the doorways of the evil destinations but were born in the five destinations in order to manifest their bodies there; were great medicine kings who were good at healing the various illnesses; provided medicine according to the illness and caused it to be taken; were accomplished in all the immeasurable merits; had ornamented and purified all the immeasurable Buddha lands; unfailingly used what they saw and heard for the benefit [of others]; and never squandered away their endeavors. Thus were they entirely replete in all merits.</p>
<p class="teisho">[The Roshi] has a friend who is the head of a police department. He does zazen every morning before he goes to work, chanting the heart sutra—not even looking at a paper or any kind of news or having any other kind of input before he gets into his car and goes off to his office. And when he goes into this big office, again before he even looks at the paper or the work of the day, he goes immediately to the jail and he says “Good morning!” to the people there. They are very annoyed about being there in the first place and they don’t answer, just a cold, resentful silence at first. After three days or so, a slightly less resentful, mumbled answer of  “Good morning” is returned. And after a little while more, if he doesn’t come, then they ask where he is that day. After two or three weeks he leaves a newspaper for them; they say they don’t want to read anything like that, and they refuse it. And awhile after that, a book about mind, something which is deeply meaningful. Eventually they pick it up and read it; they get it, and they like the book and they ask for more books like that. They had never seen such a book, didn’t know they existed, having read only the parts of the newspaper they liked up until that time. It takes time. But more and more, if there is a Clear mind it will be responded to by another Clear mind.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha’s teaching about the world was that everything comes forth in accordance with cause and effect. He taught that there is nothing absolute in the whole world; everything, without exception, is always changing and in flux. So how <span class="Italic">do</span> things change, and in what way does this change occur? There is always a source, there is always a cause. And about that cause and about that source, there are many conditions that affect it. In accordance with the conditions that affect that source, that cause: from there a result comes forth. Things will always change in accordance with this. Like the plants: we plant a wheat seed in the ground. That would be the first cause—planting that wheat seed. Then we have the conditions that it needs to grow, such as the right amount of rain and sunlight. Then we get a sprout; that’s the result. But there is nothing eternal about this. </p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha was very strongly opposed to two theories: one, that there is an ongoing, continuing, after-death soul; and two, that there is nothing at all. Rather, he said that there is a cause, there are conditions, and the result of those, and these keep changing. Not to say there is a something, nor to say that there is not anything at all, but rather there is this formula in which we have a cause, conditions that affect that cause, and the results. This cuts away all egoistic ideas of nihilistic flavor or of believing in an eternally continuing something.</p>
<p class="teisho">With our various experiences we continue to clarify True Mind. We keep the center clear. Although we read and study, instead of getting caught and dragged down by what we read and study we have to ask, “What are they really trying to say?” and see through to the greater point. If not, then we will lose any real meaning in what we are reading and studying. The bodhisattvas could see through all of this, and in that way were like the fishermen who know where all the fish are, or the people who know where the treasures are buried. Like people who go fishing under the instruction and intuition of one who knows the waters well—a fisherman who has fished them often—the bodhisattvas know well how to guide people in this way.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Six Realms through which people rotate—we have the Realm of Hell, in which it is impossible to believe in anything; the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts, of always wanting more and more no matter how much we have already been given; the Realm of the Human, to always be reviewing our behavior, ashamed and embarrassed about what we have done but able to work and improve on it; the Realm of the Demons; the Realm of the Heavenly Beings, forgetting everything and spending time pleasantly, yet still in that place where there is no deep, continual awakening. And so again we return to go through the others again and again, always revolving around these realms. But as we move through these states we simultaneously work on clarifying our True Mind. In this way, we come forth from that deep mud of attachment to become like a pure lotus. While we are still full of greed and terror and anger in the various realms, the bodhisattvas see this clearly and give the appropriate medicine for us to be able to move through those realms and let go of the attachments.</p>
<p class="teisho">While working, to not even think that we are working; in some way, whatever way, to liberate others all the time, in one straight line, standing, sitting, waking, sleeping—never stopping. This is the way of the bodhisattva. Never ending in their deep vow to help all beings become liberated, these are bodhisattvas. Those who were gathered there were bodhisattvas, and those who can build a Buddha land are bodhisattvas. As they gathered, the land of the Buddha was being built of itself. </p>
<p class="teisho">A person once asked Confucius—and it must have been a very clever person—“What is necessary for a country to stand?” To this, Confucius answered, “The military, food, and deep faith.” It must have been a very clever person indeed, because they continued, and they asked, “If you could take away one of those things and still have a country to stand, what is the first thing you would take away?” To this, Confucius answered, “The military.” And then he said that the second was food—if only one thing could be left it would be the deepest faith. Without that faith the country would not last for one day. Today it seems to have become just the opposite. We have a lot of military, a lot of food, and no faith in our government at all. In the Buddha land we have the deepest faith, and it is in accordance with that that the karmic affiliations are strengthened.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Five</p>
<p class="teisho">Continuing, we have the pages that have all the names on them:</p>
<h4 id="sutra-11">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">4. Their names were <br/>Equivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Inequivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Equivalent-Inequivalent Contemplation Bodhisattva, Autonomy of Meditation King Bodhisattva, Autonomous Dharma King Bodhisattva, Dharma Characteristic Bodhisattva, Radiance Characteristic Bodhisattva, Radiance Ornament Bodhisattva, Great Ornament Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Jewels Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Eloquence Bodhisattva, Jewel Hand Bodhisattva, Jewel Seal Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Raised Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Lowered Hand Bodhisattva, Constantly Lamenting Bodhisattva, Roots of Joy Bodhisattva, Joy King Bodhisattva, Eloquent Sound Bodhisattva, Store of Space Bodhisattva, Holding the Jewel Torch Bodhisattva, Jewel Courage Bodhisattva, Jewel Vision Bodhisattva, Indra’s Net Bodhisattva, Illumination Net Bodhisattva, Unconditional Contemplation Bodhisattva, Accumulation of Wisdom Bodhisattva, Excellent Jewel Bodhisattva, Heavenly King Bodhisattva, Destroyer of Māra Bodhisattva, Lightning-like Virtue Bodhisattva, Autonomous King Bodhisattva, Ornament of the Characteristics of Merit Bodhisattva, Lion’s Roar Bodhisattva, Sound of Thunder Bodhisattva, Sound Striking the Mountains Bodhisattva, Fragrant Elephant Bodhisattva, White Fragrant Elephant Bodhisattva, Constant Exertion Bodhisattva, Unresting Bodhisattva, Wondrous Birth Bodhisattva, Flower Ornament Bodhisattva, Contemplates the Sounds of the World (Avalokiteśvara) Bodhisattva, Attains Great Strength Bodhisattva, Brahmā’s Net Bodhisattva, Jewel Staff Bodhisattva, Undefeated Bodhisattva, Ornamented Earth Bodhisattva, Golden Crest Bodhisattva, Pearl Crest Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī Dharma Prince Bodhisattva—there were thirty-two thousand such as these.</p>
<p class="teisho">Later, in the chapter on “Not Two”, the bodhisattvas are introduced more specifically. Here we just have them named, and only some of the 32,000 which are said to have been there. Actually, only the senior and most remarkable ones were named here for this teaching of the Buddha. Now the Buddha is going to arrive, just like the Himalayan mountains rising high above at Gion Shoja where the Diamond Sutra was also taught. All the disciples at first were gathered around the Buddha, and around the disciples were the bodhisattvas, and around the bodhisattvas were all the gods and the protector beings.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-12">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">5. There were also ten thousand Brahmā heavenly kings, Śikhin and others, who descended from the other worlds of four continents to proceed to where the Buddha was in order to hear the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand heavenly emperors (i.e., Indras), who also came from the other worlds of four continents to sit in this assembly, and the other awesomely powerful gods (devas), dragons (nāgas), yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, who all came to sit in the assembly. The bhikṣus (monks), bhikṣunis (nuns), upāsakas (laymen), and upāsikās (laywomen) [also] came together to sit in the assembly.</p>
<p class="sutra">6. At that time the Buddha explained the Dharma for the congregation of immeasurable hundreds of thousands surrounding and revering him. He was like [Mount] Sumeru, the king of mountains, rising high above the ocean. Peacefully seated on the many-jeweled lion seat, he towered over the great congregation of all those who had come there.</p>
<p class="sutra">7. At that time there was an elder’s son in the city of Vaisali named Jewel Accumulation [Ratnakara]. He and five hundred other elders’ sons proceeded to where the Buddha was, holding canopies made of the seven treasures. Reverencing [the Buddha’s] feet with their heads, they all simultaneously offered their canopies to the Buddha.</p>
<p class="teisho">Five hundred sons, led by one wealthy man’s son, all from illustrious families, each brought a parasol made of seven different kinds of jewels because they were sons of wealthy families. India is so hot, the umbrellas are about two meters in width, with a long handle which is then laid down and able to give shade. They are still used today. This offering of parasols is still practiced, which [the Roshi] has seen when he was in India.</p>
<p class="teisho">With both elbows and both knees and the forehead to the ground, prostrations are given to the Buddha nature; it is not to some Buddha statue or some image of a Buddha—not to anything external to be thankful to — no such symbol. This is why at the One Drop Zendos we always have a great circle <span class="Italic">[enso]</span> which we use instead of having a Buddha image or statue. Prostrations express our honoring and our realizing of the Buddha nature.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-13">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">8. The Buddha’s numinous charisma made the jewel-laden canopies all turn into a single canopy, which covered the entire tri‑mega‑chiliocosm, yet allowing all the characteristics of the breadth and length of this world to appear within it. <br/>Also, all the tri‑mega‑chiliocosm’s Mount Sumerus, Snowy  Mountains, Mucilinda Mountains, Mahāmucilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jewel Mountains, Golden Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Ring Mountains, and Great Iron Ring Mountains; the oceans, rivers, streams, and springs; the suns, moons, and stars; the palaces of the gods, the palaces of the dragons, and the palaces of the honored gods—all these appeared within that jewel-laden canopy. Also, the buddhas of the ten directions, as well as the buddhas’ preaching of the Dharma, also appeared in that jewel-laden canopy.</p>
<p class="sutra">9. At that time the entire great congregation observed the numinous power of the Buddha and exclaimed in praise of its unprecedented [quality]. They held their palms together and reverenced the Buddha, gazing up at his revered countenance without interruption.</p>
<p class="teisho">As soon as these precious parasols had been laid down, suddenly, by the miraculous power of the Lord, they were transformed into a single precious canopy so great that it formed a covering for this entire billion world galaxy. The surface of the entire billion world galaxy was reflected in the interior of the great precious canopy, for the total content of this galaxy could be seen: limitless mansions of suns, moons and stellar bodies, the realms of the <span class="Italic">devas, ragas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas </span>as well as the realms of the four Maharajas.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha was offered these parasols, which he took—all of them—and gathered into one great parasol, as if with a sleight-of-hand magician’s move. All the heavenly gods then appeared. All the five hundred parasols gathered into one—the whole universe was then gathered there. Being given a precious parasol was an offering to the Buddha which represented the deepest, greatest faith and sincere mind of each of the young people. Buddha put these gathered, offered minds into one great Mind. All people have this one great Mind which is like a huge circle; the Buddha brought them all together into one.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Oh great Mind, it is impossible to measure the height of the heavens!<br/>Yet the mind is above the heavens. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">It is impossible to measure the thickness of the earth, <br/>Yet the mind is below the earth.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">The sun and the moon shine with a great radiance, <br/>Yet the mind is the source of that radiance. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Within the mind the four seasons open in their sequence.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Within the mind the sun and the moon move. </p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Oh great Mind!</p>
<p class="teisho">This great Mind with which we are all endowed—if we try to put it out there, it just comes out as an ego-expression about it. Yet even though we cannot put it out, it is, as Master Rinzai has said, “The true Dharma has no form, and yet it extends in all the ten directions.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Just as that moon high in the sky is written about in the Zen Phrases, if we have ten thousand bodies of water, in them there will be ten thousand moons. If there are a thousand bodies of water, they will also all reflect the moon. The moon will be reflected in the water, but only if the water is not turbulent. This is not about the water’s content, but about whether or not there are waves in it. If there are, then it cannot correctly reflect the moon; like our mind, when it has many thoughts it cannot perceive precisely. When we are serene and without any ideas in our mind, then the moon in the high heavens can be reflected in the water exactly as it is. If our mind is clear like that—clear like that clear circle, that huge circle—that can be reflected there. If that is enlarged, then it becomes the whole universe. Yet it is not empty. It holds onto nothing, yet it reflects everything precisely. Everything in this universe—even the smallest and largest thing—is reflected there. Our mind becomes one and the same with what it reflects if there are no obstructing thoughts. The same for the Buddha and the same for now: “In all the boundless realms of space, there is not a place for a single hair to be inserted.” But if we add on anything mental, or hold on to it, it does not reflect clearly. This is the truth.</p>
<p class="teisho">Having received the parasols, the teaching of the truth was given, showing it by example with the gathering of the parasols and their becoming one. Then, in this particular style and quality of the Vimalakirti Sutra—how it comes through the eyes and is taught visually as well as through the hearing—everyone saw the actuality of what the Buddha was talking about by what he did. Everyone attending was awakened by this truth and, as is the custom in India, a gatha or a song was then given:</p>
<h4 id="sutra-14">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">10. At this the elder’s son Jewel Accumulation proclaimed in verse before the Buddha:</p>
<p class="SutraVerse">1. Your eyes are pure,  <br/>And as large as blue lotuses;  <br/>Your mind is pure, having mastered the concentrations.  <br/>Long have you accumulated pure action—you are immeasurably praiseworthy;  <br/>You have guided the congregation with serenity, and therefore we bow our heads to you.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha’s exquisite appearance is extolled here. The blue, lotus-like eyes—actually a blue-white-ish color in the actual blooming lotus of this sort. With eyes the shape of a lotus petal, his appearance is praised.</p>
<p class="teisho">Not a single speck of anything in his Clear mind, he would always enter his teaching from samadhi. This was from his lengthy becoming; a Buddha is not suddenly produced. Such was Amida Nyorai, for whom it took three long kalpas to become Amida Nyorai. The Buddha, who had thrown away everything, whose path began by letting go of a whole life as a prince, of dear family at a castle, his wife and child, that whole country, in order to go to Dantoku Mountain where he did ascetic training for six years, eating one grain of rice and the pine nuts that were there until on the eighth of December, at the age of thirty-five, he was deeply awakened. His struggles were immeasurable up until that time. But from that time on he was always in samadhi.</p>
<p class="teisho">In describing the long time that the Buddha trained, it is said that he did eight thousand trips back and forth to the furthest ends of the universe. It is said that he did this training for all of us. He shaved away his body and his being for all of us, and we cannot misuse this precious chance we have been given to be able to deepen our understanding. The central point of this is always deep serenity. </p>
<p class="teisho">Today in so many religions they have moved away from that serenity using bright images, loud music and synthesizers. Yet see how even in martial arts before they begin the practice of their forms they sit quietly, silently. We also can’t just sit our body down while having a busy mind. Both our body and mind being serene—this is zazen. And so it becomes this deep state of mind.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-15">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">2. We see the Great Sage use numinous transformations  <br/>To manifest the immeasurable lands throughout the ten directions,  <br/>Within which the buddhas preach the Dharma,  <br/>And we thus can see and hear them all!</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha had rolled all of the parasols into one, showing the oneness of all things. Like today when we have computer screens where we can see the whole universe on them. In the olden days we took one moon, one sun, one galaxy, the planets, and stars, and this is one Buddha land. Each Buddha land has one Buddha in it, and these are written about to show the huge expanse of this, of what is being included here.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-16">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">3. The Dharma power of the Dharma King surpasses all other beings,  <br/>And you always give the wealth of Dharma to all.  <br/>Well do you discriminate the characteristics of the dharmas and remain unmoved within the cardinal principle.  <br/>You have already achieved autonomy with regard to the dharmas, and therefore we bow our heads to you as Dharma King.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Dharma king is Shakyamuni Buddha, who has realized the whole truth completely and therefore can teach appropriately to anyone and everyone, whether they are sad or unhappy or miserable. In the whole world, having all of the possible ingredients necessary to liberate all beings—that happening because he can see the truth so deeply and thoroughly—we give great honor to him.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-17">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">4. You explain that the dharmas are neither extant nor non-extant,  <br/>Although the dharmas are generated from causes and conditions; <br/>That they are without self, without creation, without experiencer,  <br/>Although good and evil karma is also not extinguished.</p>
<p class="teisho">These words have already been given—how it is the Dharma of karma affiliation. </p>
<p class="teisho">The Dharma has three standing parts, ways of being put. The first is that about existing. There has to be a color for something to exist, or we cannot perceive it. Light and shade is necessary for this. And so we use the word “color” to mean that something is perceived. Since it has a color, we can recognize it; it has rules that we recognize—the way something exists—as a bird, or as a fish. A bird is something which flies, a fish is something which swims in the water. </p>
<p class="teisho">Each and every thing has a color and rules about what and how it is being. Also, everything is constantly changing, never staying the same, never stagnant. All existence is in flux: all the flowers, the running rivers changing continually.  We think that rocks look so permanent, but they, too, change with the raindrops falling on them. One drop after the next in the same place, and the rock becomes smaller. So there is color and form and change, and these rules are rules for what exists.There is always movement. Nothing can be fixed. There is no exact beginning nor an exact ending. </p>
<p class="teisho">In India, those objects made of matter were thought to come forth from the four elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. These elements were the source of all things; everything would come under these categories. If we take a plant seed and plant it in the ground under the best circumstances and we have the water and the sunshine, then we can continue to bring forth these seeds endlessly, if we continue giving them their best circumstances. The Dharma is like this. So is the flower. While it exists, it also does not exist. It exists in one form but it is not that form eternally. This existence is something which appears to be existing. But in fact it is always going through change. The rivers flow and we have the sky as it is. While never stopping changing—it’s not about a “good” or a “bad”—that is the way of the laws of all existence.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-18">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">That they are without self, without creation, without experiencer,  <br/>Although good and evil karma is also not extinguished.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have a house, but in fact there is no such thing which can be extrapolated from that which is a house. It is, in fact, a combination of—a collection of—parts of a house. There is a roof, there is a floor, there are walls and windows, but there is no such thing as a house—only its parts that are gathered together. This is true of all of us. We are only our parts. All of our definition is in the listing of our parts. We are parts. We are cells. We are cells that become bones, we are cells that become lymph fluid, or cells that become organs or become blood or parts of a brain. We are all only our parts. There’s nothing that can be shown that is called a “me,” nor can it be called an “I.” There is not a becoming, nor is there an existing thing which is a “me” or an “I.” All of us are simply a collection of the various parts. And there is no god who creates it. We appear to exist but before that gathering of parts there was no such “me” existing. Our physical body comes into being with a karmic cause that brings all of these parts together, and we also fade away through karmic cause.</p>
<p class="teisho">Then if we are not existing, what is it that moves? That which moves through us—that is called karma. Whether it is a good collection or a bad collection, that is according to the karmic affiliation—like energy, which also has an effect but cannot be seen. And this energy’s activity does not ever change in any era; the rules of how it works are always the same in every era. Karmic affiliation does affect it. So if we have a vow to build a Buddha land, that does affect how the energy works. It also is an aspect of the karmic affiliation. To gather all these parts together in the best possible way—this is what the gatha is teaching us.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">We are what we think, having become what we thought; Like the wheel that follows the cart-pulling ox, Sorrow follows an evil thought.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">We are what we think, having become what we thought; Like the shadow that never leaves one, Happiness follows a pure thought.</p>
<p class="teisho">These are the first and second stanzas of the Dhammapada’s linked verses— that good causes bring good effects, bad causes bring bad effects. It’s up to us what we choose and decide. </p>
<p class="teisho">If we go on to describe the essence of that Dharma, it is all beings, which are ever changing and without fixed form and shape. All things are in constant flux and there is nothing that is eternal. Therefore, for all things it can be said that they don’t exist either, there is no absolute existence. However, we can say that it is that very constant change, that flux, that does exist. No matter what kind of thing it is, it goes through changes, it is in motion, in flux. If it has color, moves, and works according to a law, it has existence—this is the definition. Buddha said that all things that have existence are governed by the laws of cause and effect.</p>
<p class="teisho">In existence there is always a cause, and with the addition of the karmic connection a result is born. This result becomes the next cause; karma is added and the next result is born from that. All things are tied together by a vast karmic connection and only appear to exist separately. When that karmic connection is completed it returns to the original “ku” or “void, emptiness”. This is why it can’t be said that things absolutely exist, nor can it be said that they don’t exist. In a temporarily borrowed form, they stay in flux, changing constantly, with no concrete or fixed existence. For this reason, in this world there is nothing which controls and nothing which is controlled, only the working of the continuing laws of cause and effect.</p>
<p class="teisho">This is what the Buddha taught—these are the natural laws that he realized are at work and taught about. At the same time the Buddha understood well how this physical body also comes forth from karmic causes; how it is affected by karmic causes, and although it seems to exist, that Mind which thinks of itself as an “I” is also something which only comes about from karmic causes; in other words, there is no such thing as an “I” that has an absolute existence.</p>
<p class="teisho">For those who have actually experienced this for themselves, there is no longer any confusion about this transient world, this deluded world. If we see from these eyes, there is no such separation or differentiation as a “self” from an “other.” “Self,” “other,” they are all of an equivalent world that is not created and not controlled, from before the beginning of the limitless past, the rules of cause and effect are simply perpetually in constant motion. For this reason, since there is no separation between self and other, society is always our “self”; our “self” is always society. This actual experience is understood and realized.</p>
<p class="teisho">In the world of Zen, we don’t think of God or Buddha as providing us with our food. As we live within society, we have to ask ourselves if we really made the efforts that deserve this food. We must understand the great amount of energy that was necessary to bring that food to us, to be thankful for all those benefits that made our meals possible. For us to thoroughly chew and digest the actual reality in front of us; this must be the essence of our training. The Buddha would not even permit an imagination of a world like this. He was free from ego attachment which could attempt to control him. There was also no absolute being who imagined this world. </p>
<p class="teisho">The teaching of the Buddha on cause and effect showed that karma was the form of expression through which these are disclosed. Karma is not the existence of some certain special thing. Since things exist in this world according to a cause and its effects, if we plant good seeds we can get a good flow moving. If we plant bad seeds they bring forth a bad flow. The words “good causes bring good results, bad causes bring bad results” come from this. Today’s environmental problems can all be explained by this. </p>
<p class="teisho">Until now we have only been interested and demanding on behalf of our own happiness and pleasure; since we were only chasing after our own narrow satisfaction we’ve contaminated the planet, changed the temperature balance to make it too warm; contaminating the planet continually we’ve brought about all varieties of problems in the environment, leaving problems everywhere around us. Yet the Buddha, when he was practicing his ascetic way under the tree, battled those same temptations, that ego which would attempt to control him, and in doing that he forged a Path for us to be able to know how humans can and should live going beyond all dualism. Experiencing Nirvana he threw off all the tangled desires of lust, greed, love, hate, reaching that place of brilliant light, the place full of the joy of the Dharma.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this way he saw through it all. We might need to ask here, if this doesn’t exist, then what is the true center, the true master? This truth—this living energy, that which is actually alive—what is it? We want to know what it is—it is that which existed before the narrow ego of a small self came forth. This is merely given the borrowed or temporary name of “mu” or “ku.” This is how it is explained, that most Clear mind, that clear Pure mind prior to ego—that totally purified awareness. </p>
<p class="teisho">For example, we have Muso Daishi, the founder of Myoshinji–Sogenji’s headquarter temple. After he was enlightened he spent eight years in the isolated countryside of Ibuka, hidden away from public attention, taking care of the daily tasks and doing errands for the village people in this rural area. During the day he would work in the rice fields and at night he would do zazen with energetic efforts. When this zen master’s teacher died, he had left last words that Muso Daishi would, of course, follow carefully. </p>
<p class="teisho">The emperor at this time, Emperor Hanazono, was looking for Muso Daishi to become the emperor’s own teacher. This same Muso Daishi, also known as Kanzan Egen Zenji, was called by the emperor to Kyoto three times, and each time he turned him down. Finally, when he was told that it had been his master’s final orders that he should teach the emperor, he obeyed his teacher’s orders and prepared to go to Kyoto. </p>
<p class="teisho">The people of the village were astounded—this man who was now to become the teacher of the emperor—they’d been using him to run their errands! They were terribly embarrassed and ashamed. Finally the day of parting arrived—they went to send him off—and no matter how far along the way they went with him, they just couldn’t bear to part and say good-bye. </p>
<p class="teisho">The elderly couple with whom he had been the closest said: “If we had known we had such a wise person with us, we would have asked for your teaching. We are an old couple and we can’t understand anything difficult, but isn’t there something which you could teach to even us? We would like to hear some of your excellent teachings which you might be able to share with even us old people.” </p>
<p class="teisho">On hearing this Egen-san said: “Of course! Fine! Just come over here and stick your heads out!” Thinking he was going to teach them some wonderful teaching, they both stuck their heads forward, waiting for this precious teaching that they were expecting. </p>
<p class="teisho">Egen grabbed the hair on the back of their heads, pulled it up, and pushed their foreheads against one another. When he did this they both cried out “Ouch, ouch! Ouch!! Why did you do this?” </p>
<p class="teisho">“That’s it! That’s it! That’s it! That’s my teaching for you! Just now you said `ouch!’ but not because I told you I was about to hit your heads together leading you to expect something. Did you even once think about it? That `ouch!’ came forth without a single thought, without any expectations at all—did you think ‘this is going to hurt!’ or did you expect it even the slightest bit? That ‘ouch!’—where did you learn to feel that? </p>
<p class="teisho">“You didn’t learn that anywhere, did you? You didn’t learn it from someone else and you didn’t expect it to happen either. You said it just now without even thinking about it. From your mind free from thoughts and prior expectations that `ouch!’ just popped out!  This is the true and actual Dharma. </p>
<p class="teisho">“We all have in our deepest mind the most pure, most purified place. We might forget this clear place in our mind! When we see the world around us, in every single moment we must directly encounter it from this place. In our minds, if we fill them with plans and expectations and then harden them into a stuck lump of old experiences and encrusted knowledge, we’ll be trapped into living with having to have everything pass through that place. You must not live that kind of pitiful life! Right now! This mind which is always being born right now—learn to live in this mind always. This is the Dharma.” </p>
<p class="teisho">This is how Muso Daishi taught the elderly couple.</p>
<p class="teisho">We must actually see the flower from this pure, clear place. We must hear the bird’s song from that clear and empty place; the words that we express from that clear and empty place are the words of truth. These are not words that have been carefully calculated and then spoken—words like that are always lies, as are all words that have been designed. Our life’s true substance, our actual truth, is very quiet, has no expectations, and since it has no expectations it is serene. It doesn’t think about this and that; it isn’t confused and deluded, but instead is serene and settled. From this quiet place, that Pure mind which comes forth, this is the actual clear, True Mind which we should know as precious and natural. Living in this mind is what it means to truly live, to be truly alive. This is the Buddha’s Dharma teaching. </p>
<p class="teisho">We must always be in this serene mind. Free from the production of any excuses, we must hold with care that very most pure and Clear mind and know it as what is most valuable. Doing zazen we let go of our ego-attachment and separate from it. We must just once go beyond our ego and become one with the heavens and earth. This very quiet mind must be experienced, and we must taste this flavor thoroughly. The Buddha realized this state of Mind, and his teaching was from his wonder and joy. </p>
<p class="teisho">We carry around so many past experiences with us in our daily lives—all of them are techniques for living. We do need some techniques for living our daily life, but to be alive, to be that life energy itself, requires no technique whatsoever—only a purified and Clear mind. Everything we do is manifested from this Clear mind. This is how the Dharma is taught to us. In his deep realization the Buddha experienced his face before his parents were born. After we are born there is so much externally learnt knowledge, information and conditioning that is stuck onto that mind. Before any of that is added on, we already are endowed with that most Pure mind. </p>
<p class="teisho">In order to express this, the Buddha taught the three varieties of learning of the truth. The first is the person of practice who only hears about the truth; the second who learns about the truth by practicing and understanding the twelve links of causation; and the third who is able to meet a teacher and is guided in his practice. Nevertheless those various teachings are not that Mind itself; they are still the fingers pointing at the moon, tools for our enlightenment. The purer our mind becomes, the less we need these tools—we have to forget about all of them completely, this is how it is taught. Forgetting it all, there is then the most wonderful and pure state of mind. The Buddha was telling us to experience that pure place; to realize and awaken to that place is what he was teaching us.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Six</p>
<h4 id="sutra-19">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">5. Initially, under the bodhi tree you forcefully subjugated <span class="Italic">Māra</span>,  <br/>Attaining extinction, like sweet dew, and achieving enlightenment.  <br/>Without any intention in mind and without experiencing any process,  <br/>You thoroughly vanquished the heterodox paths.</p>
<p class="teisho">A poem praising the Buddha’s superior qualities is given and continued here. The young men are listening. First is taught that there is no one special, no one who is most advanced, no one who is low level in the teachings of the Buddha. If we see this, we clearly see this equality as the absolute law. He explains how everything in existence moves and changes in accordance with the laws of cause and effect. We are not able to make it happen differently. There is nothing absolute except that energy; that is what changes things as they go continually through flux. If good causes are there, then good influences occur. If bad causes are there, then bad influences occur. Nothing escapes this law and this way of things working. This is how the Buddha teaches.</p>
<p class="teisho">And when he meets the philosophers, they tell him about their way of the teaching of non-thinking. At that time the Buddha taught—and he was not a philosopher himself—that if there was a not thinking of not thinking, who was it that was doing that? The hermits who were philosophers had no answer. He asked them, “Where is this, or is there any ego which is not thinking about not thinking?” The hermits could not answer him.</p>
<p class="teisho">It is fine if there is actually only nothing, nothing at all. But in fact, this world evolves, there is progress, it improves. And that happens because we want to improve and change things. We have motivation and passion to see this happen. So then where is this ego? The hermits could not answer. If there is no ego, then why would there be a need to negate one? If there is an ego, then it divides things into two, and that division cannot be denied, because without dualistic thinking we also won’t be able to improve.</p>
<p class="teisho">For the Buddha this was still a question. He was in the middle of seeing what he had to see. This is about the ego. He most wanted to know about where it came from in the first place, and for this reason he decided to go off by himself and resolve that question with his own experience, challenging those human qualities of having desires, of having greed, of having complaints—to extinguish all of that and align and clarify the problem of their being an ego or not. For this he killed and killed and killed and killed and killed and killed himself.</p>
<p class="teisho">Seeing people going off for training, it’s often put, “Go! Die completely!” Or, as Mumon Ekai says, “With every single one of the 360 smallest joints, the 84,000 hair pores, to pour this doubt into our body and being with everything we have; from the top of our heads to the bottoms of our feet, to cut with the sword of that Mu!” To kill everything! In all the twenty-four hours of the day to let go of every last bit of any thought, conditioned idea, education, pattern. And in the doing of that continually, all the time, relentlessly, then we can know this place where there’s no difference between an inside and an outside, this place where there is nothing nihilistic nor is there any having a something. To cut all of that away completely! To do this to the place where we are so thoroughly giving everything to it that we cannot even question! It is like a red hot iron ball that has been in our mouth and we can’t swallow it and we can’t spit it out. Mumon Ekai teaches us in this way. This is the direct approach.</p>
<p class="teisho">This is not about how to calm our mind. This is about a mind which we acknowledge as being like a bunch of wild animals, a gang of thieves, a poisonous serpent. And these three—these desires, this greediness, this complaining—they won’t let us be peaceful. Our whole society has to become clarified in this way. We have to purify all of these various ways of what they call the “mental poisons” so that everyone can realize this Clear mind.</p>
<p class="teisho">What the hermits were teaching about not thinking was perhaps a part of the process. But our strong desire to live has to be acknowledged and given its work to do. The Buddha gave these instructions—to continue always to kill and kill and kill and to die completely. We have to cut away this small self’s state of mind totally and finally, and then from that place let go of all of our attachments. This is why Shido Munan Zenji said,</p>
<p class="teisho">To die, and die completely!  And only then is what we do, good.</p>
<p class="teisho">To kill and kill and kill ourselves totally, until we don’t even know what is alive there any more. People get scared, and they halt and hesitate at this point. How can we live a life if there’s no one there alive to live it?—so wondering how they can be free and do this completely.</p>
<p class="teisho">We have to let go of that ego-attachment. And this is where the teaching of cause and effect comes in. We have to cut that greed. We have to cut that anger. We have to cut that delusion. We have so many self-indulgent thoughts from these three mental poisons that we doubt and suspect each other. We can only come forth from an egoistic place when we’re in that state of mind. When the sun comes out we are not given just one-sixth billionth of a bit of sunshine. We all receive the heat of the whole sun. Everyone has to be able to receive this in the same non-dualistic way.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-20">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">6. With three turnings of the wheel of the Dharma in the chiliocosm,  <br/>The wheel is fundamentally always pure.  </p>
<p class="teisho">As Mumon Ekai has said, we have to continue with our deep clarification until we can let go of everything. In all the twenty-four hours of the day, we continue! We continue until there is no longer any sense of there being an inside or an outside, and our experience is like that of a mute person—of a person who can’t speak, trying to tell their dream. Only they can understand it for themselves. We continue and we develop this until we can know the place where we are deeply aware. And from this experience we come to know, suddenly the earth is trembling and the sky is shaking. At that moment it is as if we are walking hand in hand and seeing eye to eye—seeing with the same eyes as the Buddha and the Patriarchs. We can go into the middle of the city and play in everything we do, in that joyful samadhi. And with this deep experience, the Buddha realized that place of no self and no other, finally and completely. So, from there comes forth the question where is there anything to liberate? Nor are there any longer any desires to be pursued.</p>
<p class="teisho">In society, control is not considered a bad thing. But we have to let go of it all in our training. We have to leave that control behind. If we don’t move through that place, there can be no amazed wonder. And when we can, we can let go of all of it. That leaves only this great law of the heavens and earth. And that is not a concept. A concept is the greatest obstacle. As it says, we have to kill the mother, we have to kill the father, kill the kings; this is the concept of father—which means that we have to kill that one single, attached, mind-moment completely, that darkest ignorance. </p>
<p class="teisho">The mother is the desire for love, that by giving birth we end up loving and longing to be loved. And when we are attached from the core in that way, it becomes an obstruction. This is accompanied by two other ideas to which we have to cut our attachment thoroughly. One of those is the idea that when we die we continue eternally. The other is the idea that when we die there is nothing after that at all. These are both concepts, and concepts obstruct, mentally and dualistically. They have to be let go of. And then our state of mind can shine forth brilliantly.</p>
<p class="teisho">Our genetic makeup, our past experiences, and the kind of mind material we find and think about—to not be caught on those things. But to realize this place, where as it says in the Heart Sutra, “without form there can be no emptiness; without emptiness there can be no form.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Our senses are not limited. We also cannot paste our memories into an album and think there is some importance in those. Things of the past have to be let go of.  We have to let go of those and be instead always in this very precious moment—at this moment which is always clear, always new, always alive and always fresh. Or else we are betraying the truth in each moment. We have to be able to let go of everything in order for the law to work there.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-21">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">6. ... The achievement of enlightenment by gods and humans attests to this,  <br/>And the Three Jewels are thus manifest in the world.</p>
<p class="teisho">When the Buddha had his deep experience he could only think that no one else alive could possibly understand what he had just understood except maybe the hermits, and they were already dead by that time. And so it is said in the writings that a god from the heavens came down and implored him to please share what he had just learned, and guide others. In response to this request he went back into deep samadhi and he sat longer. He came out and had realized that the place to go next was to see and teach his very advanced friends, friends of training when he had been at Dantoku-san. They were very glad to see him.</p>
<p class="teisho">It could not be only a matter of him having fallen incidentally into deep meditation. When he came down from that mountain of Dantoku, he was given some milk and some healthy food by Sujata near the Nirzen River, and then he sat at Bodhgaya and finally was able to break through, sitting under the Bodhi tree. But his friends who had been joining him before that in deep ascetic training thought that he had strayed from the Path in doing it this way, and that is why they had separated. But they were still very happy to see him.  He taught them first, about the Four Noble Truths—this Path of realizing suffering and that self and gathering were what caused this suffering, that grasping causes this suffering, and that the truth of impermanence and the path to liberation is realized by right understanding.</p>
<p class="teisho">We suffer because we gather. We accumulate, and then we get attached to what we accumulate. We suffer psychologically. And so we have to let go of it all. We practice in order to do that by following the Eightfold Path. To his five friends he gave this teaching, and they were all immediately enlightened.</p>
<p class="teisho">At Kushinagara, under the sala tree when the Buddha was dying, he asked his disciples if they had any doubts or questions. But everyone was so deeply in sorrow that they could hardly speak until finally one said, “Master, no matter what, we will live in accordance with the Eightfold Path when you are gone.” The Buddha told them to be silent, that he would now enter deep nirvana.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha himself: how was it possible that he could really awaken without anyone to tell him how to do that, any person who had gone before him? It was possible because he had realized and exhausted the laws of cause and effect.</p>
<p class="teisho">In becoming we are liable to the laws of great ignorance. And realizing this, we have to be able to break through everything to go beyond it. To be able to see that if we were coming forth in any mind-moment from nothing at all, then we would be coming from a clear place. But if what we were coming forth from in any given mind-moment was a personal karmic darkness, then that is the Great Darkness that has to be clarified and brought to light.</p>
<p class="teisho">We are not yet clear and clarified. A baby appears simple and innocent, yet it is not free from its karmic affiliations. Although it appears clear, it is not a clear place that it has developed; it’s simply not yet affected by others. Like a dog or a cat, it does not consider its own behavior yet. So here is where the Buddha Dharma comes in. We have to clarify and purify with the Mu, for example; we have to be able to cut through everything. We have to be able to take that Mu and, keeping it going all the time, all the time—all the time looking right at what <span class="Italic">is</span> it that walks? What <span class="Italic">is</span> it that sleeps? What <span class="Italic">is</span> it that works?</p>
<p class="teisho">It is not the Mu that says it is in pain and misery—that is the ego. We dig into that Mu and we continue and continue and continue until we lose track of our attached thinking and we realize directly that clear, bright Mind which is then revealed. In zazen—in the Path of zazen—this comes forth from understanding the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Cause and Effect.</p>
<p class="teisho">And finally, the third turning of the Wheel, the Dharma, is that we are not doing this for our own small, limited self, but we are doing it for the liberation of all beings. And for this we have the teaching of the Way of the Bodhisattva. In order for this to be realized we have to forget everything and give all of our life to others in the way of the Six Paramitas, which are teaching us how to do that with Charity followed by Disciplined Behavior, Great Patience, Strong Efforts, Deep Samadhi, and Clear Wisdom. And in this way the Buddha brought this teaching of the Dharma Wheel three times into society. Right in the middle of that world of desires and differences and prejudice—he realized that even in the middle of all that we are equal and we are One. This is the Wheel of Dharma that was turned three times.</p>
<p class="teisho">Three times this Wheel was turned. The Dharma Wheel shows us a way to realize our clear nature, not to bind us to something called “Dharma.” The Buddha taught these ways of training, but this is still only a finger which points at the moon, it is not the truth itself. The moon is the truth.  Just as our ego is not something for our own satisfaction, but for liberating all people in society, so the purpose of Dharma is to lead us to the truth, not to be hung onto after that. Dharma is not the truth itself, but a tile with which to knock at the gate. It is the same for susokkan. We repeat it and align our breath by using it until we are clear and stable enough not to do that. It is not to limit and bind us that we have Dharma.</p>
<p class="teisho">If we can see that clearly, then we will have no conflicts. It teaches us but does not bind us. Once we realize it we don’t need it anymore. An example would be like that of raising a young dog. We first have to keep an unruly young dog on a leash so that it doesn’t go into the neighbors’ homes and bother other people. Then when it gets trained and a little older we can take the leash off and it won’t have that same behavior. We can’t stop our training until we can humbly follow through; it is not about getting a school diploma saying “Now you are finished.” This has to be clear. The Dharma is to bring us to freedom, not to bind us.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Seven</p>
<p class="teisho">As the Buddha says, our True nature with its Pure mind sees all things and people as pure. The various paths of those who enter— the path of the Four Noble Truths, the path of experiencing the Twelve Links of Cause and Effect, the path of the bodhisattvas, observing the bodhisattva vows and practicing the Six Paramitas—all of these ways of entering are the Dharma path. But when this path is realized, then there is no more need for carrying around a Dharma. It becomes a leftover caught place which also needs letting go of.</p>
<p class="teisho">People of the Path are originally healthy. They choose sickness and being treated as part of how they walk their path. They meet a doctor of mind (a teacher), who can see clearly just how things really are and give a prescription for medicine which is eventually healing. But after we take that medicine, we put it into action and we recover, we no longer need the medicine—unless we are addicted to the medicine, which is not a healthy state. This is also like the raft which takes us to the other shore. We leave this shore, which is the side of the river where there is hate and conflict; we use this raft of teaching to get to the other shore which is wisdom. We need this boat, this raft, to get to the other side. But once we are there, having crossed over the water, if we were still carrying the raft on our shoulders while walking around on land, how stupid that would be! To use this Dharma but not become addicted to it and keep carrying it around. As Shotoku Daishi said, “All people, all countries, all teachings have to be clarified”—and then we are pure. It is purity of nature and it is extreme peace, and thereby the Three Jewels were revealed.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha was awakened under the bodhi tree, but this is not some special thing, some extreme experience to realize what is already there—the way of the heavens and earth, that the external world is zero and empty, always in flux, mere phenomena, appearing to exist but only transient with no actual, lasting substance. We have happy times, we have angry times, we have furious times, we have sad times. We change in a second, sometimes! This is our usual world. Inside we are one and the same—this is the way the universe is, this is how it’s constructed. The Buddha was the first one to awaken to this truth and to teach it. If we betray and go against this we just get confused. This law of the heavens and earth and of all humans—it is to this that the Buddha awakened.</p>
<p class="teisho">Yet we cannot diminish the importance of the Buddha, who realized this and became totally free and then taught. The two hermits he’d learned from before he was awakened were no longer there and so he first went to liberate the five people with whom he had practiced. </p>
<p class="teisho">In that era when the Buddha was awakened, there was a very selfish son of a wealthy man. His name was Yasha. Yasha was continuously seeking only his own pleasures and desires, exhaustively and in any way he wanted to. He went all the way to the end with this, beyond what most people are able to do, and when he had nothing else he found exciting or wanted to try, he became very melancholy. He had used up all of his pleasures and desires so totally that he felt like dying. As he was wandering through the woods of Ikurodaga he ran into the Buddha, who was sitting, meditating in the woods. The Buddha saw Yasha walk by and read his state of mind by his appearance, and he called to him and talked to him. He taught him of the infinite joys and pleasures within and how this was different from those joys and pleasures that were external, those which would end and make us melancholy. Hearing this, Yasha was deeply awakened and he became a disciple of the Buddha.</p>
<p class="teisho">Yasha’s father, a rich man of the area, was looking desperately for his suicidal son. Walking through the same woods he came upon the Buddha and next to him, his son who was now in robes and with a great bright face. He saw how he had returned from his wish to die and he saw that only this person could possibly have saved his son with his teaching. And he called him—this person who had saved his son—an Awakened One, a Buddha. It was here for the first time that the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha were born. So the Buddha is not someone who is an absolute, but one who has realized the deepest truth—not a golden statue to be worshipped, but that Clear mind which is in each and every person’s heart.</p>
<p class="teisho">Everyone wants to be fortunate and so many religions advertise promises of good fortune. Also, to be poor and sick is terrible, and so religious promises are also made around harmonious households, good health, and good fortune. But no matter how happy and healthy we are or what a materially flourishing household we might have, we still have to die. No one can live forever just because they have a lot of money. In our mind if we are shallow in our desires and desperately search for good fortune or money, then we may appear satisfied for awhile, but it will not last. To liberate us from that state of mind of grabbing, to liberate us from that state of mind of defining a line between self and other, we have to realize that place where there is no more division between self and other. If in our mind we are caught, then more and more we can’t live luxuriously. But we can live in a simple way and realize great energy. And with that, to wash our state of mind and live that clarified way knowing just what is sufficient—living moderately, knowing what is enough. Even if we make a lot of money it will eventually disappear. But if we realize this clear state of mind we are always serene. This is the mysterious Dharma in our mind. And if we can realize this place, we can know infinite clarity.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-22">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">7. With this wondrous Dharma you save sentient beings,  <br/>Who after experiencing it never regress from permanent serenity.  <br/>As the Great Medicine King who saves us from old age, illness, and death,  <br/>You should be worshiped as a Dharma sea whose virtues are boundless.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha taught that this world is infinitely in flux, constantly transforming. This huge universe is one Life energy of infinite time, manifesting each moment’s phenomena and making use creatively of each moment’s phenomena. While we are alive we continually get older and will eventually get old and will eventually die. People get old, they get sick, they die. We hear more and more of how many of our friends have died; we get a little scared. </p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha said our Life energy is in our deepest focus in each moment, in each breath. Our true life is in each breath, each moment— born and dying, born and dying, born and dying, born and dying. To be sick is just one more phenomenon. And our great suffering of having worked long years—this is like a medal, an award we’ve won for getting old. If we casually lived forever and there was no marking, no punctuation such as death, we would never realize the value of being alive. We make efforts in every moment to be able to realize our True nature, and we find out that our truest base is the Dharma sea—the whole universe! In each instant our mind radiates—and from here we know deepest wisdom.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-23">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">8. Immovable before abuse and praise, like [Mount] Sumeru,  <br/>You are equally compassionate to those who are good or not.  </p>
<p class="teisho">Here this poem is continuing the exaltation of the Buddha. The Buddha nature is clarified. We hate to be insulted and criticized, and we love to be praised and honored. We are so light and easy to be moved around. With this true base realized, however, we are not moved around by such things. Knowing our true way of being, we continually work at being full and taut. Like the blowing up of a balloon, each breath—every breath—we put our entire concentration into our tanden. We feel that full tautness within our belly. It comes forth from within, not by forcing with power from outside but naturally coming forth. We are praised but we are not moved around. Or if we are insulted we’re not bothered by it, like a parent whose child insults them and tells them they’re so horrible and the parent says, “Yes, yes, I know”—this kind of huge, all-embracing state of mind!</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha was so often insulted, especially by parents whose sons had become his disciples. He was extremely insulted by many, but he was not moved around by it at all. For example, when a man would come in and be very angry at him, the Buddha would answer by saying, “Do you ever have guests come over to your house?” The man would say, “Of course I have guests come over to my house!” And the Buddha continued, “If they come around noontime do you fix them a good meal? Do you give them something to eat?” And the man would say, “Well, of course, if they come at that time I would give them some food.” The Buddha continued, “If you prepare this food, make this feast for them and they come and their stomach is full and they can’t eat and they refuse, they tell you they can’t eat, then whose meal is it? Is it your meal or is it their meal?” The man would say, “Well, of course, it’s, um, my meal.” So the Buddha said, “Well, my stomach is full. So please take your meal and go home with it.” He wasn’t saying it in a way that put the person down or bashed them; he was teaching them something in his equanimous response.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-24">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">8. ... Your mental processes are universally same, like space—  <br/>Who could hear of the Jewel Among Humans without becoming devoted [to you]?</p>
<p class="teisho">“In all the Three Worlds, in all the Three Realms, everywhere is my home. In all the Three Worlds, in all the Three Realms, all the people are my children.” This state of mind of embracing all people has to be taken into consideration. This is not only about the Buddha’s state of mind; our mind also has to be clear, and then there are no more moral or immoral people. All are the same, one and the same. Like a parent who wants very much for their most difficult child to succeed. A child doesn’t usually have a deep sensing of everyone and everything around them, but for adults it is important to see each and every person clearly and as if it was their own child. And even if the child embarrasses them or shames them they still want the child to succeed and do well. This mind of the parent is the mind of the huge, bright blue sky. This is not only for the Buddha but for all of us—not being afraid of another person’s deep, deep problems, fear, and misery, but listening fully with clear openness.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-25">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">9. Now we offer the World-honored One this subtle canopy  <br/>Within which is manifested to us the trimegachiliocosm, <br/>Including the palaces in which the gods and dragons abide,  <br/>As well as the gandharvas and yakṣas.</p>
<p class="SutraVerse">10. We see all that transpires in the world, <br/>He of the Ten Powers compassionately manifests these transformations.  <br/>The congregation has observed this rare event and all exclaimed in praise of the Buddha, <br/>And now we bow our heads to the Honored One of the triple world.</p>
<p class="teisho">Now we are much more united—all countries—than we were at the time that this was written. 6.5 billion people and yet we know each others’ countries and exchange communication much more openly. We meet many kinds of people all the time, and yet we have to see that, even though there are many different kinds of people, we are all one and the same. In this way the Buddha showed them all the happenings in the heavens and earth. This was at a time when this could not be done just by pressing a button as we can do today. He showed them the criminals, the murderers, all the different terrible things that were happening. In the time of the Buddha, everyone seeing all this would have been deeply astounded, and to this great Master they all prostrated.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-26">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">11. [You,] the Great Sage and Dharma King, are the refuge of the congregation, <br/>Who purify their minds in contemplating [you,] the Buddha, all of them in ecstasy. <br/>They each see the World-honored One in front of himself,  <br/>Through the [eighteen] exclusive attributes of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.</p>
<p class="teisho">This great Mind was seen—and not because of some miraculous powers, but from his mind of seeing all people from all countries from all times. As Shinran Shonin has said, “All people in all eras are my father and are my mother.” All people who have been children over the past 3.5 billion years—we have all become parents and children and parents and children over and over again. And so we know we have been the parent and the child for all people. Someone once looked at this mathematically, as it is exponentially increasing by generation. Each person here is welcome to calculate this for yourself, to please see this deep connection, this ongoing, continuing connection.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-27">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">12. The Buddha explains the Dharma with one sound,  <br/>And sentient beings each attain understanding according to their capacity.  <br/>Each one says the World-honored One is speaking his own language,  <br/>Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.</p>
<p class="teisho">If we go deeply within, we encounter the Buddha. The Buddha in front of us is doing zazen—to encounter that Buddha! To not bother in counting our wispy, unreliable thoughts. Instead, to meet the Buddha. To not continue to entertain those extraneous thoughts. To see deeply within and find what is there when we become totally one with each and every moment right in front of us!</p>
<h4 id="sutra-28">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">13. The Buddha preaches the Dharma with one sound,  <br/>And sentient beings each understand accordingly.  <br/>Everyone accepts and practices it, and receives its benefit,  <br/>Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha’s words bring meaning to all who hear it; in each and every word there is deep meaning to be found, each word is alive. It’s like a poem of old:</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">If we clap our hands, all the fish gather, <br/>Thinking there’s some kind of food coming.</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">If we clap our hands, all the birds fly away. <br/>And if we clap our hands, the tea shop master comes out,</p>
<p class="TeishoVerse">Thinking there is some customer who wants service.</p>
<p class="teisho">With just this one clap of the hands, all of these things begin moving around, alive, and the action happens. It is in this way also that when the Buddha spoke from his clear place it would put many things in action.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-29">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">14. The Buddha preaches the Dharma with one sound,  <br/>But some are afraid and some joyous.  <br/>Some generate revulsion [to the world of suffering] or eliminate their doubts,  <br/>Through the exclusive attribute of [the Buddha’s] numinous power.</p>
<p class="teisho">From the leader’s act of speaking in a single voice, some merely develop an instinct for the teaching, some gain realization, some find pacification of all their doubts—this is a special quality of the Buddha. The Buddha would teach in very simple, direct phrases that would touch each person in a different way. For example, to say, “All is empty,” a greedy person hears this and becomes terribly melancholy, thinking how sad it is that here he wants all these things and that after all they’re empty. One who is unlucky in whatever they do, for whom nothing comes out right no matter how they try it might think, “Well that’s all right! If all is empty after all, it must be just so hard for everyone! There’s no need to be so upset about it!” A very ambitious person would hear these words, “All is empty,” and know that even if he has great prosperity and has gathered great wealth he will have to eventually die and see that all of this is empty. It gives him a chill. He sees that he must help others and do something differently. Each person hears this one simple sentence directly put by the Buddha and feels it in a very different way. This is the very mysterious teaching.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha’s eyes are clear and bright, overflowing with compassion but still clear and transparent. Just as his eyes are clear, his mind is clear as well. After spending many years doing zazen—deepening in the serenity of samadhi—this samadhi is revealed throughout all of his being. This doesn’t happen from the creative and inventive efforts we just put in yesterday or this morning. Over a long period of time these efforts were kept going. The body, the mind, the words that are coming forth—all of them are clear and bright. The teaching of the Buddha is always serene; with great joy he guides us on our Way. This serenity is a very important part of the Buddha’s teaching; today we often see groups of young people gathered, or even religious gatherings as well, and these gatherings are noisy and boisterous. If it is quiet, people won’t gather, they say. Saying this, they try to make things look attractive and colorful, but although perhaps that may be what will make the people satisfied, it is not something that develops the Mind. Because young people have no clear center within, they become insecurely active, needing to always be on the move—active and busy without being settled. By making all kinds of noise they keep themselves fascinated and intoxicated. This has no meaning whatsoever for the deepening and developing of the Mind. It is a mistake to lead the mind into an unsettled state. To harmonize and bring it to a place of peace is what needs to be worked toward.</p>

His teachings reflect his deep essence and wisdom.  Like the lotus, that mind that was in the mud comes forth pure, white—not a bit of stain or dirt on it. Above and beyond this, the Buddha never steps off the Path of his devoted training, freely and fully teaching the truth everywhere and to everyone. We respect this great functioning from our deepest hearts.</p>

<p class="Poem">From near and far the bodhisattvas have gathered in the zendo  </p>
<p class="Poem">Beginning the training retreat, even the forest extends its welcome. </p>
<p class="Poem">The great silence of Vimalakirti—a diamond sword!</p>
<p class="Poem">Our courage unmatched, our hearts firm as iron.</p>
<p class="P3">Day One</p>
<p class="teisho">In the Vimalakirti Sutra, the first chapter is on the Buddha lands. In the city of Vaisali the Kosaka bodhisattva had 500 friends who, with their very fancy parasols decorated with jewels, welcomed the Buddha. Buddha gathered them all—these parasols—and suddenly the whole universe was under one umbrella. The Buddha himself did not perform miracles in this world to clarify our truth. Instead, each person’s Buddha nature—seeing beyond differences, seeing the unified Clear mind in all—for this the parasols were offered.</p>
<p class="teisho">All 500 bodhisattvas present then asked the Buddha to teach them. Their Clear mind had been clarified and was seen to be not dualistic but to be at one with the whole universe—and not through an egoistic view of what “One” is, an idea of an “I” who is at oneness. When there is no separate self which is being centered around, the whole world becomes who we are, and just as it is. This was the first realization that the Buddha was clarifying, and thanks to that we are able to see the Mind as the truth, having seen it was not something separated. This world seems so full of problems and confusion, yet if we let go of our self center as an ego, then we see it all as our own existence. Suffering people, deluded people, are all who I am. So this is why we have to ask, “How can we build a true Buddha land with everyone?”</p>
<h4 id="sutra-31">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">11. When the elder’s son Jewel Accumulation finished speaking this verse, he addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, these five hundred elders’ sons have all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi (complete, perfect enlightenment). We wish to hear of the purity of the countries of the Buddha. Would the World-honored One please explain for the bodhisattvas the practices by which a land is purified?”</p>
<p class="teisho">We are beings who have to eat or we get hungry, sleep or we can’t last.  In what way can this dualistic “I” see through these problems, and how can everyone become huge, spacious, round-minded people? This is what we hope for, but when will this ever be possible? We can’t know the answer to that yet.</p>
<p class="teisho">When our ego is less demanding, then we can be lived through by our deeper wisdom no matter what the situation is. There are people in the world who have to eat meals which cost hundreds of dollars every day; this takes huge economic resources. But if we can be grateful for whatever food there is, no matter what small amount it is, then we don’t have to make so much money to supply ourselves with food. And if we all do whatever we feel like doing—with food, with air, with resources—it will only cause further conflict. Rather, look for how we can all live together with what we have. Because of the conflicts in the world today we have so many vulnerable people who are being hurt. Our worlds are so full of ego and desires that it just keeps increasing, making the conflicts worse and worse. To be one who can share what they have, whatever that is, and share their Path, however far along it they’ve walked—this will help a little. This is what the Buddha is teaching. Here, the young bodhisattvas have asked him to teach them.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-32">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">The Buddha said, “Excellent, Jewel Accumulation! You are able to inquire on behalf of the bodhisattvas regarding the practices by which the <span class="Italic">Tathāgata</span> purified his land. Listen clearly, listen clearly, and consider this well. I will explain it for you.” At this, Jewel Accumulation and the five hundred elders’ sons listened as instructed.</p>
<p class="teisho">Upon this request the Buddha gave his approval to the young Latvakara. ‘Good, young man! Your question to the Tathagata about the purification of the Buddha field is indeed good. Therefore, young man, listen well and remember. I will explain to you the purification of the Buddha field of the bodhisattvas. The Buddha then said to the bodhisattvas gathered there, ‘How should the world be, to be peaceful?’</p>
<h4 id="sutra-33">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">12. The Buddha said, “Jewel Accumulation, the categories of sentient beings are the bodhisattvas’ buddha lands. Why is this? Bodhisattvas acquire the buddha lands according to the sentient beings they convert. They acquire the buddha lands according to the sentient beings they discipline. They acquire the buddha lands according to what country sentient beings need to enter into buddha wisdom. They acquire the buddha lands according to what country sentient beings need to generate the roots [for becoming] bodhisattvas.</p>
<p class="teisho">This world of limited food, limited water, limited resources—how do we work with this? Awakened bodhisattvas with their deep wisdom realized will resolve these problems. So, how should we be in the world?</p>
<h4 id="sutra-34">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">13. “Jewel Accumulation, you should understand that sincerity is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva attains buddhahood, it is sentient beings who do not flatter [and lie] that come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">The teacher for this question’s answer is in society. This is not about setting up some ideal and trying to make it happen. First we have to look deeply at the society. How should we do this? This is for each person to awaken to, each person awakening to the fact that they are responsible for creating this world.</p>
<p class="teisho">How can each person awaken to that, to create a new, awakened world? We all have to embrace the state of mind of the bodhisattva, to vow to guide others to deep awakening even before we ourselves are completely awakened. Before building material Buddha lands we need deep, radical change within. For example, if we plan to construct a building, first we make the ground very firm and prepare it well, then it is easy to build. If we try to build in thin air, to build in the sky, that is very difficult. In the same way, we cannot force an ideal on people in society. We have to look at the source of the problems first: Why are we suffering? We have to look at that straight on, or else it is like building a building in mid-air.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-35">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“A profound mind is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva attains buddhahood, it is sentient beings who are complete in merit that come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="sutra">“The mind of bodhi (bodhicitta, i.e., the intention to achieve perfect enlightenment) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings of the Mahayana come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">At this the Buddha said, “To firm this ground, how do we do that? Not building haphazardly, but building with a firm base.” You have to look at this. “The Clear mind as it is, is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” This is one of the most famous phrases from this sutra of Vimalakirti. “The Clear mind as it is—this is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.”  </p>
<p class="teisho">So many people do various demonstrations in this world, but how many of those who are demonstrating in different movements also look inside and review their own behavior and make changes within? If your own mind is swirling around in whirlpools of confusion and darkness, that can only make more problems in the world. Yet if there is one truly peaceful person, that person will affect all others that contact them. And this is true, vice versa. If we make an enemy out of everyone who does not agree with us, that will not resolve anything. We have to go first within; we have to review our own behavior and our own way of being inwardly. We become peaceful and that peace will ripple out and touch everyone else. “The Clear mind, as it is, is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” If all of our minds are clear and straight, are not twisted—that is the Pure Land. Because we don’t even know our own minds we are in confusion. We are all born with this Mind that knows beyond conflict. Only if we realize that truth directly can we possibly correct anything. It is not someone who flatters or exaggerates to people; this will not create a true place, it has to be someone who is simple and plain and honest.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-36">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The mind of bodhi (bodhicitta, i.e., the intention to achieve perfect enlightenment) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings of the Mahayana come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">As the Buddha has said, “The Clear mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.” So how is this done in this world where there are those who are inhuman? There are those with self-conscious awareness and those without. There are all kinds of plants and minerals, and humans have so readily assumed them all to be for humans’ use and humans’ convenience, as if for humans to live we can do whatever we want to with anything that exists on the planet. And because of this attitude, we do anything we want with all other existences. To see that we have done this, and to see that this is not appropriate behavior—this is the deep, profound Mind. This profound Mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p class="teisho"> Because of humans’ desires we have exhausted resources, and we have caused other beings to become extinct on this planet. We use, we dig, we take away. If we realize our profound Mind, then this is not how we act. It is because our profound Mind is not well clarified that this occurs. To be able to see from this profound Mind is to see with the truly seeing eye of satori.</p>
<p class="teisho">The mind of the bodhisattva—this Pure Land of the Bodhisattva, this deep Mind of the bodhisattva-mahasattva, makes the vow to offer one’s whole life to liberating those in society. Just to bring forth this state of mind of wanting to make that vow, not even yet realizing it—that is the deep Mind which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. When we give rise to this vow, even if not yet realizing it, then people with the same vow from all over the place will come and gather.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-37">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Charity (dāna) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—all sentient beings capable of renunciation come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">The mind of charity is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. This is the first of the Six Paramitas—of charity, of following the precepts, of patience, of making great efforts, of meditation, of wisdom. Even if we have nothing material to offer as charity we can still offer kind words, a generous heart, smiling eyes—things we don’t need money for or material things to offer, but which touch deeply. There are so many volunteers and people in the helping field in this world, but when they are still involved in their own benefit or profit or how much they’re getting appreciated or approved of, that is not true giving. That is not true charity. To have that interaction where all three parts of it are empty—where the person who is giving is not known, where the person who is being given to is not known, and where what is being given is not known. We cannot be caught on any results of this. We see that everything that we do is transient, but nevertheless, we work so hard, not even aware that we’re working, with no sense of having done anything. Truly clear and fresh no matter what we’re doing, this brings great joy; doing it with joy comes naturally. This functioning is also the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. People who can be joyful at throwing themselves away completely will then gather.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-38">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Morality (śīla, lit., “maintaining the precepts”) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have fulfilled their vows to practice the path of the ten types of good come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">Living the Precepts is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. If offering something externally, materially or not materially, as in the first of the Paramitas, charity—this is to offer our inner alignment. We live the precepts. To be able to go within and align, and when we are aligned within, we can live fearlessly. Only when we can live fearlessly can we take away others’ fears. We get up early, we eat meals in an aligned way, we live according to rules—living by rules that are an aligned lifestyle— we learn to naturally live in a harmonious way. And then if we can become that life in a kind of second-nature way we can learn to become free from the unskillful behavior of our body, our mouth and our mind. The unskillful behaviors of our body are that we can be violent, that we can kill, and that we steal. The unskillful behaviors of our speech are that we flatter, that we are hypocritical, that we lie, and that we say different things to different people or say things that aren’t really being felt in our heart. The unskillful behaviors of our mind are that we are greedy, that we indulge in anger, and that we are ignorant. If we can realize the precepts and live in a way that we are harmoniously aligned, then people who have wide open and expansive, round minds will gather wherever we are.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this way the Buddha taught how in that clarified Mind we find the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. He continues teaching what that clarified Mind is—that clarified Mind which is the Mind which brings forth the Vow of the Bodhisattva, that clarified Mind which offers everything, that clarified Mind which lives in the way of the Precepts. One after another he teaches this essence in great detail.</p>
<p class="teisho">We cannot stay egoistic or the world stays confused. But if we align within, then everything around us comes into alignment. If we don’t live this, then it will stay conceptual. And if we stay conceptual, then no true Buddha land can be constructed.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Two</p>
<p class="teisho">For the construction of the Buddha lands—the world which is truly peaceful—the Buddha teaches the most important points for constructing this. Each person has to first, be direct in mind. Realizing that clarity and purity of Original mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. Then people have to also realize the deep, profound Mind—that Mind that sees all things as Buddha nature. People have to have the conception of the spirit of enlightenment; this is the Bodhisattva Mind. There’s the Direct mind, the Profound Mind, and the Bodhisattva Mind, and these three—all of these are the mind of zero, that Mind which is purified and clarified and free from any taint of ego. </p>
<p class="teisho">As Rinzai Zenji has put it, “The clean, pure light in a single moment of our mind.” This is not a Buddha which is far away, some place in the sky, but that very Mind within each of us with which everyone has been born. The Direct mind is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. The deep, Profound Mind—when we are living in that mind all day long, seeing the stars blinking and the moon radiantly shining, the whole universe is holding up everything! There is nothing without purpose and value, and everything is connected in Oneness. This whole universe is the Buddha land as it is—a world beyond any kind of discrimination or ego-attachment. This is the deep, Profound Mind which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattvas. And the Mind of the Bodhisattva sees this world so full of suffering people and gives everything to awaken all beings to that Way of the Bodhisattva. These are the three that are most important.</p>
<p class="teisho">For living in the way of the Direct mind and the Profound Mind and the Mind of the Bodhisattva, it cannot be done by merely being conceptual. And so we have the Six Paramitas, which give us the actual details of how to live in these three states of mind. The Six Paramitas are, first, the way of charity— to live our daily life in offering everything, material and non material, to the people who are suffering in society, to guide all beings to liberation. The second Paramita is following the precepts—to align ourselves within. The first Paramita is to offer everything externally to all people in society, to all beings; the second is to offer our own alignment, to going within and being clear and purified within. The third is that of tolerance, or patience. The fourth is that of great efforts or hard work, the fifth, of deep samadhi, and the sixth, of profound wisdom.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-39">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Forbearance (kṣānti) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have ornamented themselves with the thirty-two marks [of a buddha] come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">This matter of tolerance is the most difficult—to be tolerant, to be patient. In Japan the word for “patience” is written with the character for “mind” over which is written the character for “sword.” This facet of patience is very difficult-to-realize. In the sutras it says that no matter what ascetic practice or difficult challenges we go through, there is nothing as valuable or difficult as patience or tolerance. When we do zazen our body hurts, our thoughts are chaotic, confused and demanding. People so often ask, Why do we have to endure this? The sword over the mind!</p>
<p class="teisho">The person who is be not moved around in any situation, receiving everything as it is, is written about in the sutras. No matter what in the world appears, to have no mental notions occurring about it. The best example of that is a baby—a baby who is fearless, accepts everything exactly as it is, without conditions. If everyone became like this then all conflicts would instantly end.</p>
<p class="teisho">People will say, how can we live that way, though—so weak and unprotected? But look at when we die. Can we really stop it and say, “Wait! I’m really not quite ready to go yet”? No matter what power, weapons or money we may have, we can’t stop death from coming. We all have to die; we can only unconditionally accept it. This is the ultimate point of religion—its deepest substance.</p>
<p class="teisho">But even if we can’t become it and know this kind of tolerance and patience to this depth, we can at least not get furious at every little thing. To review our behavior and repent, look into how we can change it—to apologize—to endure, to tolerate, because none of us is perfect, either. We are not perfected beings. We are all, also, ignorant beings, so we have to be able to be humble, to ask for others’ forgiveness. Some people say that life is a factory for building a face. Some say that Tolstoy had many masterpieces in what he wrote, but that his greatest masterpiece was his face. Overcoming challenge after challenge, one who is no longer moved around by anything—not getting red OR blue in the face when some small problem comes along, the mind not being moved around at all—this is tolerance.</p>
<p class="teisho">There are many practices for that in the sutras. If one realizes this mind, as it is said here, “When he attains enlightenment, living beings with the transcendences of tolerance, discipline and the superior trance, hence beautiful with the 32 auspicious signs, will be born in his Buddha-field.” The 32 auspicious signs—this is the description of the Buddha and how his quality was. That great roundness and dependability—this is what is most important. And then people of that sort will gather. This is what the Buddha has taught.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-40">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Exertion (vīrya) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have energetically cultivated all the [types of] merit come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">In the Yuikyo Sutra [The Bequeathed Teachings Sutra]—the sutra that was given last by the Buddha before he died. In the sutra he taught meticulously about the way of practice, like a mother chewing food for her baby—he teaches that people of training should train in a way which is talked about as looking at a single raindrop. The power of a single raindrop seems so insignificant; and yet, if we have the raindrops to bring down from the eaves, and in the same place a raindrop falls down on a rock, over and over again for years, eventually that raindrop will carve a groove in the rock that it falls upon. This is true in many cases. When we continue over a long period of time then even with what seems like the least significant efforts, there is a remarkable possibility fulfilled. This is what is meant by virtuous application. There are things that can’t be accomplished without this kind of application of energy. We may live for 80 or more years in our lifetime, but there are some things that may not be completed during that time.</p>
<p class="teisho">But how many millions of years have humans lived here on this planet? One person’s life is so brief, but that whole flow is our Life energy. It is not about a single outcome being quickly accomplished. Buddhism with its expansive vocabulary is very nonchalant about expressing the hugeness of this way of looking at things. When it comes to discovering the kalpa, for example, the explanation in Buddhism of what a kalpa is, is this: It is as if we had a boulder that is 50 cubic meters in size—there is this boulder, this huge boulder. Once every 500 years a heavenly being comes down; she is wearing a koromo which is made out of feathers, and her feather koromo has sleeves that are diaphanous, like the wings of a cicada. They are so fine, so transparent. And as she comes down to dance around this boulder once every 500 years, the tips of her sleeves touch this boulder. A kalpa is the amount of time it takes to wear away that boulder with those tips of the diaphanous sleeves of that feathered koromo touching it once every 500 years. Buddhism casually uses vocabulary like this.</p>
<p class="teisho">We may think, Where is this all going to end? When is this going to end? But if one has done the koan of the root source of Mu or the true, everyday state of mind of Mu, we know this One Mind which is beyond any kind of obstruction, beyond space and beyond time.</p>
<p class="teisho">With our whole body and being we dive into giving everything we can to it in the hugest, sharpest way, giving everything we have. And if we can do this, then we can see how this works. And if we cannot, then our clarity of Buddha nature becomes very far away and vague.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-41">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Meditation (dhyāna) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who control their minds and keep them undisturbed come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">This is the fifth of the Six Paramitas. Hakuin Zenji says in his Song of Zazen, “As for the Mahayana practice of zazen, there are no words to praise it fully. The Six Paramitas, such as giving, maintaining the Precepts and various other good deeds like invoking the Buddha’s name, repentance and spiritual training all finally return to the practice of zazen.” The Sixth Patriarch has also said it—that the greatest of all our entrances is that of samadhi—to give no additional ideas of good or bad to anything that we perceive externally and within, to not stay stuck on anything that we are looking at. If we allow our mind to become disorderly we cannot accomplish anything.</p>
<p class="teisho">In doing high quality work we have to clear out everything to focus.  Only then are our best capabilities manifested. For people playing sports, they focus and they forget their body completely. Or for a musician playing the piano, she forgets her hands, even when she’s playing—these are examples of that kind of samadhi. But if our zazen is done only when we are in the zendo and then as soon as we go to do something else we forget all about it, we will consistently be divided between two worlds—that which is the world of sitting and that which is the world of not sitting. </p>
<p class="teisho">In the four postures of the day, whether we’re walking or standing or sitting or lying down, all of these have many possible mind states. We have to become able to not entertain any extraneous thoughts or to entertain our own personal view no matter what we’re doing—whether or not we are on the cushion.</p>
<p class="teisho">There are also many who think zazen is some kind of intoxication. But this is not the case. It is accepting all, accepting everything we see, everything that comes, and not stopping and not getting our mind caught on any of those things that come along but to be always moving along, not getting stagnant, staying with the flow. This is not about being fuzzy, intoxicated, and unfocused, but to be sharply at one with each thing that we encounter and then let it go to become the next thing. This is why Hakuin Zenji has said, “The Six Paramitas, such as giving, maintaining the Precepts and various other good deeds like invoking the Buddha’s name, repentance and spiritual training all finally return to the practice of zazen.”</p>
<p class="teisho">When we are making offerings, that which is doing the giving is empty, that which is receiving the offering is empty, and that which is being given is also empty. This is the same when we are chanting the Buddha’s name.  In every one of these cases, to do it in such a way that we forget ourselves completely and there is no extraneous clutter that is obstructing our purity and flow of mind.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-42">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Wisdom (prajñā) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have achieved] correct concentration come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">This is not superficial wisdom or knowledge, but that wisdom which comes forth from being in deep samadhi. Like a mirror, samadhi and wisdom are the same. What comes to a mirror, a mirror reflects, whether it’s a person or a high mountain. A mirror can reflect because it is empty, like the state of mind of samadhi. If we hold onto any self or self-reflection, then we mar the clear reflecting of the mirror. Because a mirror is empty of anything it can reflect perfectly whatever comes in front of it. Because a mirror has none of its own face it can reflect whatever comes, perfectly. But if we cannot be clear and reflect perfectly, that is because we are stuck on our own personal ways of seeing, thinking this world is wrong, for example. This is a source always of great mistrust—we think the problem is that the world is mistaken and that’s why we can’t trust anything. But this just increases conflict. If we don’t see clearly, then we misunderstand everything. Without aligning this misunderstanding we can become a source of conflict. What I think is good in the world, this person thinks is bad and inconvenient. What he thinks is good in the world, I think is bad and inconvenient. As long as this kind of thinking is going up and down and all over the place then is no true peace possible.</p>
<p class="teisho">There is only Direct mind, which is the Pure Land of the Bodhisattva. In the Engako Sutra [The Sutra of Perfect Awakening] it’s written that wisdom reflects perfectly what comes from every single direction. And only samadhi can do this. For realizing this we have zazen.</p>
<p class="teisho">But even if we sit in the form of zazen, if we don’t let go of everything and realize samadhi—throwing away everything, everything that we have piled up—that doesn’t cut it. It is not about being clever and saying smart-sounding answers, but about being huge and accepting of everything that comes along. This is why it is said in the Lotus Sutra that it is of great value to be in a quiet place and develop that state of mind which is not moved around by all kinds of things—and then we can know that Clear mind that is tall, firm, stable and sturdy, like Mt. Sumeru. Then we can know how, if we are in this place of wisdom:</p>
<h4 id="sutra-43">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Wisdom (prajñā) is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have achieved] correct concentration come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">If we collect this state of mind and we know this place where we are clear, then we will not get caught on whatever comes along. We are always burning up the energy in our mind, like a light bulb burning in broad daylight, because we’re thinking so many things when we could just be letting them go and be empty of all of that distraction. The point is to not hold on to anything in our mind whatsoever. This is the true state of mind of zazen.</p>
<p class="teisho">When we sit on the cushion, though, we have to sit in such a way that we are being surged through by a full tautness that spills into the whole universe, and from there become not moved around by anything at all. Our eyes, our ears—all of our perceptions become transparent. We are able to extend throughout all of the ten directions this state of mind which is coming from this deep samadhi, which is wisdom. People who value true wisdom will gather around those who have realized this state.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this way the Buddha tells about the Buddha land and how to create a world of true peace. Today people are all doing whatever they can for one system or some bit of material progress, but peace is making no headway. Here it is pointing out how a great, radical revolution has to occur within each person’s mind, and not look for some kind of a huge change in something outside of us. We have to have this radical change within. And for the doing of that we have this teaching about this Direct mind, this Profound Mind, this Mind of the Bodhisattva, the ways of the Paramitas—of having great charity and offering everything, of following the precepts, of knowing this way of tolerance and patience, that hard work of meditation and samadhi, and of that deepest wisdom—and further ways of doing this that are yet to be brought up. Today we have looked at these three deep Minds and the Six Paramitas. To bring this truly radical revolution in each person’s mind into possibility! If we wait for others to do it or for something to happen that makes it work, we will never see it happen. We have to be able to do this from within, and it is doing this and how to do it which the Buddha is teaching here.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Three</p>
<h4 id="sutra-44">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The four unlimited states of mind (i.e., the brāhma-vihāras, the four immeasurables) are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have developed sympathy, compassion, joy, and equanimity come to be born in his pure land.</p>
<p class="teisho">The Buddha has first taught of the three great Minds—the Direct mind, the Profound Mind, and the Bodhisattva Mind—and the way to give life to these Minds. He has taught of the Six Paramitas. Next are the Four Immeasurables. A bodhisattva is one who is not moved around by anything in any situation—in every situation they function infinitely with the Four Immeasurables, with this immense Mind of the Dharma living through them.</p>
<p class="teisho">The first of those are the two components of the word “compassionate,” which is made up of two parts, two characters. One is the character for “to give love” and the second character is “to take away”—take away pain, take away insecurity. It’s like the sun—the sun which has both light and warmth. These cannot be separated; they come simultaneously. When the sunlight comes out, the location of everything becomes clear. When it is dark nothing can be seen and distinguished. But with light everyone can again function, knowing where everything is. In this way the sun lights the world and brings warmth to the world. This warmth is wisdom. As the sun rises higher and higher in the sky, then the hard ice melts, and as the ice melts then the living things can come back to vigorous life. The warmth, the light—these cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="teisho">The bodhisattva gives this wisdom to all people, and with this wisdom takes away their fear. With this light, with this warmth, people are brought joy. And with that joy the bodhisattva also is joyful. Like a parent with a sick child, when the child gets better, the parent is also joyful. For this the bodhisattva throws away everything, material and otherwise, and dives into society with this infinite functioning which extends everywhere—not just for one or two certain people but for everyone. That mind of throwing away everything—this is the Way of the Buddha.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-45">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The four means of attraction are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who have been attracted through his emancipation come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">Next we are told how to bring this Mind to all people, how to bring them to realize their True Mind. First of the four ways is the practice of charity—the same as was mentioned in the first of the Six Paramitas. Then there is that way of using and expressing in words kindness and clarity. And the third way is to be able to be on the same level with everyone else—what they are doing, to join in in the same way. And then there is the way of supporting people in material ways, such as offering tea and candy when meeting; even if the central issue is that of Mind, to support that with material things will be of benefit. Charity is to offer wisdom, to offer material things (which we read about in the Six Paramitas). But this offering, the person who is making the offering and the person who is receiving the offering, must all be empty. There is no sense of the one who is giving, no sense of the one who is receiving, no sense of something being given.</p>
<p class="teisho">But even if we offer wisdom, it cannot be done in the way of saying, “You must understand it like this.” Rather, we have to see what a person really needs and then, when we know what they need most, to offer it in the way that it can be received.</p>
<p class="teisho">Second is to speak with kind words that a person can hear easily. This is the high quality of a culture’s expression. We always have to polish and polish and polish the way we use words. In the koans, we have the first type of koan which embraces the whole universe—the greatest wisdom of the whole universe. The second type concerns how that wisdom then functions in various situations. And the third type is on the subtle use of words—how we can use words in a way that truly expresses what we have realized and can function in that way. This is the Patriarchs’ infinite wisdom that becomes second nature. People have to be joyful when hearing these words, when receiving these words, and then these words then bring hope and encouragement.</p>
<p class="teisho">Next, to bring benefit to people. For example, when people gather together for practise, then offer some food and drink, some refreshment. Of course, people are gathering to deepen in Mind, but at the same time, for the harmony of the group, to bring this simple benefit. </p>
<p class="teisho">In kanji the character for “harmony” is the one for “food” and next to it is the kanji for “mouth.” When people gather, then serve tea and candy even though the topic of the event is not related to that—to make sure that everyone is benefiting in coming to this gathering.</p>
<p class="teisho">Finally, to do these things right alongside everyone else—that we are equal. With everyone who is practicing, we join with them in the same place, in the same way, in the same clothing, joining in in a way that brings everyone into equality.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-46">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Skillful means are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings whose skillful means are without hindrance regarding all the the dharmas come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">Next comes skill in liberative techniques. We cannot use these without wisdom or we’ll be used by them. To know what is right and necessary for each person, to be able to see what it is that each person needs—not to be indiscriminately going about saying how we think things should be for people but to be able to see clearly what each person needs. We cannot be looking at these things as moral or ethical techniques, or else we might start thinking that everything that is being done is some kind of liberative technique. For a volunteer who works so hard to care for someone, it could also be considered a liberative technique, but we have to see what is for which reason. We get confused about what is a liberative technique and what is the Original nature. We have to know and clearly understand what these liberative techniques are; without a deeply clear and awakened Mind the techniques will become confused. </p>
<p class="teisho">We’ve been given those Four Noble Truths—how human beings are in a world of suffering from having a view of themselves as a small self; and that view leads to greater suffering because we’re always gathering things, having things, and accumulating mor things. This suffering is relieved by realizing the truth of impermanence; seeing that these things will not last helps us loosen our grasp on them. And finally, the way to realize this truth is the Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-47">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhisattva’s pure land— when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings who [have accomplished the] foundations of mindfulness, correct exertions, numinous capabilities, faculties, powers, and the noble path come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">Next we have the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment: the four foci of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of magical powers, the five spiritual faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the eight branches of the holy Path. These are many ways to rely on the Clear mind. They are not moralistic and ethical ways to go about judging people, nor are they moralistic tools. When we are praised and honored, we humbly pass it along, holding back on no possible opportunity to liberate all beings and to give everything—to offer our life for doing this. We also have the need to clarify those three unskillful behaviors of body, the four of mouth, and the three of mind. These are all ways to bring people to complete realization—aids and methods for this deep cultivation.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-48">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The attitude of rededication [of merit] is the bodhisattva’s pure land— when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, he attains a country that is complete in all [forms of] merit.</p>
<p class="teisho">Since Hojaku and the other bodhisattvas had asked the Buddha to teach them how to awaken and also how to bring liberative techniques to others, he had answered with these previous lines. And now he continues, teaching that the base of all is to have a Pure mind, an honest mind, a straightforward mind. </p>
<p class="teisho">In any era there are people who, hearing such things, discourage and manipulate us, saying, “Nothing like that really works. You know nothing ever really changes.” They are full of mental ideas that are lacquered on, conditioned, fixed. But no one is born with these fixed ideas. We have to encounter everything and every person with this round, Clear mind to which we have been awakened and bring that same awakening to 6.7 billion people. It is a very rare occasion and hard to come by that we can receive this great opportunity of having a birth as a human being. It has taken 3.5 billion years, this Life energy with which we can live, with which we can realize awakening. To not waste it! To not waste the wisdom of having lived it in this way, or to waste the Path friends with whom we have been blessed, or this air, this water, this precious environment that we have received. To be able to share it, even if it appears to be a loss to ourselves. Not to be caught on anything like loss and gain. Everything—everything has to be seen as equally given to everyone.</p>
<p class="teisho">Neither can we live without the aid and the support of vegetables, of animals, of all kinds of beings. We are protected by all of these beings. To see this profoundly, deeply and directly, and to see how it has been this way through all eras. To realize the wisdom which has been gathered there and align our minds to it, and with that to work in society.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-49">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Explaining how to eliminate the eight difficult realms [where the Buddha and Dharma are unknown] is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, his country is without the three evil destinations and eight difficult realms. </p>
<p class="teisho">The various problems of society have to be seen in this context. Nothing is a single person’s fault. But to align each person’s state of mind so that we can live, each of us, from our own innate wisdom is what’s needed. Without wasting anything, to see all of society as one huge Life, so we can all align ourselves with that functioning which we realize when we are in touch with our true wisdom. And with that wisdom we align society. Everyone—to not run around so busily! Sit down quietly together. We cannot just give charitable material gifts and volunteer work—but to align people’s minds joyfully, together. This is most important of all, and everyone knows this. Then when people become quiet, that very clear place where they are doing that—that inner space also becomes a quiet place, a supportive location. When each person realizes their own wisdom, then no noisy instructions are needed. People can hear what they need to know from their own innate wisdom.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this way the Buddha taught that all is in order, and he finally said,</p>
<h4 id="sutra-50">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“Maintaining one’s own practice of the precepts without reviling the deficiencies of others is the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, his country is without the names (i.e., without even the words) ‘violation’ and ‘prohibition.’</p>
<p class="teisho">In each person’s clear, Direct mind—there is the place of enlightenment. If we know that, and that our Mind is pure, we don’t have to strengthen our many thoughts. We become settled and we can make clear, bright, Buddha lands.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-51">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">“The ten goods are the bodhisattva’s pure land—when the bodhisattva achieves buddhahood, sentient beings whose lifespans are not interrupted, who are very wealthy, who are chaste, whose words are truthful, who always use gentle language, who do not isolate themselves from their subordinates and who are good at resolving disputes, whose words are always beneficial, who are not jealous, who are not prone to anger, and who have correct views— [all these types of sentient beings] come to be born in his country.</p>
<p class="teisho">In the day’s news we only hear of terrible things—things involving great crimes, and great conflict, hardly ever anything good. As the Buddha had taught 2,500 years ago, “We are what we think, having become what we thought. Like the wheels that follow behind the cart, when we have evil thoughts we have evil results. We are what we think, having become what we thought. Like the shadow that follows behind one, when we have joyful thoughts we are followed by joyful things.” We now see how this has truly become the case. We have to seriously receive this as how it is around us and take responsibility for this world which is so cluttered. For us to clarify this is the responsibility of each of us.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-52">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">14. “Thus, Jewel Accumulation, according to his sincerity does the bodhisattva generate his practice. According to his generation of practice does he attain the profound mind. According to his profound mind does he discipline his intention. According to the disciplining of his intention does he practice in conformity with the teaching. According to his practice in conformance to the teaching is he able to rededicate [merit].</p>
<p class="sutra">“According to his rededication does he have skillful means. According to his skillful means does he make sentient beings accomplish [liberation]. According to his accomplishment [of the liberation] of sentient beings is his buddha land pure. According to the purity of the buddha land is his explanation of the Dharma pure. According to the purity of his explanation of the Dharma is his wisdom pure. According to the purity of his wisdom is his mind pure. According to the purity of his mind are all his merits pure. “Therefore, Jewel Accumulation, if a bodhisattva wishes to attain a pure land he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind is his buddha land pure!”</p>
<p class="teisho">We are given this precious chance to do zazen together, but it cannot be only zazen of automatic form or it will only increase our various thoughts ongoingly. As Hakuin Zenji has said, “In this place of our lower abdomen, in the place of the fire in our lower body and in our feet and legs, to bring to that place all of our energy. Our true home is to be found there. In this place of our lower abdomen, of our lower area, of the bottoms of our feet—to bring to that place the building of that world of Amida. In this place where we bring all of our energy together in this hot furnace of our tanden, of our legs, of the bottoms of our feet—in this place, to find this true Dharma body,” This place where there is nothing needs no decorating whatsoever. This cannot be done in a murky way. It has to come from our deepest vow and determination to clarify and purify all things. When we can do this we can bring these Buddha lands into being. If our zazen is truly done deeply and with integrity, then we can actually bring revitalization and new energy to everything.</p>
<p class="P3">Day Four</p>
<h4 id="sutra-53">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">15. At that time Śāriputra was influenced by the Buddha’s numinous charisma to have this thought: “If the bodhisattva’s buddha land is pure according to the purity of the bodhisattva’s mind, then when our World-honored One was a bodhisattva his mind must have been pure. Nevertheless, this buddha land is so impure!”</p>
<p class="teisho">We come now to the final part of this section on the Buddha land construction, teaching how to bring peace and lasting harmony. For this each person has to have a peaceful mind. All people have equal rights even according to the law, yet crimes do not stop. The more laws we make, the more laws are broken by those who look for ways to find loopholes in the newly made laws. Laws cannot resolve people’s fears, people’s insecurities, their pain, their miseries, nor their inner suffering. Rather, it is these painful states of mind that drive people to break the law, to commit crimes, to do violent acts, and desperate behaviors. </p>
<p class="teisho">Those who have money and status and are in charge—people think taking that away will change something. A newborn baby doesn’t think like that. The Buddha saw this and knew clearly that it isn’t laws that will solve the inner dis-ease. Only each person seeing clearly their own mind—this actuality— will solve that.</p>
<p class="teisho">Only if we have purity of mind is this possible. But when we read a newspaper what do we read? We read about bribery, thievery, various crimes, murders—not very pure at all. Shariputra, the top disciple of wisdom, could turn circles around any person, even if they had many doctorate degrees. ‘When the Buddha has such a Pure mind, then why is the Buddha land around him so impure? When the Buddha has appeared in the world, how could it be like this? In this way Shariputra was doubting.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-54">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">The Buddha knew what he was thinking and asked him, “What do you think? Although the blind do not see them, can the sun and moon be anything but pure?”</p>
<p class="sutra">[Śāriputra] answered, “No, World-honored One! This is the fault of the blind, not that of the sun and moon.”</p>
<p class="sutra">[The Buddha said], “Śāriputra, it is through the transgressions of sentient beings that they do not see the purity of the Tathāgata’s (i.e., my) buddha land. This is not the Tathāgata’s fault! Śāriputra, this land of mine is pure, but you do not see it.”</p>
<p class="teisho">“Shariputra, in the same way that a blind person cannot see that light, a person who does not have a Pure mind cannot see a Pure mind because they are not yet awakened.” If we are full of grumbling and complaining we cannot see with the eyes of gratitude and wonder. We have to be able to be pure to see these things. If the mind is full of complaints and suspicions, no matter how beautiful the place you find yourself in, no joy and no gratitude will spring up. If you do not open your mind’s eye, if that mind’s eye is impure and you look at the world through it, the world also looks impure. If we look at the world from a mind that is cluttered, the world looks cluttered. This is natural. If our mind is clear and bright, the world around us becomes a clear and bright place.</p>
<p class="teisho">Near Okayama there is an island where people with Hansen’s Disease [leprosy] used to be isolated. Now there is a bridge, and today people can freely come and go. Earlier it was considered to be an extremely contagious disease; people were sent there by the country, by the national law. As you probably know, the reason is, this sickness is externally visible. Patients’ lips disappear, their eyelids fall off and the ends of their noses crumble. The disease was considered extremely easy to spread around, too. The medicine we have today—bromine—was not yet known about at that time, and people who were discovered to have the disease in Japan were forced against their own wishes to go to this island, sent like criminals thrown into a prison. People who suddenly arrived there would almost always consider suicide; they had to be watched very carefully when they first arrived—like a prisoner being thrown into a solitary prison cell. And for one year, two years, three years, they wouldn’t even be able to see what kind of a place they had come to, where they had been living. </p>
<p class="teisho">When Roshi first went there, there were 1200 people still living there. Now there are only 300 people, almost all elderly people, because the disease is no longer considered to be so dangerous and people aren’t isolated when it’s known they have it. But the people who are there have extreme physical deformities because of having Hansen’s Disease and they do not want to leave and live in the world. They are being allowed to live there for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p class="teisho">In the early days they needed twice as many doctors and nurses to take care of the people there. Young nurses—nurses in their late teens—were told by their parents not to go, their parents were so against the idea.  “Please don’t go to that island; you will never be able to find a husband if they knew you were going there.” They would not be able to find a partner, or they might even get the same disease. But these young nurses, just starting their careers came of their own will and took care of the patients on the island. Doctors who could have had great jobs in the city also came—because they wanted to do this for the people on this island, to take care of them, to wipe the puss, to take away the pain, to change their bandages. These patients, who were always so angry and resentful, saw these doctors and nurses who were healthy. What were they doing there? How could they have come just to take care of them? That they would be there, they were like bodhisattvas! And because the patients saw that these people had gone there to take care of them when they had felt so resentful at a society had thrown them aside and would give them no regard—yet here were these people so kindly and so openly taking care of them—they had to let go of their own resentment, their own anger.</p>
<p class="teisho">In this way, the people who were there felt finally that all people had not looked away from them. The doctors and nurses had come to take care of them; even though it was in many cases such a challenging situation for them, they had willingly come. Even though people in society had pushed the patients aside, these people had come to take care of them. Feeling this, they would be finally, for the first time, able to look up and look around at what a beautiful place this island was. There were dandelions blooming in that sand dune. Over there were cherry blossoms in bud. In another place the violets were coming out. They would write poems.</p>
<p class="teisho">Usually their families would not even write to them because they didn’t want anyone to know that in their family there was someone with such a disease. They wanted no letters coming from that asylum so that no one would know where one of their family members was living.</p>
<p class="teisho">If the mind is clear, the country is clear. If each Pure mind is free from the eye of dualism and prejudice, it will reflect everything—like a clear mirror. The world just as it is, is reflected exactly. If we hold on to prejudice and dualism in our mind, the world will also be seen as full of prejudice and dualism; we will be able to receive and accept some things but not be able to receive and accept others. To let go of our own attachments is that very construction of the awakened world. When we are in our settled mind, we see purely; the flowers, the radish, the carrot—these are all the brilliant light of the Buddha. The awakened world is truly not some external heaven or paradise but is that very awakening to our huge, expansive and all-inclusive mind with which we have been endowed since the beginning. </p>
<h4 id="sutra-55">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">16. At that time Conch Crest Brahmā King said to Śāriputra, “Do not think thus, saying that this buddha land is not pure. Why? I have witnessed the purity of Śākyamuni’s buddha land. It is like the heavenly palace of Īśvara.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Brahma Sikkin was a heavenly god whose hair was shaped like a spiraling cone or conch, and he said, “Shariputra, you say it is an impure world, but I see it as a heavenly abode. You just can’t see it because of your state of mind. The gods all see it as a beautiful place but you see it sullied because that is your mind that is seeing it that way.”</p>
<h4 id="sutra-56">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">Śāriputra said, “As I observe this land, it is hills and hollows, brambles and gravel, and rocks and mountains—all filled with defilements.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Shariputra says, “What use is that, when the world is full of weeds and thorns, threatening cliffs all over the place, garbage and empty cans lining the highways, when the mountains—all of the mountains everywhere—are all a big mess wherever you look?”</p>
<p class="teisho">Brahma Sikkin replied to Shariputra in this way, “The fact that you see such a Buddha-field as this, as if it were so impure, Reverend Shariputra, is a sure sign that there are highs and lows in your mind, and that your positive thought in regard to the Buddha gnosis is not pure, either. </p>
<p class="teisho">“Reverend Shariputra, those whose minds are impartial toward all living beings and whose positive thoughts toward the Buddha gnosis are pure, see this Buddha-field as perfectly pure. In your mind there is prejudice and dualism; that is why you see it that way.”</p>
<p class="teisho"> If you see it with the Buddha wisdom you wouldn’t see it dualistically. There are both equality and discrimination in the world; we have to see them both. There are criminals, there are people with no food. If we lose track of that then we lose our wisdom. It is a world of dualism; we have to see this. But it is not only this. We have to know what to see with this deeply seeing Eye. People who are weaker, people who are in pain—we want to relieve their pain. We give people food who have none. We comfort those in a crisis. We have to see this directly and clearly. But if we are not careful we will think that the work of helping someone is a wonderful thing. This can easily be deceiving, thinking that a person is their sickness, is their misfortune, is their difficult situation, is their homelessness—and not see their True nature which is equal in each person.</p>
<p class="teisho">Their shape and form does appear in a different way, but we can’t get caught on only that appearance. There are many appearances, shapes and forms; this is important. We can’t smoosh them all together with some big bulldozer, getting rid of all the differences. We also can’t miss being able to see the clear nature which is in everything, or we’ll see them as weaker people and miss the whole point of their liberation. They all have exactly the same eye of satori, but this has to be opened. The true, original character is the same. Sickness and misfortune is not the Original nature; these are all only appearances. But the True nature is unchanged.</p>
<p class="teisho">In the Soto Sect a teacher named Kitano-san would go to the jail, to the prison, and he would line up the people who were incarcerated there and he would say to them—he would apologize to them and then would deeply bow and gassho and say, “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry. We are all the same in this way, and yet here you are, having to live here and take this punishment in this place. I’m so very sorry.” He saw them all as the same, no difference. We think we understand this, but it cannot be seen through a mind’s eye which is rational and mental. If our mind is pure, then the Buddha land we seek is pure.</p>
<h4 id="sutra-57">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">Conch Crest Brahmā King said, “Sir, your mind has (i.e., perceives) high and low because you are not relying on buddha wisdom. Hence you perceive this land as impure. Śāriputra, the bodhisattva is universally same [in attitude] regarding all sentient beings. The purity of his profound mind relies on buddha wisdom and therefore is able to perceive the purity of this buddha land.”</p>
<p class="sutra">17. At this the Buddha pointed to the earth with his toe, and instantly the trimegachiliocosm was as if ornamented with a hundred thousand jewels. It was like the Jewel Ornamentation land, with all its immeasurable merits, of Jewel Ornament Buddha.</p>
<p class="sutra">The entire great assembly exclaimed at this unprecedented event, and they all saw themselves sitting on many-jeweled lotus flowers.</p>
<p class="sutra">18. The Buddha told Śāriputra, “You should now observe the purity of this buddha land.”</p>
<p class="sutra">Śāriputra said, “So it is, World-honored One. Originally I did not see it; originally I did not hear it. Now the purity of the Buddha’s country is entirely apparent.”</p>
<p class="sutra">The Buddha said to Śāriputra, “My buddha country is always pure, like this. It is only so as to save inferior persons here that I manifest it as a defiled and impure land. It is like the many-jeweled eating utensils used in common by the gods, the food in which is of different colors depending on their merits. Just so, Śāriputra, if a person’s mind is pure he sees the merits and ornaments of this land.”</p>
<p class="teisho">Next the Buddha says this to Shariputra, “You have to see this well: if this world becomes too easy, people will take it for granted. And if it becomes too pure and clear, then it is also true.” In the olden days there were no such fancy toys for children, who maybe had one stick or one milk bottle. They could play for hours with these simple toys. But when children are given fancy toys, they stop reading, they stop making things up, they stop being creative. They have no more need to be creative.</p>
<p class="teisho">Also, we have to thank the ones who first dug the well from which we now drink. This way of seeing—that there are some simple ways of doing and being—has come from a long, long past. We have to see that we aren’t just doing a job—that if we want to do a job and don’t have the exact perfectly fitting tool, we have to be creative and invent something. We lose our own ability to be creative because we forget the value of working hard. Look at this world! So many are suffering. It is incomplete. This is a very important school for all of our learning.</p>
<p class="teisho">If our mind is quiet, we can see clearly. We don’t need food from a fancy restaurant. We could have fancy, beautiful food from a restaurant, perhaps, but there is the even bigger joy of looking at food we have made ourselves or that someone has cooked for us from their deepest heart. Or sewing something by hand and wearing clothes that are hand-crafted. They may not look as fashionable or fancy, but the warmth and the creativity in them is from our own heart. It has to connect with our deepest heart. To be busy all the time and lose track of this connection to the things we are around and things we do is very sad.</p>
<p class="teisho">Buddha continued with Shariputra, “What is important is to take responsibility for this life we have been lived through by, to make daily efforts which make this life, and share it with all people. This is true purity.” To realize this and see this! </p>
<h4 id="sutra-58">Sutra</h4>
<p class="sutra">19. When the Buddha manifested the purity of this country, the five hundred elders’ sons led by Jewel Accumulation all achieved forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas. Eighty-four thousand people all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p>
<p class="sutra">20. The Buddha then withdrew his numinous powers, and the world returned to its former [appearance].</p>
<p class="sutra">The thirty-two thousand gods and humans who sought the śrāvaka vehicle understood that conditioned dharmas were all entirely impermanent and, distantly transcending sensory defilement, they attained purity of the Dharma eye.</p>
<p class="sutra">Eight thousand bhikṣus [achieved] nonexperiencing of the dharmas, their minds liberated by the elimination of the flaws.</p>
<p class="teisho">Hearing this, all of the bodhisattvas clarified their state of mind and understood this Life energy that was so joyful, that was being manifested at that time. Eighty-four thousand people—all the citizens and people from all around—are all equally endowed. </p>
<p class="teisho">They all saw how this world changes constantly and how our state of mind also changes. Each returns to that place, living with that clarified Eye. To be able to see this, we need to see this humbly.  The Buddha’s 8000 disciples also lost their greed. They became a bright Mind that can be grateful for everything. And with this, the section on the construction of the Buddha lands is completed.</p>
<p class="teisho">We can see clearly from what is written here how if our mind is pure then what we see is pure. This is a great reminder of what is necessary to bring this world to true peace. To be in this huge and open state of mind and with that, to work in the world. To never regret any amount of work it takes for the liberation of all beings.</p>
