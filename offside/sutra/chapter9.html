But wisdom is non-dualistic and beyond all judgment.  Only if we let go of our ego and enter Samadhi can we reflect so clearly.   The thirty some bodhisattvas here are each telling their particular experiences of the non-dualistic. </p><p class="P4">1. At that time Vimalakīrti said to the congregation of bodhisattvas, “Sirs, how does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma gate of nonduality? Each of you explain this as you wish.”</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti said to the bodhisattvas who have entered the non-dualistic, “What kind of awakening have you experienced?  I want you each to tell your own experience of awakening.  I urge you to do so.”  And the first one, Bodhisattva Hojisai begins: “Birth and death are relative.  If we are born, we die.  Because we have one, we have the other.  And therefore they are dualistically related.”  </p><p class="P4">Within the assembly was a bodhisattva named Autonomous Dharma (Dharmavikurvana), who said, “Sirs, generation and extinction (i.e., samsara) constitute a duality. Since the dharmas were fundamentally not generated, now they are without extinction. To attain this [understanding is to achieve] forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Hojizai Bodhisattva then says, “The true Dharma…” The true Dharma, as Master Rinzai puts it, is “to not add on any thoughts to the present moment and not add on any thoughts about the thoughts of the present moment.  If we can not associate to that thought or the thought of the second thought, then it is of more value for our training than a ten year pilgrimage.  The mind’s truth is the Dharma.  As it says in the Heart Sutra, there is nothing extra and nothing missing.  Nothing increasing and nothing decreasing.  Nothing pure and nothing impure in our mind.  Then whatever we encounter would just manifest and leave. But if we put into that mind great attachment and opinions, then we add on judgment from the opinions and attachment, when actually nothing is increasing and nothing is decreasing.  This is perceiving with our ego view. Instead, to let go of that ego view’s perception and to perceive prior to our discriminating, opinionated mind. But this is hard for us to even imagine, we’re so unlikely to be doing it.  </p><p class="P2">But as we sit, it becomes more and more clear what it is like to perceive prior to any discrimination and judging.  Like being in a crowded downtown with hundreds of people walking towards us:  unless we know someone in the crowd, if we don’t know anyone, we don’t even notice their faces.  Hundreds of people, and knowing nothing about any of them, we don’t notice them in particular.   So we can be without differentiation—having no dualistic perception about any of them.  That gives us the clarity to see what it is like prior to this differentiating that we are constantly doing.  But this cannot be known by our usual everyday state of mind which is so permeated with differentiation.  Often we think that judging is the activity of the mind, but this is only a small tiny part of what the mind can do—the mind of a person who is grasping at nothing whatsoever.  </p><p class="P2">And yet, in our daily lives we are always grasping.  If we stop that we can see that that clear mind, prior to any ongoing judging or dualistic perception, is right there.  This is, as Master Rinzai has said, if we don’t add on any first or second notions to what we perceive.  In its time and place it is fine to judge, but we add on thoughts all the time.  Of course, a person who is a professional lawyer or judge has to do that, but we’re doing it constantly.  And from that we get tired and confused.  While those professionals have to do it, we don’t have to wear ourselves out like that if we just think only the necessary things.  Then when that necessary thinking is finished, the thoughts end there.  If we can realize how to do this, then we can let go of those extraneous thoughts that are not necessary.  To let go of those ongoing dregs.  To clarify and purify our mind.  Not to keep adding on extra things.  To do this completely.  </p><p class="P2">When it is our time to die we can think about dying; but most of us are thinking about dying when we are still very much alive.  If we are not caught on this dualistic view, however, we see a truth that is greater than and beyond birth and death, including birth and death but not limited to those two.  Our true experience is to see these but not be holding onto them.</p><p class="P2">Master Bankei said, “Humans’ true nature is like a mirror. When something comes, it shows up in the mirror, and when it goes it disappears from the mirror. Yet, when something comes nothing is born and when it goes nothing in the mirror is gone.” No birth, no death, a mirror mind is like this. It is the pure mind which goes beyond birth and death, a mind of huge love, working beyond any division between self and other. This is satori as they call it in Buddhism and this Self is one with the Buddha, one with God; it is this Self that is eternal.</p><p class="P2">In this way the true dharma is unborn and without death. Since it is like a mirror, our true nature shows whatever comes to it, and when that object goes, it fades. Never increasing, nor dying, from the origin there is not one single thing. This is the true nature, and to directly know this is the dharma. All is embraced; here is one great love in the not-two, and being that love is to live eternally. In this way the first bodhisattva spoke, manifesting his deep enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">Shiki Masaoka was a famous haiku poet. When he was dying he wrote the poem,</p><p class="P3">The gourd flowers bloom<br/>but look—</p><p class="P3">Here lies<br/>a phlegm-stuffed Buddha!</p><p class="P2">It was himself who was dying, yet he looked at that objectively.</p><p class="P3">The gourd flowers bloom<br/>but look—</p><p class="P3">Here lies<br/>a phlegm-stuffed Buddha!</p><p class="P2">The very same person who had written the haiku, that dharma mind beyond birth and death that can look at birth and death and see it as a reflection, this is the state of mind of realization and liberation. We see that self which is influenced by birth and death, but see it from a place that is beyond birth and death. A place that has gone beyond that which is dying and is being seen by that which is seeing that which is dying. This place is not without the deep feeling of seeing death, of pain, of agony, and this place he is also able to see clearly that form of oneself which is dying. He wrote the poem to express it in this other way.</p><p class="P2">There is an actuality, but do not be pinned down by that actuality. We have the circumstances of a physical body but we also are not drowning in the circumstances of the physical body. We are objectively experiencing from our place of wisdom. We see clearly and precisely, and we all have this very high quality state of mind. This is our eternal Self that is beyond birth and death. This has to be seen.</p><p class="P2">Yamaoka Tesshu, on his death bed wrote:</p><p class="P3">Tightening my abdomen<br/>against the pain.</p><p class="P3">The caw of a morning crow.</p><p class="P2">He saw his dying very clearly and directly, this One Person Who Sees. This is the wisdom of one who has awakened to the Dharma.</p><p class="P2">Another poem by Saicho Myokonin,</p><p class="P3">I don’t become the Buddha,</p><p class="P3">The Buddha becomes me.<br/>Namu Amida Butsu</p><p class="P3">My dying has been taken away by Amida Buddha</p><p class="P3">I have forgotten death completely,<br/>And the great joy after this.</p><p class="P3">When I repeat the name of Amida Buddha, </p><p class="P3">I forgot death. </p><p class="P3">I have had death taken away by Amida Buddha.</p><p class="P3">The funeral is over. </p><p class="P3">In the morning when my eyes awaken, <br/>today I am still alive!</p><p class="P3">I received today as well! </p><p class="P3">Every day is a day which I have been given!</p><p class="P2">We are within the world of birth and death yet are not caught in the world of birth and death; instead we have left them behind. The Buddha threw away everything in order to realize this state of mind, which is the eternal state of mind.</p><p class="P4">2. Maintenance of Virtue Bodhisattva said, “The self and the self’s attributes constitute a duality. It is because of the existence of the self that the self’s attributes occur. If the self does not exist, then there are no attributes of self. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">As soon as Hojisai Bodhisattva finishes, then Tokushu Bodhisattva begins, “Because we hold onto having an ego, we develop an ego view.”  For example, because of our body we need to have food, clothing, human communication, relationships, social communication—all our daily needs.  An ego comes into being because we develop concerns and ideas about the needs of the body. Worrying about health concerns, such as the cold weather and our state of health. The ego displays itself through a bodily manifestation, as when we get angry our face becomes red. We have many ways of both exhibiting and examining ourself.  </p><p class="P2">But this ego condition only arises from about 23 months old.  Only from that age do our various personal ideas become firm and durable.  Before that age we never even thought that way.  That isn’t the way we organize our perceptions.  As soon as we bring ego view into it, then we conflict with each other.  But as Tokushu Bodhisattva says, if there is no self, then there is no need for a self view and we can live with body and mind as one becoming only.  </p><p class="P2">If we pay attention to the truth, then we understand how it is prior to that ego view, and we are able to see in a way that is not moved around by that egoistic version of things. However, when we are feeling pain in our teeth, we notice it because our teeth hurt. When we’re feeling pain in our legs, we notice that we have legs because our legs hurt, but health is such that when our body is healthy we don’t notice that we have all these body parts.  </p><p class="P2">It is just like a person who is playing a sport like baseball or people who are doing artwork or playing musical instruments.  They aren’t concerned with their body when they’re playing or  performing.  When playing the piano we forget our hands completely.  We forget the sheet music.  We forget all of the physical things and become that music completely, being right smack in the present moment with it.  We are not concerned with an ego view then.  But if there is a reference to a self, then we will easily get caught on seeing ourselves again as this physical body.</p><p class="P4">3. Unblinking (Animisa) Bodhisattva said, “Experience and nonexperience constitute a duality. If dharmas are not experienced, they cannot be attained (i.e., are imperceptible). Because of unattainability, there is no grasping, no forsaking, no production, and no activity. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next, Fujun Bodhisattva speaks of the pure and unpure, describing it as the words, “not even blinking.”  We blink a lot when we are not in deep Samadhi.  When we are looking uninterruptedly straight at the floor in our zazen, then we are not entertaining a lot of thinking.  Our mind becomes pure.  Alternatively, when our mind is full of thoughts, we are not clear.  </p><p class="P4">As Niso Eka Daishi said when he approached Daruma Daishi, “My mind is unsettled and unclear.  I have no peace.  How can I settle it?”  <br/>To this Daruma Daishi said, “Put your unsettled mind out there and I will make it quiet.”  <br/>But, Niso Eka Daishi said, “I can’t put my mind out there.”  <br/>And Daruma Daishi said, “There, see it’s already done.  It’s already calm and clear.”</p><p class="P2">If you don’t think unnecessary thoughts, it is the entrance into non-duality.  And when we become zazen completely, we are not thinking about yesterday and tomorrow and other unnecessary things.  At other times our head is so full of thoughts that we struggle under a self created heaviness and burden.  While action is zen and sitting is zen, instead we bring in all sorts of unnecessary concerns because we are still unskilled and clumsy at it.  And even though we are sitting, we continuously drag in all kinds of those concerns.  To sit without doing that, to sit and let go of all of those unnecessary concerns.  And then we can know that place of there being no burdens on our mind.  This is what Fujun Bodhisattva is saying.</p><p class="P4">4. Crown of Virtue Bodhisattva said, “Defilement and purity constitute a duality. If one sees the real nature of defilement, then there is no characteristic of purity, and one accords with the extinction of characteristics. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next the bodhisattva brings in that mind of wanting to be empty within, and zazen is to realize this. But because we have so many thoughts, we think we are insufficient, we think that we are unclear.  If every single one of us in society would not be concerned with things we don’t need to be thinking about and carrying around, we could be like that river, which is always flowing freely, holding onto nothing.  And if we make a mistake, we can see the river was not flowing and that is why: because we were caught on something in our mind and not flowing.  </p><p class="P2">This does not mean to not take responsibility for things.  But, like the words are saying, to not  let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.  If the right hand is doing some work of good beneficence, to not have an on-looking self-conscious awareness participating.  And even if we do something good, to not be caught on that.  To not have a self-conscious awareness and judgment of that.  To not pile up thoughts.  To become completely our zazen.  For that we use the breathing practice of sussokan and the koans, to not pile up unnecessary thinking.  Or else we get confused and think that zazen is being done to become a better person or to have a better personality.  If our mind becomes flaccid and dense, it is our biggest problem.  Instead we have to flow naturally, leaving behind extraneous thinking, and then we are in the most pure mind, like the clear stream which is always flowing freely. </p><p class="P4">5. Excellent Constellation Bodhisattva said, “Motion and mindfulness constitute a duality. If there is motionlessness, there is no-mindfulness. If there is no-mindfulness, there is no discrimination. To penetrate this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next Zenshuku Bodhisattva says, “This is the path.  It is one with the mind moment.”  As is it said by Master Rinzai, to not hold onto one single thing.  In that very moment, we are the clean, pure light in a moment of our mind.  Or as Shido Munan Zenji says, to hold onto an idea of a self, always thinking the self has to do this or has to do that and judging it; this is to have a ‘full’ mind moment when actually there is nothing to be holding onto.  To judge either good or bad is to be attached in our mind moments.  </p><p class="P2">Like the sun which does not think about having to rise or having to set.  Like the rain which does not go to where we wish for it to fall.  If we bring up extra thoughts, we get stuck right there.  If we don’t, we don’t get caught on useless discrimination.  If we don’t sully our originally clear mind, if we don’t block our originally free flowing mind, then that is as it is, the path of entrance to the non-dualistic.  Or as the sixth patriarch has put it, in our school we teach of there being no mind moments to be polluted.  This place where there is no “I” and no form.  This place which is always flowing, never fixed in any particular location, this is the most healthy state.  To hold onto nothing at all, all the time, and live in this way of being where there is no form of an idea of a small self to be holding onto.  While working or acting, to not move around blindly: we are then able to see what it is like to be doing these things without unnecessary thinking. </p><p class="P2">Of course, there are some thoughts that are necessary.  Zazen is when, in our mind moments, we have forgotten and let go of everything unnecessary, and this is what Zenshuku Bodhisattva is telling of his experience of the entrance into the non-dualistic.</p><p class="P2">We see by this that our whole life is full of places for us to give life to the Buddha’s wisdom.  It is not something far away.  This is the mind’s healthiest way of being all day long.  And wisdom is to not disturb this.  To hold onto unnecessary dualism is not the way to a healthy state of mind.  Rather, to not think those things we don’t need to be thinking about.  But to see our mistaken ways of doing that and align those mistaken ways. From there we do not create confusion in our daily life, and new wisdom can be born forth.  To live in this way is truly the entrance that is being taught about here.</p><p class="P4">6. Excellent Eye Bodhisattva said, “The single characteristic and the non-characteristic constitute a duality. If one understands that the single characteristic is the non-characteristic, and does not grasp the non-characteristic but enters into universal sameness, this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next is Zengen Bodhisattva, the bodhisattva of the excellent eye.  Each person has their very own character.  Even if we are born as a twin, each one of us has his own face and his own habits.  We are all individual in this way.  There are not two of the same person.  Heights and weights and appearances vary.  Each has a unique body, and the activity of each is particular.  And so each also perceives in a particular way.  Our eyes and ears—these tools are used personally.  And although when we die, we still have physical eyes, they no longer see.  We still have physical ears, but they no longer hear.  Our awareness is not there anymore.  </p><p class="P2">When our eyes do perceive and our ears do hear, what is it that is using them?  As Master Rinzai says, “From the origin there is one great light.  Divided it becomes these six rays”—our six senses.  This is the way that our capabilities arise, and we can use them, all of them.  As an old poem goes:</p><p class="P3">The old cherry tree, that blooms on the ocean of hills.</p><p class="P3">Every year in the same time, these flowers of the spring arrive. </p><p class="P2">So here is this tree, every year it blooms at the same time, but where did these flowers come from?  Where are they until they bloom?  We cut the cherry branch to find out, where are those cherry blossoms before they bloom?  Still we can’t find any source of them.  Yet in the spring, without fail, the flowers always bloom.  It is not a magic trick, but every spring they bloom, without exception.  </p><p class="P2">Myoe no Shonin from Togano was taking a walk and saw the small purple violet at the bottom of the fence  post. He made a gassho to it and his tears spilled from his eyes. His disciple asked him what he was crying to and what he was crying for—what are you praying to? He answered, saying, this deep purple violet–who has put it here to bloom? Who dyed it this beautiful color? Who gave it this exquisite form? Why is it blooming here? There is something in this flower that humans’ knowledge cannot even begin to touch. How can one possibly not pray to this amazing flower?</p><p class="P2">We have all these senses and we use them freely.  Each sense responds in its own particular way.  They manifest each moment’s way of expressing unconfusedly.  This is true in all of our senses. When we hear the umpan, we go to the dining room.  When the bell goes, we go to the hondo.  We do different things according to the sounds.  At every moment, we are experiencing the expressing of that moment perfectly.  Without being caught on our own individual habits, we function.  No matter what situation our senses are performing in, they don’t get confused, and everyone is able to  express and communicate without getting into conflict.  In this way we live empty-mindedly from morning until night, night until morning.  This is what Zengen Bodhisattva is teaching us. </p><p class="P4">7. Wonderful Arm Bodhisattva said, “The aspirations of bodhisattvas and the aspirations of śrāvakas constitute a duality. If one contemplates that the characteristics of mind (i.e., mental aspirations) are empty, like phantasmagorical transformations, there is no aspiration of bodhisattvas and no aspiration of śrāvakas. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next is Myohi Bodhisattva who tells his own experience about the mind of the bodhisattva.  A mind of a bodhisattva vows to let all others awaken first before they do.  This is a bodhisattva:  caring for others  before themselves.  A bodhisattva offers everything to society. In contrast there is the one who hears the teachings and then decides to awaken for himself. He does it for his own personal benefit and awakening, and that’s it. When the Buddha saw the morning star and was deeply, deeply affected, that was a moment where the true karmic affiliation was taking place.  A mind awakening on seeing the morning star;  a tile hitting a piece of bamboo, making a sound that awakens;  hearing a morning bell; encountering a blossoming peach flower.  All of these are different sense experiences that can bring one to awakening.  And this is for all those who practice.  But, if it is a practice that is being done not for offering its fruits for all beings but only for one’s own satisfaction and aligning, that is not the bodhisattva.   We have to vow to liberate all beings until the whole world is liberated.  This is the path of the bodhisattva. But no matter how much we offer to society, we still must continually clarify our mind.  If we get confused, that is when we differ from the Buddha’s state of mind.  And if we carry extra things around in our mind, it causes conflict and it brings confusion.  </p><p class="P2">First we have to give rise to the determination to do our practice for all the beings in society, or our ego and its habits will never be constrained.  To let go of our position, our status, our idea of who we are.  And in doing that we free the mind and know that source we have been from the origin.  With this we are able to walk the way of the bodhisattva.  But while there is a bodhisattva walking in this way, there’s also one who finds out the truth from hearing the teaching, encountering it with deep karmic affiliation to the Buddha.  And with each of these, there has to be a way where everything is given up and all is offered to society or else there can be no entrance to that path of non-duality.</p><p class="P4">8. Puṣya Bodhisattva said, “What is good and what is not good constitute a duality. If one does not generate the good and what is not good, entering into and penetrating the limit of the non-characteristics, this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next is Hosho Bodhisattva, who is talking about the good mind and the bad mind.  We all have ideas about our behavior that sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad.  That conversation is never ending within each of us.  It usually takes place in a moralistic framework, as a human being, as a citizen of a country and of the planet.  We have to align within many challenging situations in order not to bring forth confusion.  And that is why we have these inner dialogues.  </p><p class="P2">Each independent human being must consider these matters, and this is why it is an ongoing conversation.  We are encountering these questions all the time.  And also this is not simple because we have so much other thinking going on as well.  Even though we make efforts, it can so easily stay within a moralistic framework and not come into the clear, sublime truth of our deepest wisdom.  For it to be able to do that we do zazen and enter this huge and all-embracing state of mind.  </p><p class="P2">These are very similar sounding: the moralistic framework and the wide state of mind.  But they are very different.  If we are only in a place which is moralistic, then we can easily get rigid and fixed.  And in the way of the Dhammapada, as the Buddha had said it, “For the person who has won something, they feel bad because they are resented by others for having won something.  For the one who has lost, they are feeling bad because they are resenting the one who has won. But for the person who lets go of any idea of winning or losing, they can sleep easily at night.”  One who lets go of both of these ideas of being resented because they won and resenting somebody because they lost, they are able to be in an abundant state of mind.  </p><p class="P2">To not fall into confusion but to cultivate this hugeness of mind that can include both and go beyond both.  As it says in the koan from the Maka Hannya (Mahaprajna Sutra  Preached by Manjusri–see Entangling Vines, case #24),  it teaches that “The badly behaved Bhikku does not fall into hell.  The well behaved monk does not enter Nirvana.”  Now these are not two particular forms of people of training that are being talked about; rather they are states of mind.  To be confused is to be in hell.  To see that we create this challenge ourselves, that these ideas of hell are self created, we can prevent ourselves from falling into such difficulty and pain.  To see this koan deeply in our mind.  How can we evolve and guide ourselves into this deeper true innate wisdom?</p><p class="P4">9. Lion Bodhisattva said, “Transgression and blessing constitute a duality. If one penetrates the nature of transgression, then it is not different from blessings. Using the vajra wisdom to definitively comprehend this characteristic, and to be neither in bondage nor emancipated, is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Shishi Bodhisattva, the lion bodhisattva, then comes forth and says from his place of strength, “Sin and merit are not two.  It takes many generations to produce merit, and our huge clear state of mind is our greatest merit.”  People ask, why do criminals come into being?  The system is such that there are more and more criminals.  But where does being a criminal come forth from?  Eventually it will be a society full of only criminals.  Instead we have to see how to be a society which does not produce criminals, does not produce them in our minds.  And this is to build merit.  </p><p class="P2">Though sinful behavior and merit seem so opposite, we have to look at the fact that there are no people in the world who are sinning in their minds to begin with.  And what causes this confusion in people that makes them act in a criminal way?  That makes their crimes happen?  To see this we need deep wisdom.</p><p class="P2">In Buddhism, as we read in the sutras before each and every meal, to not do bad, to not do evil, to do good, to clarify our mind.  These are the vows of the bodhisattva.  In other words, this very merit is the basic expression and the way of living of Buddhism. So then why do these crimes happen?  It is because of the ego.  So how do we liberate that attachment to the ego?  We have to work on  that state of mind of not holding onto one single unnecessary thing.  That is what it is to do no evil.  Then from there we will naturally, without any exceptions, spontaneously do good from that place of clarity.  </p><p class="P2">And if we clarify our mind, we could not do evil because seeing directly, we experience each other all as family born in this very same era on the same planet.  So strange that we would be in conflict with each other when our mind is originally, all of our mind is, originally completely clear and sincere, deeply sincere.  If we live in that sincerity of mind, we cannot act in an evil way.  We don’t do bad things from a clear mind because we see all people as members of our family.  We want to help them, not harm them.  And we can see that both sin and merit come forth from the same egoistic unclear mind.  But the evil—they’re like bubbles that foam and froth from that lack of clarity.</p><p class="P2">An old woman once said to Shido Munan Zenji that she was the person with the most suffering in the whole world.  She was in such pain, she was miserable.  She was wretched and she was sure that she had the most horrible life of anybody.  Shido Munan Zenji told her she had to let go of that idea and that state of mind that her life was the most miserable and how miserable she was and how wretched her life was.  If she would let go of all of that, then a clear mind would be right there waiting.  </p><p class="P2">And following her, another woman came in and started talking to Shido Munan  Zenji about how absolutely happy she was.  How everything good always happened to her.  How she was lucky, nothing bad ever happened to her.  Every single day was a happy wonderful day.  And to her, Shido Munan Zenji said she should let go of that idea.  She had to throw that away so that she could learn to be empathetic with suffering people and be compassionate.</p><p class="P2">When we still think that we are so fortunate and so lucky—that will always flip over at some point.  In this way he tells us how to let go of those two and the ideas about merit and evil.  And letting go of that allows us to enter this path of non-duality. </p><p class="P2">In the same way, when Daruma Daishi arrived in China, the first thing that Emperor Wu did was tell him about all of the things that he had accomplished—building temples, raising monks, bringing Buddha sutra translations together—and after giving him this long list of what he had done, he asked Daruma Daishi what merit would there be in that for him,  to which Daruma Daishi answered, “No merit.”  </p><p class="P2">We can see in Daruma Daiishi’s response,  “No merit,” that he was saying to the Emperor to not talk so much about how many good things he had done.  When we talk about how much hard work we’ve done and how much efforts we’ve made, this is not coming from a true, clear mind, and this is not the way that we can realize that place.</p><p class="P4">10. Lion Mind Bodhisattva said, “To have flaws and to be flawless constitute a duality. If one can attain the equivalence of the dharmas, then one will not generate the conception of flaws and flawlessness. Being unattached to characteristics, but also not abiding in the absence of characteristics, is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.” </p><p class="P2">Next we have Shishii Bodhisattva, his name and the expression of his entrance into non duality is similar to the previous bodhisattva, and he is a very courageous bodhisattva.  He is speaking about the  difference between the perception of having no desires and how it is once desire has been thoroughly ended. To realize that state of mind where we will be able to see clearly will bring equanimity.</p><p class="P2">The Zen master Ikkyu said that “we live in a world of many thoughts, and we think because we are alive.  As long as we live, we will be thinking.  If we don’t think, we are no longer alive.”  If we were to ignore a child who is crying, this is not to be a person “without desires”.  And as he said when Vimalakirti was asked why he was sick, he answered he was sick because society is sick.  But when we first have to let go of our own problems—that is very difficult.  That does not mean to put society’s problems out of our mind.  We have to become even more empathetic, like a parent who agonizes along with their child who has problems and is crying in the night.  Even if the mother gets not a wink of sleep all night long, still she stays up with the troubled child the whole night.  Satori is not for producing inhuman people, instead satori is for not being caught on and confused by our own personal attachments. Satori enables us to help suffering people nearby.  </p><p class="P2">Today people seem so full of their own terrible pain.  They even kill those around them who are feeling good.  And the numbers of mass murderers are growing at a startling rate.  So many thoughts come into a mind which is trying to forget its pain.  An immature child is especially vulnerable to this.  To guide and teach them caringly.  To see from the mind that is not dualistically attached to finding one’s own pleasure, but to also work to liberate others’ pain.  How can we liberate others’ suffering?  This is the entrance to non-duality:  where many beings, more and more, need the true guidance and education that is most necessary for this liberation.  </p><p class="P4">11. Pure Emancipation Bodhisattva said, “The constructed and the unconstructed constitute a duality. If one transcends all categories, then the mind is like space. If one’s wisdom is pure and without hindrance, this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">The eleventh is Joge Bodhisattva, pure and free of all calculation and dualism, without any core of dualism, receiving everything just exactly as it is.  He says that ideas of having done this or having done that, thinking of things past or things to come—how much extraneous thinking we pile on because of this.  And all of it is delusion, making us feel that we have understood something.  Fine that we want to help people, but if we are full of ideas of how kind we are whenever we are doing things for others, this is not truest kindness but self-conscious kindness.  And so we have a hard time purifying our mind, always piling up thoughts, and bringing all those thoughts into whatever we do.</p><p class="P2">For example, are we really empty-minded when we reprimand our children?  We know we have to reprimand our child but we look at their face, worried that by telling them something we will twist them later, and so we put it off thinking that we will correct them the next time.  And again later we do the same thing, holding onto it until suddenly we burst into strong anger from having held onto it for so long and not saying it in the first place.  Is that truly empty-minded?  Not when the emotions have already piled up.  Even if we think we should be clear when we are actually not, we will bump again and again into this same pattern.</p><p class="P2">The opposite of this is being like a great, wide, clear, bright, blue sky.  Suddenly, a good idea comes along and we do it right away, spontaneously.  We reprimand our child on the spot for his mistaken behavior.  To let go of that twisted, tangled way of being and be wide open and clear, and say what needs to be said in that very moment.  Then there is no contradiction and nothing left over.  Then this is an entrance into non-duality—a fresh, clear state of mind.  In this way, Joge Bodhisattva is teaching us.</p><p class="P2">Emperor Wu asked Daruma Daishi, “What is the ultimate sacred truth of the Dharma?”  The point in Buddhism to be most thankful and grateful for, the most sacred point, what is that?  To this Daruma Daishi answered, “Nothing holy.  Only emptiness.”  There is nothing to be so thankful for.  Your thoughts are already selling it anyway.  Then Emperor Wu continued, “Aren’t you that living kuanyin who has been promised to come to us?  And shouldn’t we be grateful and thankful for that?”  To this, Daruma Daishi answered, “I don’t know.”  A matter of course, what can we know?  Every instant we change and flow with the flux, so we cannot give a fixed answer for what is always dynamic.  </p><p class="P4">12. Nārāyaṇa Bodhisattva said, “The mundane and supramundane constitute a duality. The emptiness that is the nature of the mundane is the supramundane. Within these to neither enter nor exit, neither overflow nor disperse, is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next, Narain Bodhisattva speaks.  To live in society is very challenging.  The political situation, the economic situation, everything always increasing in price.  Maybe for those at the top of society’s hierarchy it may be okay, but for those just barely making ends meet, they have no money for their children’s college education.  To endure that ongoing pressure of discrimination and difficulty is hard to describe.  Only hoping to be given a better birth next life. </p><p class="P2">In this case, if  a birth had not been given in the first place, that would have been even better.  Always feeling pain, resentment, and grief for something we don’t have.  Our mind sunk in bitterness.  We can only pray for a better birth, perhaps as a monk or a priest is what it would be in this time and era, in that birth the next time around.  </p><p class="P2">In this kind of despair, where people are only able to see that things might be better in the next life—here is where seeds of crime ripen.  At the bottom layers of society’s status system, where there are not even rays of hope.  We feel helpless and unable to even be liberated.  But while the actuality may stay so challenging, we can always bring new wisdom to any situation.  We look deeply at how things are.  We bring in a new way of seeing it and approaching it.  We may think even being born was terrible and resent being alive, and then we come to see that all of this is transient.  </p><p class="P2">There’s an old Japanese song that says if we look up all we see above what we have is “I want this and I wish I could have that and where can I get that”.  Wanting more and more than we have.  We look down and we see only people who are suffering much more than we are, who are much more disadvantaged than we are, and we can only want to help them.  And we begin to feel thankful for the blessings we do have.  </p><p class="P2">Of course, looking at things this way is considering the scenery externally.  We also have to see the wisdom of not falling into deep hopelessness and  irresoluble anger.  People who are wealthy with material things, are they all happy and content?  If we look down at all of the roofs of the houses from a high up mountain top, we can see that under the roof of each and every house there is someone troubled, insecure, full of anxiety— troubled people everywhere.  While having so much, so many things, they worry about thieves coming and taking it away.  But if you have nothing to begin with, there’s nothing to worry about.  Nobody is free from concern of some kind, but just today, to not be worried about anything at all.  In this way, Bodhisattva Narain is teaching.</p><p class="P4">13. Excellent Mind Bodhisattva said, “Samsara and nirvana constitute a duality. If one sees the nature of samsara, there is no samsara. To be without bondage and without emancipation, neither generating nor extinguished— to understand in this way is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Seni Bodhisattva who talks about Nirvana versus an idea of life and death.  Because we fear death we are anxious in our life.  And then that generalizes to anxiety about everything.  Nirvana—the word is written as ashes which have burned up completely, but where there is only a slight bit of warmth left to those ashes.  A very quiet, settled, serene state of mind. Nirvana, as the Buddha put it, is the extinguishing of all hate, all anger, and all ignorance.  This is the serenity of nirvana.  </p><p class="P2">In the world we are always wanting more and more and more and equating getting more and more with being alive.  Our cells call to us to stay alive, to be alive.  With cancer cells, when we have them, all the other cells that want to stay alive are calling out to us to be strong with a great drive.  We feel like we need so much and want so much. We never get enough and are angry when we don’t get more.  </p><p class="P2">When we are able to see clearly and quietly that we do have enough, we are greatly relieved.  Our head calms down from its business and its complex dualism that makes us almost ready to explode sometimes.  In this kind of dualistic dilemma, we easily conflict with others because our edges are so frayed.  Instead we have to develop wisdom and a quiet mind, or we will be continuously agitated. But it can’t be only about a conceptual version of nirvana, forcing ourselves to sit down and sit zazen.  Rather, to dive into everything we do.  In our daily life, becoming every action completely, without separating from it, without bringing in all the extra thinking—to do it with everything we are.  </p><p class="P2">The Buddha himself did zazen at Dantokusan mountain for six years.  But that was for six years of his life. It isn’t that he didn’t sit afterwards, but that after that he did not stay in the same way and place he had been.  He went everywhere and taught anywhere, making the truth which he had realized clear for all people. Not a conceptual zazen, but that zazen of being totally at one with whatever we are doing.  To do things in such a way that we are bringing every moment into total participation and absorption.</p><p class="P2">We are in the world of life and death, yet we go beyond it. To live in a quiet mind about this is to know the mind of the dharma door of non-duality.</p><p class="P1">Dogo and Zengen</p><p class="P2">In the olden days, in the Tang dynasty in China, there lived a Zen master named Master Dogo. One time he was with his successor, the monk Zengen, who was his attendant. For the first time he took him to the home of someone who had died. </p><p class="P3">Zengen looked into the coffin and asked his teacher, Master Dogo,”Is he alive, or is he dead?”</p><p class="P3">Master Dogo answered, “Can’t say he is alive, cannot say he is dead.”</p><p class="P3">The disciple Zengen said, “Why aren’t you clear?”</p><p class="P3">“I don’t say it because I don’t say it.” </p><p class="P2">Dogo kept it right there.</p><p class="P2">This is a very interesting story. Zengen was a superior disciple. When he asked Dogo such a question, of course it is a dead person, but having just died, has that person no longer anything to do with being alive? As long as we are alive, we know we are going to die; our parents die, our friends die, we see things dying all around us, so of course we are aware of this, even if we don’t want to be.</p><p class="P2">If we only think mentally about this, then it comes out as a dead person is a dead person;  but Zengen was thinking of death relative to aliveness. The living person as dying and the idea of dying are what he was comparing by asking, is this person completely dead? This is what he wanted to ask Dogo.</p><p class="P2">But Dogo Zenji would not answer this, “is he alive or is he dead?” If he gives an answer to one or the other of those, he is then carrying around a concept of living and dying. If we have seen this truly we see that only while we are alive are we alive and when we are dead we are dead only.</p><p class="P2">“I can’t say! I can’t say!” There is no mistake about this; he is not being simply moved around, not at all. Instead Dogo is saying the truth about this matter. But Zengen, who was not deluded either, was asking clearly what a living person is; he was wondering about what is absolute death, that which we cannot even think of, he is asking about that.</p><p class="P2">But if the attendant asks,”Is he dead?” then immediately it is divided into duality. The attendant’s place of not being thoroughly realized is seen there, and it hurts one’s mind, because it is caught on life and death.</p><p class="P2">When dying, to die completely; only then can we be a person for all people. When we are alive we are completely alive and when we die we are completely dead. If we only get this with our head it is still dualistic. Alive is absolutely alive, dead is absolutely dead. They cannot be mixed with each other or they become two, but this cannot be known by mentally thinking about it.</p><p class="P2">In the Edo era Shido Munan Zenji left his last words of “While being still alive, to die and die completely, then everything we do is good.” </p><p class="P2">So, is Master Dogo saying that alive is dead? “It cannot be said.” Just while alive to live completely without being confused or adding in ideas about death to it. If we have the time to think about death, then we should become completely dead—this is the truthfulness of the words of Shido Munan Zenji, not to be moved around by either, but to see each directly and clearly.</p><p class="P2">If there is any division, it does not work. Only if we become death completely–not just being full of words about it, not adding on thoughts about it that bring mental ideas into it—but becoming it totally and completely. And to be totally alive, living completely and not adding in thoughts or bringing in mental ideas. We have to see this clearly, otherwise we will be caught on ideas of living and dying even if we are making efforts to train. This is what Seni bodhisattva is talking about. Each and every person has to realize this directly, beyond concepts.</p><p class="P2">Everyone is so afraid of various things, and we are especially afraid of dying. If we just die when that time comes, how simple.  But this is humans’ way of worrying and angrily drowning in our own ideas of how things might go, complaining, and holding on tightly to any available ingredients for delusion.  Instead, to not think our lives into a hell full of extraneous thinking.  Rather, to let go of all of those ideas and see what is clearly in front of us, bringing wisdom to it, the wisdom with which we are innately endowed. In this way, this bodhisattva is speaking.</p><p class="P4">14. Manifest Perception Bodhisattva said, “Exhaustible and inexhaustible constitute a duality. Whether the dharmas are ultimately exhaustible or inexhaustible, they are all [marked by] the characteristic of inexhaustibility. The characteristic of inexhaustibility is emptiness. Emptiness is without the characteristics of exhaustible and inexhaustible. To enter thus is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Genken Bodhisattva who sees clearly what is right there in front of us.  Genken Bodhisattva says there is no end to our suffering and that is why we live the eightfold path given to us by the Buddha: the way of the right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  </p><p class="P2">From the four noble truths we learned that our suffering is caused by constantly wanting more and more.  We do need food.  We do need lodging.  We do need clothes.  But we think we need much more than we do.  So we should let go of that idea by living in accordance with this eightfold path.  We have a body.  We age.  And as we age, we think more and more that we need all kinds of things in order to live.  This is from our deepest ignorance and delusion.  </p><p class="P2">To break through that, to end that, we do zazen and training.  We cultivate merit and we think of different aspects of training to do, but if our deep greediness comes to an end by any of that practicing we might do, are we then happy?  No.  Rather, while having a body, to see clearly that we don’t have to be caught on having and not having.  We realize this from our prajna wisdom.  To be able to access this prajna wisdom, we do zazen.  Even after these three days of osesshin, are we are still full of thinking, still anxious and designing some great plan or concept and getting into its grip?  Instead, to become our zazen completely in every single instant.</p><p class="P2">When we are do our sitting, to become totally that sitting only.  If we are standing, to become that standing totally and completely, to become only that standing.  When we are doing our work, to become that work wholly and completely, only doing that work.  Just as it says in the Heart Sutra, to focus completely on this moment, not trying to be a something, or we again and again end up being upset because of the environment being whatever it is—interrupting us as we’re trying to be a certain way.  Rather, in whatever comes up each moment, to become it totally and completely.  Becoming it completely, whether we are sitting or walking or working.  We have not a moment to look away from that process of becoming each moment completely.  It takes everything but our usual habit of following everything else around everywhere—“Oh, it’s so warm today; oh, it’s so nice outside”—thinking about everything else but this instant and what we are doing.  Meaning to do it wholly and totally and once again pulled away from it.  But not to be pulled away from our focus.  </p><p class="P2">When we are hearing, to hear completely, to become it completely.  When we are seeing to see completely, to become it completely.  With our whole body, with our whole being, we become each moment and each activity of that moment, completely and totally, and not with our head, but becoming our breath in every single instant.  Again, we become that breath and we become that breath and we become that breath.  </p><p class="P2">And here we begin to clarify and to let go of the extraneous things more and more and more.  Or it is only concepts in our head that we are dealing with.  We can’t be walking around with two of ourselves, only one.  With no idea—not an idea of trying to be quiet and not an idea of being quiet that is being watched to see if we are doing it.  If we can let go of that, then we will not be caught on anything.  But becoming each and every moment completely, wholly, and totally: this is the entrance into non-duality.  </p><p class="P4">15. Universal Maintenance Bodhisattva said, “Self and no-self constitute a duality. Since even the self is unattainable, how could no-self be attainable? Those who see the real nature of the self will never again generate duality. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Fushi Bodhisattva (Parigudha) saying that self and selflessness are dualistic.  Everything in the world is in flux.  And there is no such thing as a fixed self, even though we are given a name by which we are called again and again until we start thinking that is who we actually are.  While we are only being called by this name and there is no fixed ego, we still get upset when someone insults the name and happy when someone praises our name.  </p><p class="P2">What is the heaviest thing in the world?  Heavier, even, than the world?  It’s our ego.  And without it we are lighter than a single sheet of paper.  We live in this mysterious way.  </p><p class="P2">As Master Bankei said to those gathered for a Dharma talk, “Nobody came here to this talk in order to hear a dog barking today.  But if a dog barks, you hear it.  Never having expected to hear a dog barking when you came, you do hear it and that is the selfless self.” We are always seeking and gathering input, blind to this ego’s apparent weight,  when actually there is no such thing. There is no ego that is doing the seeing.  There is no ego that is doing the hearing.  There is no ego that is doing the speaking.  There is no ego that is doing the tasting.  There is no ego that is doing the feeling.</p><p class="P2">Only when we are considering, after the fact, what was it that we heard, what was it that we saw, what was it that we tasted: that is when this ego comes into play.   Actually the ego only judges and comments on the data which our senses gather.  It is not the ego which is doing the perceiving.  But what if we throw out that data or if we have a person who isn’t processing data like that? We can’t live in society where everyone is dependent on processing that data.  </p><p class="P2">Without it—as we get older we lose our data—we get treated like we are unburnable garbage and  called senile, “out of it.”  Just because that data which the society considers so essential is off, people are treated without respect—as if their value had decreased because the ego gathered data is not coming out so easily.  Neither should we be treating people who are older as if they are isolated, treating them like an “old person”, special.  </p><p class="P2">Rather, to see that this is what it is, prior to the ego, which is all beings.  This great all-embracing Mind.  It is impossible to measure the height of the Heavens.  Yet the Mind is above the Heavens.  It is impossible to measure the thickness of the Earth.  Yet the Mind is below the Earth.  The sun and the moon shine with a great radiance, yet the Mind is the source of that radiance.  Within the Mind, the four seasons open in their sequence.  Within the Mind the sun and the moon move.  Oh, great Mind.  Swallowing down all existences, all four seasons in their cycling, this is who we all actually are—not some collection and gathering of data that is then interpreted by an ego.  If we truly open our deeply seeing eye, we see that we are beyond life and death.  Oh great all-embracing Mind.  This is what we actually are.  To awaken to this.</p><p class="P4">16. Thunder God Bodhisattva said, “Wisdom and ignorance constitute a duality. The real nature of ignorance is wisdom. Furthermore, wisdom cannot grasp and transcend all the categories [of reality]. To be universally same and nondual with respect to this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Denten Bodhisattva (Vidyuddeva), number sixteen.  He’s teaching about the mysterious path of the not-two.  One who can see like lightening striking is what his name means, who can see everything in one bright flash.  This dark ignorance is the cause of all ideas, all mental moments, birth, sickness, aging, death.  This place of no light or clarity, this denseness.  We are always bringing forth wisps of thoughts that are not necessary for our everyday activities.  </p><p class="P2">The thoughts that are necessary for everyday activities stop when they are no longer needed and leave.  But we live with the habit of having all kinds of thoughts, including unnecessary ones.  You know those thoughts about other people, the past and the future, which are constantly popping up in our minds.  These are not necessary, but just for some reason arise and fill our heads and then make more extraneous thoughts and more extraneous thoughts endlessly.  This is like a rock thrown into the water, spreading ripples across a pond, going back toward the rock and back toward the shore again.  Lots of little waves.  That is just like our unawakened state of mind: thought ripples that are unstoppable.  </p><p class="P2">Actually we can know what is actual if we just don’t get pulled around by blind thinking which has no end and holds our mind tightly.  The ignorant thoughts are without essence or necessity, they simply occur.  As it says in the opening lines of the “Song of Enlightenment” by Yoka Daishi—Have you not seen the idle person of Tao?  Who has nothing to learn and nothing to do.  Who neither discards wandering thoughts nor seeks the truth.  The real nature of ignorance is Buddha nature, the illusory empty body is the Dharma body.  Have you not seen the idle person of Tao?  Who has nothing to learn?  And nothing to do?  The state of mind of holding onto nothing.  Have you seen it?   Be a full and wide open person.  Don’t be caught on endless unnecessary thinking.</p><p class="P2">It seems difficult, but if we know they are empty, we can perhaps let them go.  For example, an idea that we want to taste something delicious comes along, and we move toward it.  First, don’t entertain that thought.  While we are sufficiently covered by clothes or we have a certain amount of money which is plentiful, we always want more clothes, want more money.  We want this.  We want that.  To let go of all of that.  A person focused on their true goal is not like that.  We have to realize that personal goal that we set and work toward it or we end up half-baked.  </p><p class="P2">As the Buddha said, he had liberated everyone he possibly could, and he had left karmic affiliation for all others, meaning he had left his disciples to teach those he had not been able to guide to awakening.  And that was why he left Kasho Sonja and his other disciples.  The Buddha ended his life with that kind of care, having wrapped up everything very, very attentively.  How few can do it like that?  Is there a company’s president who completes every last detail for those who follow him?  </p><p class="P2">Human thoughts are like an instant of frothy bubbles.  No matter what wonderful thoughts we have, they are all useless.  “Who neither discards wandering thoughts nor seeks the truth?”  Everyday we are insecure or we are confident.  Always changing.  And difficult thoughts can crop up.  We are moved around by our own mental froth.  At times we even end up being violent because of them and having to be taken care of by the police.  That froth that comes forth.  But to not count on all of those thoughts.  </p><p class="P2">The real nature of ignorance is Buddha nature.  The illusory empty body is the Dharma body.  We come to find out all of that is Buddha nature as well.  Eventually we are all full of wrinkles on our body and face.  We feel terrible some days.  We feel okay other days.  We feel terrible here, terrible there.  And then we die.  It’s like we’ve been hit by a thief and robbed.  After eating at all those great restaurants and feeding that body, giving it great clothing, everything that we can think of that is nice to wear.  And then what?  That body is taken away from us.  It is a huge theft.  </p><p class="P2">We are one seven-billionth of all humanity.  Seven billion people, and each with trillions of cells.  Always metabolizing and resupplying this planet to feed all of those, that was the Buddha nature, but in fact it was nothing at all.  This shows us that the illusory empty body, that is the Dharma body.  This is spring, let’s go look at those flowers.  And here’s the summer, let’s go swimming over here.  And then the autumn, those colored leaves again.  Everything changing always.  We enjoy these changes, moving here and there, wanting this and that, and disliking some things terribly.  We are like clouds flying past through the sky until we are only skin and bones.  Today, well; tomorrow, feeling bad.  Just a talking kimono.  And we see how this is the mysterious path of the not-two.</p><p class="P4">17. Joyful Vision Bodhisattva said, “Form and the emptiness of form constitute a duality. Form is emptiness—it is not that form extinguishes emptiness but that the nature of form is of itself empty. Likewise are feeling, conception, process, and consciousness. Consciousness and emptiness are two. Consciousness is emptiness—it is not that consciousness extinguishes emptiness but that the nature of consciousness is of itself empty. To [abide] within and penetrate this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next is the Kiken Bodhisattva (Prayadarsana) teaching on things of form that are never changed, that are always changing.  In spring the flowers bloom.  In the summer the green trees fill.  And in the autumn their leaves fall to the ground.  In the winter time, all that has fallen to the ground becomes absorbed into it. Right in front of our eyes this world is in constant change.  And in that change shows its very emptiness.  </p><p class="P2">An empty void world is not a separate world, but this one which is always metabolizing our bodies, always bringing forth new blood circulation, new breath which enters with fresh oxygen for our body, is not stagnant, but always in flux.  Our eyes also, void.  We see best when we are not even conscious of seeing.  The same is true with our ears and our nose.  We hear best when we are not thinking about our ears and how they are doing with their hearing.  We perceive best when we forget our ears and nose.  The same with moving.  We move best when we forget our body completely.  It is not that there is something, a separate something called emptiness.  </p><p class="P2">There is also an empty aspect to our mind.  We have five windows on the world, our senses.  We see a flower, but we don’t only see one flower all day long.  We know it as a flower, so we know what we are seeing. We decide to pick that flower and move to do it at once.  We are not moved to pick that flower all day long, but motivated to do other things as well.  Our actual essence is not stagnant.  </p><p class="P2">That which we try to remember we often can’t remember, but later we can.  So we have put it away somewhere.  Indeed it had been placed and we can find it again, if not always at the moment we need to get it.  We have become empty with that as well.  </p><p class="P2">So there are various kinds of emptiness that are always part of how our mind is working.  And that which is empty is form.  And that which is form therefore is empty.  But if we get stuck and caught on things, we stop flowing.  We forget so easily that everything is empty from the origin.  If we don’t get stagnant and we remember this emptiness with clarity, then we’re able to see that as an entrance into the mysterious path of not-two.</p><p class="P4">18. Characteristic of Wisdom Bodhisattva said, “The differentiation of the four types [of elements] (i.e., earth, water, fire, and air) and the differentiation of the type of space constitute a duality. The nature of the four types [of elements] is the nature of emptiness. Given that the former and latter [types of elements] are empty, the intermediate is also empty. To understand the natures of the types [of elements] in this way is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Myoso Bodhisattva (Prabhaketu).  Hakuin Zenji writes of how that way of no form is form, but healthy life being one where we have forgotten our own form, and that we are in this way becoming one with the Dharma.  But our egos, caught places, get us stuck.  In the philosophy of India, there is the Earth element, the water element, the fire element and the wind element.  Always changing—the weather, the wind, the composition of the earth.  </p><p class="P2">Ninety-eight percent of our body is water, and our breath is that wind element.  And our body’s temperature is that fire element.  From the origin, one cell only, which then becomes trillions of cells, but we are all starting with that single cell and those elements.  Today there are many more than four elements.  This whole universe is full of elements of which we are made.  But originally they all came forth from emptiness.  And we go through the cycle of emptiness—becoming this form, and then that form fading and then emptiness again.  </p><p class="P2">And aren’t we all only emptiness and phenomena living? We have a strong opinion, but it’s just emptiness talking loudly.  Just a bunch of undependable transient elements and phenomena flapping its lips, being so sure.  We talk so big, but it’s only blustering emptiness.  Who should listen to that?  Nevertheless, we have to say and do what we have to do and say.  But it can’t be blind.  And if it’s going to be that way, it shouldn’t be egoistic, but rather it should be of wisdom, the trajectory of the universe.</p><p class="P2">Hakuin is talking of this life energy when he talks of that place of no form, the very order of the Heavens and Earth.  But we are empty and come to know nirvana. This is not just blustering ignorance.  This is the true order of the universe, how the universe works.  To see that and see that we are all empty and not in transient substantial bodies.  To see this and to live in accordance with the order of the universe: this is the entrance into the non-dualistic.</p><p class="P4">19. Wonderful Mind Bodhisattva said, “The eye and forms constitute a duality. If one understands that the nature of the eye is neither licentious, nor angry, nor stupid with regard to forms, this is called serene extinction. Likewise, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and tangibles, and the mind and dharmas constitute dualities. If one understands that the nature of the mind is neither licentious, nor angry, nor stupid with regard to dharmas, this is called serene extinction. To abide peacefully within this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have the Yoigen Bodhisattva (Pramati) of Indiscoverable Eternal functioning.  We have six windows: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the mouth, the body and our perceptions from mind.  Each has its own root as well.  This world—what is being perceived—is most often dualistically perceived by these windows, the sense perceptions. This  is because we don’t keep our perceiving simple.  Memory gets involved.  And then we have three times six or eighteen inputs which are being received when our memory is added to the six senses and the six roots.  We are bombarded with these constantly.  But what do our eyes actually see?  They have no idea of what is good to see or not good to see.  They are merely seeing.  The same is true of our ears and  our nose, and all of our senses.  The senses do not decide and judge about that which is being perceived.  </p><p class="P2">In the Yuikyogyo Sutra, the Buddha spoke, “ ”  If we are clear about how things are, we can see that it is because we do not align this mind that we are all full of confusion. It is as if we are harboring a great gang of ferocious animals and wild snakes in our mind.  So we have to cultivate our mind to be peaceful and calm.  And from cultivating this serenity of our mind, then that which is doing the perceiving and that which is being perceived start matching perfectly.  When this is how it is, then in that brief moment of perception everything is clear and unadulterated.  But again and again, thoughts enter immediately, and this is what brings the confusion.  To bring that mind into excellent alignment, and then our senses are also perceiving correctly, quietly and directly.  </p><p class="P1">Nansen and Riko Taifu</p><p class="P2">Master Nansen had a disciple, Riko Taifu, who one day said to him that he had been reading an ancient text, the Choron, and in it had found wonderful words that said, </p><p class="P4">This world and I are of one root, we are one and the same. <br/>All the things that I see and I are one and the same.</p><p class="P2">Rio exclaimed to Nansen, “This is exactly how it is! What wonderful words these are! If we know this then isn’t that understanding all of Buddhism?” As if he had awakened, he came and told his teacher about his discovery. Master Nansen called to him, pointing to a flower in the garden, “Taifu! This one flower! People in the world today see this as a dream.” As if to say, “what you are saying is all only conceptual and conceptually seeing it will not resolve the matter at all.” Do you really perceive with such words? Or is that only your mental picture of it? In this way Nansen responded to Riko.</p><p class="P2">It is not about understanding words but about experiencing it for ourselves. “Am I the moon or is the moon me?” This cannot be known except in direct perception of that bright autumn moon. Where do I end and where does the moon begin? This cannot be told, and this is the entrance into the mysterious world of the non-dualistic.</p><p class="P4">20. Inexhaustible Mind Bodhisattva said, “Charity and the rededication [of the merit of charity] to omniscience constitute a duality. The nature of charity is the nature of the rededication to omniscience. Likewise, morality, forbearance, exertion, meditation, and wisdom constitute dualities with the rededication to omniscience. The nature of wisdom is the nature of the rededication to omniscience. To enter the single characteristic with respect to this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Mujiin Bodhisattva, the dedication to generosity.  The six paramitas are written and hung on the wall by the back door of this room, those being generosity, virtue, tolerance, effort, meditation, and wisdom.  Among all of these paramitas, the first is generosity.  Next we have patience which facilitates the necessary efforts to be made, which then allows us to be quiet within, and that is the Samadhi.  From that Samadhi comes forth the wisdom which manifests of itself. But first we have generosity. </p><p class="P2">We see this matter of generosity, which as it is given, must be immediately forgotten.  As we say, the right hand must not know what the left hand is doing.  This is the wisdom of the Buddha.  And with this wisdom of the Buddha, for all of these paramitas as well, they are not to be used to gather our own personal merit.  Not to think that I am enduring so much, I have to be so patient, I have to do all this suffering.  If we do these for the point of personal gain, then the wisdom which comes forth from them will not be accessible.  To do them completely and wholeheartedly and then the wisdom comes forth, or else it is always only for our personal benefit.  To see it in this way is an entrance to the mysterious way of non-duality.</p><p class="P4">21. Profound Wisdom Bodhisattva said, “[The three emancipations of] emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness constitute dualities. The empty is the signless, and the signless is the wishless. If [one achieves] the empty, the signless, and the wishless, then there is no mind, thought, or consciousness. In this single gate of emancipation are the three gates of emancipation. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have number 21, Jinei Bodhisattva, the  bodhisattva of profound wisdom, teaching the three gates of liberation—voidness, signlessness and wishlessness—though they are actually three aspects of one and the same gate to non-duality. Yuju Bodhisattva was a disciple of that era who best realized the Buddha’s teaching.  As the Heart Sutra says, that which is form is emptiness, that which is emptiness is form.  </p><p class="P2">We appear to have a body, but there is nothing like that, having a body; there’s no such fixed and permanent thing.  </p><p class="P2">A name such as  ‘Mississippi River’ is given to a river, but a river is a river because the water flow is going on moment after moment: it is always in flux, always changing.  There is no such thing as a body and no such thing as a river that is constant and without change.  As soon as you point at the Mississippi river, it has already flowed by, it’s never the same river twice.  Calling it a river or a season, calling some time spring.  This is a spring.  It is a phenomena.  We say it is spring, the robins are out, but where is there such a thing as spring to be found?  The same with all of the seasons.  The weather changes little by little.  Things are in flux, but the seasons are not a hard and fixed object.  Just as our bodies and our cells are always, always changing.  And with our ego as well.  It is only a concept.  We mistake this ego, this concept called ego, for who we are.  Humans’ very weak place.  </p><p class="P2">There are seven billion people on this same planet.  If we aren’t all happy being here, then no one here can be completely happy and totally joyful.  In his Song of Zazen, Hakuin Zenji sings of formlessness: we work, we become completely that work we are doing.  We sit and we become completely that sitting.  We are absorbed into it and we forget ourselves completely.  In that way we become formless.  </p><p class="P2">From morning until night we work, and yet never do we think to ourselves, “Oh, now I’m working.”  Or while talking to others we don’t stop and  think about how we are right now talking to others.  We do get caught on many things in our mind—other people,  different, complex, challenging situations.  And to be caught on these things and our ideas and get stuck, for this we have to see how flowing water is better than stagnant toxic water.  </p><p class="P2">To not get stuck, to keep flowing no matter what comes up.  To keep flowing with it and see how we can wisely respond to each and every changing situation.  This effort must be done to avoid getting confused.  We do this by forgetting ourselves completely, and doing that is an entrance into the mystery of the not-two.</p><p class="P4">22. Serene Capacity Bodhisattva said, “Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha constitute dualities. The Buddha is the Dharma, and the Dharma is the Sangha. These Three Jewels all [have] the characteristic of the unconditioned and are equivalent to space, and all dharmas are also likewise. To be able to practice accordingly is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Jakugon Bodhisattva.  The bodhisattva who quietly sees the deepest source.  Here he is talking about the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.  The various living forms, the creatures born of mothers, the creatures like insects born from moisture, the animals born from changing form, transformation, and those born from eggs.  These are all of the same completion of life energy which means fulfillment of wisdom, which then leads to the evolution of all form.  In this way, the theory of Darwin is the same as this Buddhist view of evolution. </p><p class="P2">Ultimately, all of the Buddha’s teaching is to bring forth profound wisdom for all beings.  And there is nothing greater than this for the benefit of all beings.  2,550 years ago the Buddha awakened.  And what he awakened to is the profound wisdom that we are the Hoshin Butsu, the clean pure light in a moment of mind.  The undifferentiated light in a moment of mind.  The undiscriminating light in a moment of mind.  This is true for each and everyone.  </p><p class="P2">But if we have personal and egoistically oriented opinions and views, we can’t see from this innate wisdom with which we are all endowed from the origin.  We can’t see clearly.  It is not about an external wisdom that we take on, something to be thankful for.  Rather, this wisdom is within each of us, unhampered by any ego.  One with each and everything.  And thereby manifesting in that oneness with everything.  One with the mountains, with the rivers, with the birds, with the stars; but if we put mental ideas onto it, such as wondering “what is that, what is this”, immediately we separate from it by making it into a mental construction.  </p><p class="P2">Instead, to become the birds, to become the birdsong, to become the flowers, become that great law of all beings, in oneness with each and everything seamlessly.  This is the Dharma.  This is where limiting mental perception is not held to; then, when we have no extraneous thoughts at all, there is no more separation.  So everyone we meet is our friend, connected purely as family, as friends of the path.  We could not conflict with them.  We help and we accompany them, becoming clear minded together.  We support them.  And this is the entrance to the path of non-duality.</p><p class="P4">23. Unhindered Mind Bodhisattva said, “The body and the extinction of the body constitute a duality. The body is identical to the extinction of the body. Why? Those who see the real characteristic of the body do not generate seeing the body and seeing the extinction of the body. Body and the extinction of the body are without duality and cannot be differentiated (lit., “without discrimination”). To neither be surprised or afraid with respect to this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Shinmuge Bodhisattva talks about the body being alive.  Actually, our idea of being born and dying is only a conceptualization because humans are constantly aware and conscious about this.  Commiting suicide is an example, happening when we get disillusioned with an idea of how we think life should be or is supposed to be.  Living, if we really live, has no difference in any age.  </p><p class="P2">If we live for 80 years, we have died for 80 years.  So if we are not living, we have not died.  To die means we can’t die more.  If we have lived one day, we have died one day.  So dying does not come suddenly, even if there should be a sudden car accident.  We have been dying every day we’ve been alive.  </p><p class="P2">Of course, this is not possible to understand in a conceptual way.  It can only be realized in a place beyond concepts and mental perceptions.  When we really get it—we know when this sits right.  Only sort of understanding it is not sufficient.  It has to be deeply clear.  And for this we have to be able to let go of our physical body and all of its ego centered ideas and thoughts, and realize this once and completely.  This is the truth.  We can’t deceive it by just thinking about it or by saying, “Oh, we’re all going to die anyway,” like the people who are the suicide bombers.  We have to have this deep experiencing of this to truly understand it.  </p><p class="P2">We sit and this is why we have to sit even though our legs hurt terribly and we have great discomfort.  But the time will come, without fail, eventually for everyone.  We can go out to dinner many times.  We can do a lot things we enjoy.  But we have to experience this dying completely once, and then we can eat at restaurants as much as we want.  We have to really get this and really experience it.  As Master Hakuin says, “Young people, die completely once and you won’t have to do it twice.”  </p><p class="P2">Where Shinran Shonin, who said that no matter if his teacher Honen was not even telling him the truth, he believed in what he was telling him so deeply.  And this is a person who it took twenty years to realize this truth.  He believed it so completely that, even if what his teacher was saying would lead him into hell, he would not stop.  This is the way that we have to believe in this; and to follow it means that we are so sure that we have to do it with all our determination. But we have to do it when we know we have to.  And we have that same true, deeply inspired, determination when that is the case. Our direction is clear.  And that is when we really can do it.  The direction has to be clear, it can’t be vague and “sort of”. Then it is as if it was already accomplished.  The clarity of direction means that it is already a done thing.  That way of living a life is very important, and it has to done completely.  And this is an entrance into the mystery of the non-dualistiic.</p><p class="P4">24. Superior Excellence Bodhisattva said, “The good [actions] of body, speech, and mind constitute dualities. These three [types of] action all have the characteristic of the nonconstructed. The body’s characteristic of the nonconstructed is the same as speech’s characteristic of the nonconstructed. Speech’s characteristic of the nonconstructed is the same as the mind’s characteristic of the nonconstructed. The characteristic of the nonconstructed of these three [types of] action is the same as the characteristic of the nonconstructed of all dharmas. To be able to be in accord with this wisdom of the nonconstructed is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Jozen Bodhisattva now arriving.  This bodhisattva says that the three karmic attachments are to body, mouth and mind, and that they can be used in both positive and negative ways.  Both good and bad things can come forth from them.  These are choices we are always able to make with our body, our mouth, and our mind.  For example, violence or killing comes from hating, and they are actions, negative actions we do with our body.  Or we can use our body to help someone by carrying their heavy packages or getting up and giving them our seat.  So we can do bad and good things with our bodies. And with our mouth we can speak lies, we can speak hypocritical things, we can say things we don’t really feel, and we can insult people.  We can also do good things.  We can not speak with a forked tongue, and we can really speak positively, encouraging people. </p><p class="P2">So we have these three poisons of greed, anger and ignorance.  And they can also be expressed through our body, our mouth and our mind.  But if we clear out the unnecessary thinking and conceptualization, then the positive activities come through naturally.  If we let go of that egoistic view, we will not be caught on only praising ourselves, thinking highly of what we do and needing the approval from others for what we are doing all the time.  We think so many things in our mind, it just gets really confusing.  </p><p class="P2">To learn to use words that are truly necessary, like forgetting ourselves in whatever we are doing, and then our ego view is let go of completely so we can become clear. But for realizing this we have to actually repeat and repeat and repeat our efforts to the extent that we are able to realize what we have to do and forget our mouth, our mind and our body completely—being absorbed into each and every activity.  So absorbed in what we are doing, we become it totally.  For this we do zazen.  And it feels so hard at the beginning, but we continue and we don’t stop. As we keep those efforts going, our faces actually change completely.  He can see it.  As well, he sees how much of our time we are spending thinking things we don’t need to change.  A change comes in our way of seeing our life.  At first we are so unsure and unskillful, but we become more and more able to make the efforts we need to, and all of this manifests positively.  And this is an entrance into the mysterious way of non-duality.</p><p class="P4">25. Field of Blessings Bodhisattva said, “Meritorious action, transgressive action, and immobility constitute dualities. The real nature of these three [types of] action is emptiness. Emptiness is without meritorious action, transgressive action, and immobility. Not to generate these three [types of] action is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Next we have Fukuden Bodhisattva.  To do good things or to do bad things, this is not something which is separate.  The word love is not often used in Buddhism because when love ends so often hate sets in.  They are back and front.  So to not hold onto extraneous thinking is what is most important.  The Emperor Wu said to Daruma Daishi, “I did all of these excellent good things.  What will my merit be?”  To which Bodhidharma answered, “No merit.”  If in our mind we are thinking too much, thinking all about good things or bad things—it is better to not hold onto anything at all in our mind.  We know this is true, but if we try to produce something like an empty mind, that is also already an attachment.  </p><p class="P2">We really have to work to the place where we can not hold on to one single extra thought.  As it says in the sutras, when we don’t hold onto any extra thinking at all, our Buddha nature shines through of its own.  We repent our past unskillful behavior, but we can’t get caught on the idea of how bad we were, either. That’s not the point, or our mind becomes full of such thoughts and we can even become sick thinking too much about how we used to live.  Nor can we think too much about our own good past behavior.  In fact, until karma ripens, we cannot manifest good behavior.  </p><p class="P2">But to not hold onto any extra thinking is the best.  Always new, always fresh.  This clarity is necessary for both doing positive things and for not doing negative things.  We can’t always see why people commit crimes.  The crimes they commit appear so suddenly, but these are not crimes that came to be so suddenly.  We cannot pile things up in our mind.  To let every thought go.  To not hold onto it.  For this, zazen is most direct and best for letting go of all thoughts and not piling them up inside.  </p><p class="P2">Doing zazen while sitting, but also in all the activities of the day—sitting, standing, waking, sleeping. No matter what we are doing all day long, to pay attention to every single breath and do a complete exhalation to its last final point.   Focusing on our exhalation and not looking away from it.  Breathing naturally to its final end, we can keep our focus on it.  We do it again and again and our whole life becomes affected by this.  Somebody makes a fool of us or somebody praises us.  We only hear these as words because we are focused on our breathing so completely.  And then our mind naturally clarifies.  Filling up each and every mind moment we become fields of good fortune.  And this is an entrance into the mystery of the not-two.</p><p class="P4">26. Flower Ornament Bodhisattva said, “The generation of dualities from the self constitutes a duality. To see the real characteristic of the self is to not generate dualistic dharmas. If one does not abide in dualistic dharmas, then there is no consciousness. To be without consciousness is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.” </p><p class="P2">Next we have Kegon Bodhisattva or Flower Garland Bodhisattva, number 26 bodhisattva.  The Flower Garland Sutra was the first sutra written.  It told of the Buddha’s awakening experience.  In it he teaches to not divide our awareness.  Scholars tell us that after we are born, we first understand one, and not until we are 32 months old are we able to understand two.  Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple are said to have begun this dualism, and this is where the construction of the ego began.  </p><p class="P2">At 32 months, our data is imprinted and more and more we are able to decide things and discriminate between what we feel is good and what we feel is bad.  A very simple standard, liking what is good for them.  Even before one can be aware of the world we have our inherited qualities, but still we perceive that our mother is me, our father is me, the mountain is me and if I meet something that I’ve never seen before, that’s me too.  Any and all of it.  This is not a relative me, but the whole world is me.  In an adult we would see this as a strong ego being, but in the infant there is no attachment here yet.  This is two years before the eventual appearance of an ego. Then we become able to perceive two, and there is a self and other dichotomy.  There are other things to study, other things to try to understand.  From there, all progress in cultural understanding opens up.</p><p class="P2">But our mind’s cultivation as such is not given any more attention.  Of course, for being in society we need to be able to function in this dualistic way.  And we may need this dualistic mind to do the activity of helping others.  But we get stuck in the dualistic view with the problem of always wanting to be approved of, and then that is always lurking in whatever we do.  We pick up all kinds of data externally, but that need for approval is what the ego puts forth. We have an attached idea in our head, and we move blindly.  </p><p class="P2">There is no such thing as an ego.  We cannot really help people without the wisdom to go beyond the dualistic construction which we have taken on so thoroughly.  If we have deep wisdom we can see the ego from afar.  Religions are always teaching to let go of that self-centered view.  To instead, receive from all people equally and not with preferences.  When we see the flower directly without any separation, only then can that which is truly looking really see the flower.  To see all things as one is the entrance into non-duality.</p><p class="P4">27. Store of Virtue Bodhisattva said, “The characteristics of the attainable (i.e., the perceptible) constitute dualities. If there is unattainability, then there is no grasping and forsaking. If there is no grasping and no forsaking, this is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”<span> </span></p><p class="P2">The five precepts of Buddhism are for human beings.  This is the teaching of the next bodhisattva, number 27—to live correctly.  Do not kill life.  Do not steal.  Do not tell lies.  Do not have unclear relationships between men and women.  And do not be intoxicated.  These first five are for all people to live correctly as humans.  Our mind has to be clear, so we have these rules of the universe to be living in accordance with.  A person cannot be in the world without following these five basic precepts.  </p><p class="P2">These are not rules per se, but are natural ways of being when we live in clear mind.  They are not directed by our ego.  We are not born from our own intention to be born.  And more so this body is not our own possession.  It has been loaned to us.  So we return the body at the end of this lifetime.  We have to use it well therefore.  Following these precepts, we see how to use the body and everything well.  For example, to not be thinking that we have our own anything. That is what the precept of not stealing is—not taking someone’s something, but to not think that anything is our own. That very idea and way of looking at it is, itself, to be stealing. </p><p class="P2">As Master Ikkyu says, “we’ve been given this body for the span of a lifetime.  It’s been lent to us, and now that time is over and we return the body.”  To polish this well, so our state of mind is clear and we can follow those precepts for the length of time in which we have this body, reaching out, to be thankful to others.  But also to be able to watch and see how we can use it in the best possible way.  And this is the entrance into the door of the not-two.</p><p class="P4">28. Superior Moon Bodhisattva said, “Darkness and illumination constitute a duality. If there is no darkness and no illumination, then there is no duality. Why? If one enters into the concentration of extinction, there is no darkness and no illumination. The characteristics of all the dharmas are also like this. To enter this with universal sameness is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Number 28 is Getsujo Bodhisattva, who speaks on darkness and light non-dualism.  His name is the same as the meaning of the moon coming up.  We can see clearly as the bright light of a winter moon shines down on all things, illuminating them.  On the new moon the sky is dark, and though we hardly ever get to see a dark sky in the world today with so many lights on all over the place, to see the scenery around us, we only know it is there because of light.  </p><p class="P2">And that is why forms are called color and movement is called movement of light.  We can see forms because we can see light and shadow.  And actually if we strike a match, where does that darkness go?  Or if we put a light on, where does that darkness disappear to?   So there was never such a thing as darkness to begin with.  If we only look at light directly, we can’t find objects, and if it is pitch black we cannot find them either, even if we know there is phenomena there.  We light the phenomena.  Also, when there is light, we can see all things and see that they are equal.  </p><p class="P2">Although they are phenomena, when we can see light, we can see dark.  But that is dualistic.  Only in zazen can we go beyond that dualism to where we can absorb the whole universe into our sitting.  If we are able to do our zazen in that way, then we can be living in a way of not choosing between things because we can be absorbed into their lack of differences, letting go of our desires and complaints and free from mistaken understanding and perception.  We are no longer intoxicated.  We are a mind which is aligned and clear—this is the blessing of zazen.  Right in the very moment of realizing this, right there is the entrance to non-duality.</p><p class="P4">29. Jewel Seal Hand Bodhisattva said, “To delight in nirvana and not to delight in the world constitute a duality. If one does not delight in nirvana and does not have aversion for the world, then there is no duality. Why? If there is bondage, then there is emancipation. If there is fundamentally no bondage, who would seek emancipation? Without bondage or emancipation, then there is no delighting or aversion. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.” </p><p class="P2">Next we have number 29, Honshu Bodhisattva.  His name means the same word as the name for the zazen hand mudra where we put our left hand on our right palm and make a circle.  Holding this mudra with our hands helps us to hold the brightness of our mind.  Because we are always thinking of various things, our head is so full of different thoughts; by holding this hand mudra we are able to be more concentrated in one straight line in zazen.  When we relax our shoulders, we make our backbone straight.  We become a weightless state of mind with our body.  We become like a pyramid, solid and set.  Like a potter who puts clay in the middle of the potter’s wheel and then because the clay is in the very middle of it, they can naturally center that clay and begin to make the pottery that comes out of the centered clay. </p><p class="P2">But for most, it is a very difficult thing to do, to become so centered.  We have names for mudras, not only for the hands, but also for the whole body, such as standing and sitting postures.  For example, those who are not able to sit well in the usual sitting way come into zazen with noisy footsteps because their zazen is not centered.  When they are sitting and still having a lot of thoughts, you can easily tell by how noisy their whole being is, down to the noisiness of the footsteps that come into sanzen.  </p><p class="P2">Honshu Bodhisattva begins, if we aim to enter Samadhi and not enter the world, but it is not like that—raising a prayer to God in some solitary way and being able to be born whenever we want to and however we want to.  It doesn’t work like that.  Rather, we become able to see all things as equal.  And not be seeing with an eye that separates us from them, wishing to have it in a different way.  Having seen this and seen people who are not happy where they stand, wishing they could pray for a big change and make it happen: this only divides our mind more and more.  We want to pray for power, but there is no need to divide our mind like this.  </p><p class="P2">Instead, if we dive in and help all the people in the world with all of our time, there we will be.  We are being given these words by Vimalakirti as well.  When he said that he was not sick, that it is not that he is sick, it is that the society is sick.  And he has received the sickness.  We have to have deep faith, trust, and belief, and honor the karmic affiliations with which we have been blessed, and live accordingly.  It’s natural that we feel limited by being in a physical body, by having birth and sickness and old age and death, but to not experience these in such a way that it prevents us from entering into the non-two.</p><p class="P4">30. Crown of Pearls King Bodhisattva said, “The correct path and the heterodox paths constitute a duality. Those who abide in the correct path do not discriminate between the heterodox and the correct. To transcend this duality is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.” </p><p class="P2">Next we have Shichoo Bodhisattva, whose name means to learn and walk a clear path.  He teaches that when we try to establish a good, pure path without mistakes, we will start calling other people bad, relative to our own thought of what the good path is.  Thinking only about our own open and spacious state of mind and nothing about the others’ excellent state of mind—there is no end to personal or countries’ conflicts in that way of seeing things.</p><p class="P2">We have the precepts, Bodhidharma’s precepts number 6 and 7, where they teach us not to speak of others’ faults.  But that does not mean we have to ignore them, but to not preach to them or put them down for their faults; instead to have great empathy for them.  We have to have this kind of great inner spaciousness to help by allowing them to see how they can change and make things different.  None of us is perfect, and that is why we are always working on our practice, keeping it going.  And we also have to see that we are able to know our own foibles and difficult places.  </p><p class="P2">As an unawakened person we have many things that we have to still take care of, and after awakening as well, to continue with that.  We have to have the time to stop and see what that is and really look at it.  That is an important part of our practice.  But it’s not only the looking at it which is important, it’s the changing it, actually doing it differently.  </p><p class="P2">Today’s laws involve heavy punishment, when what is really needed is education.  We have to help people who are coming out of prison to align and then to be able to live correctly among people, or else we will never see an end to crime.  We will always be in a position of accusing it and punishing it, instead of in some way rehabilitating it.  We can’t be in a hurry for doing this.  We have to see it with persistence, and in doing it like this that is also an entrance into non-duality.</p><p class="P4">31. Delights in the Real Bodhisattva said, “The real and the unreal constitute a duality. To really see is not to see reality, and how much more so the not-real? Why? That which the physical eye cannot see can be seen by the wisdom eye, but this wisdom eye is without seeing and without not-seeing. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">We vow and work for all people to awaken to the truth present in everything. But what is that?  The religions that are trying to spread truth have the greatest conflict about this very thing.  What is that truth that needs spreading?  We don’t say these things, “what is the truth”; we don’t say that word “truth” in that way.  But the wars today are not wars about truth but about profit because people generally understand mentally what they think the truth is.  But the truth is not an idea in our mind.  It is without any form.  If there was form it could not be truth.  </p><p class="P2">As Master Rinzai says, this one great Dharma of no form extends and becomes the six rays of light.  To see this in that way.  We all have bodies and we have lives.  We do zazen to awaken to this truth, which is how we can actually see it without mental discrimination, and this is the way of the truth of zazen.  To experience this directly, and then we will know how to realize it and go beyond that noisy mind which prevents us from being able to directly see what actually is.  If we are mentally understanding it, we cannot see it in the same way the Buddha has talked about it.  </p><p class="P2">As the Buddha said, you can see my body but can you see my Samadhi?  If you enter the same exact Samadhi that I enter, then and only then can you see the Samadhi.  Here is where our root has to be set in firmly.  Without that we cannot see from that place that is the same as the Buddha’s Samadhi.  And then everything we perceive, no matter what it is, all of it is phenomena.  That truth itself can only be seen with the eyes of wisdom.  It’s not about being able to see it with our physical eye and input it with our dualistic brain.  And this is an entrance to that world of the not-two.</p><p class="P4">32. After the various bodhisattvas had thus each made their explanations, [Vimalakīrti] asked Mañjuśrī, “How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma gate of nonduality?”</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī said, “As I understand it, it is to be without words and without explanation with regard to all the dharmas—without manifestation, without consciousness, and transcending all questions and answers. This is to enter the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">The final part of this section on non-duality:  31 bodhisattvas speaking to 32,000 other bodhisattvas and other disciples of the Buddha who had come to hear this.  Vimalakirti had asked them all to please speak about their entrance to the non-dualistic.  And so these 31 bodhisattvas each talked about their awakening experience.  These 31 bodhisattvas represented the 32,000 bodhisattvas that were gathered there.  </p><p class="P2">The leader of all of them was Manjusri Bodhisattva.  Then he is asked to speak on behalf of everyone.  And Manjusri answers that each had their own awakening and experience and that was very splendid, but in fact each one had a self-conscious awareness there when they were describing their own awakening.  And therefore each was carrying along two and that was in itself not non-dualistic.  And that being non-dualistic was not the truth.  Each of you has a splendid experience, but you can’t make a description of that, or else it becomes dualistic.  To know no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing and to designate nothing, that is the entrance into non-duality.  </p><p class="P2">The flowers that bloom—if we say, “Oh, they are so beautiful,” that is humans’ description.  The flowers don’t say this about how they are blooming.  “Oh, what a beautiful birdsong,” we say.  The bird is filling the heavens and earth, giving everything to that song.  It’s not singing about its own song.  The mountains soaring into the sky filling the heavens and earth, the rivers ongoing flowing filling the heavens and the earth, the stars filling the sky.  But if we say anything, it is no longer that actuality.  It is separated from the truth.  Vimalakirti Bodhisattva tells of his own experience next.</p><p class="P4">33. Mañjuśrī then asked Vimalakīrti, “We have each made our own explanations. Sir, you should explain how the bodhisattva enters the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P4">At this point Vimalakīrti was silent, saying nothing.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent! Not to even have words or speech is the true entrance into the Dharma gate of nonduality.”</p><p class="P2">Here there is no use for syllables, sounds and ideas.  Vimalakirti gave not one sound.  And without adding a word or even half a word, he responds without responding.  He said nothing at all.</p><p class="P2">In the Blue Cliff Record, Setcho writes on this by saying, “What?  Did Vimalakirti say anything?  Did he remain quiet in order to say something or to show the saying of nothing.  For what was he totally silent?”  As of old, it is said that this silence is like a hundred thunder claps when a hundred lightning bolts appear at the same time.  And Master Hakuin said it, “The sound of the single hand.”  </p><p class="P4">When this “Discourse on Entering the Dharma Gate of Nonduality” was explained, five thousand bodhisattvas within the congregation all entered the Dharma gate of nonduality and attained forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas.</p><p class="P2">From the Buddha’s experience of awakening came the teaching of the Buddha Dharma.   The Buddha had thrown away his country, his family, his household, letting go of all of his possessions to find out what was the source of the conflict among all people, that conflict that does not end even up through today.  Why, if this could be seven billion people seeing each other as equals, can we not do that?  But because we continue to refuse to do this, we don’t share, we don’t help, we don’t support each other, so how can we support this effort to become clear and see?  </p><p class="P2">For this the Buddha threw away everything, and not meaninglessly.  But because otherwise it is too difficult to find and see the truth of all beings’ suffering.  There were all kinds of philosophers in India at that time.  The Buddha exhaustively studied all of them and still there was remaining the deep question, the burning question of how ego was necessary to live but also caused these conflicts.  So how should we get rid of that ego.  What should we do about it?  </p><p class="P2">The two hermits of the ultimate teaching of that time, he went and visited them.  They were experts on not thinking of anything and not even not thinking of anything at all.  They taught about this path and Shakyamuni studied it with them, but he couldn’t be satisfied with just that.  What about that ego question which was not resolved by what they taught him.  When we are not even thinking of any thinking, is there any ego in there or not?  If there is, then it would eventually come out and again there would be conflict.  And if not, who is it that is enjoying this not thinking of not thinking of anything at all.  They were both silent.  They couldn’t answer him when he put this question to them.  </p><p class="P2">But where is the life energy in that.  To be able to lead all people out of deep suffering, for this last point, he also left these two hermits and the ultimate explanation of truth that was available at that time. He went into the mountains at Dantokusan to work on that matter of ego that still remained.  But still that self that struggles, that self that makes efforts, its shadow, could not be extinguished.  But that quieted state of mind, could it actually resolve the question of the revitalization of all people?  </p><p class="P2">He came down from the mountain.  He washed in the river.  He received some milk, and he sat down under the Bodhi tree.  He sat until the morning star came, and at that moment, on the morning of December 8th, he was revitalized by the moment of becoming that light, that star. He had realized the state of mind of becoming completely one with the heavens and earth and saw simultaneously that which could use that very experience, that deep energy. The ability to use that was clear to him, because that deep energy had swept away the ego’s limits and could lead with that awareness that was the heavens and earth becoming his body—with that active manifestation to lead all beings.  He saw clearly that it was that ego that had obstructed that.  He awakened to that which regenerates all beings.  </p><p class="P2">The true law of all beings, it is to this that he awakened, that huge mind that is within the awareness of each of us, where there is no self, no other, no bad, no good, no dualistic idea.  At the same time becoming the mountains and the rivers, the sun and the moon.  Something which is separated from all of them, this huge true essence of each and everyone of us can also become them.  And so it is called the actualization of the middle way.  Not turning to the left or the right, the very experience of it being the middle way.  The Buddha did not agree with the view that when we die there was nothing else ever after that.  Nor did he agree with the view that there is an ego and a world when we die, that we continue in it in a different form.  Not caught on either of these views, this is his entrance to the non-dualistic.  </p><p class="P2">Thirty-one bodhisattvas had told their experiences of it, and for us as well, telling experiences is not the Buddha Dharma and is not Zen.   Each bodhisattva had told an experience, and there was no mistake in that experience itself.  But in the very telling of it we separate from the experience itself.  Manjusri also said that.  But even saying that is extra.  Vimalakirti, his was the telling by not telling of becoming of the Buddha’s very experience.</p><p class="P2">And in this way also, with the same experience, Bodhidharma had said, “Nothing sacred, only emptiness.”  Master Ummon had expressed it, “Gate.”  [Kan] Vimalakirti is not silent with no meaning, but that was an expression of what he’d experienced completely.  Our experience cannot be given by words and phrases.  We cannot explain it.  Only to be able to let go of all of the obstructions which prevent us from seeing this clearly.  And so we sit.  </p><p class="P2">All of the bodhisattvas were simultaneously awakened.  And from morning until night, night until morning, gave birth to clear life energy, brightly.  It does not have to be an expert, but to not be dualistic is necessary. Because we have piled up egoistic views, over and over again, we stay confused.  We have to once make the efforts to realize this spaciousness, to let go of all of those egoistic views.  But it can’t be done by thinking about it or self-conscious awareness of trying to do it; then we are inviting two to come along.  Whether we are doing koans or sussokan, if there are two coming along, it becomes parallel lines.  </p><p class="P2">To let go of that self-conscious awareness that presents the parallel line.  To cut this very, very deep continuous mind noise, we do the Mu.  To cut that root, to get to that root of our awareness and cut it completely.  At the beginning it is so constantly present.  So we have to continue and continue and continue with it, whether we’re standing, sitting, sleeping, waking.  For this reason as well, we have to exhale to the very last point of the exhalation.  We can feel that end and then cut it all.  Doing sussokan, we breathe to the point where there’s nothing left, and then we give one or two light final pushes.  </p><p class="P2">Difficult at the beginning, but as we keep doing it, the inhalation eventually breathes itself, where the heavens and the earth are breathing in, and then everything piled in our heads is suddenly let go of.  So the deeper we get, the more we feel clear and the more clear the mind becomes.  But we have to become one completely with the heavens and earth.  If we drag in two again, it is as if we are always carrying around two.  </p><p class="P2">In Zen this is what is most important.  We have to encounter that deepest root, actually and completely.  Zen is not a mind game.  We have to experience it to realize it or we are not revitalized.  It’s very clear.  It is like having to actually take this and go to the most final point with it, no matter what.  We can’t compromise, because otherwise we end up with just mental understanding.  And although a mental understanding may start us on this path, we have to go beyond that to realize it and experience it.  </p><p class="Standard">Daruma Daishi came to China when they already had all kinds of Buddhist teachings, everything you could think of except for the experiencing of it.  And to be that experiencing of it, he went to China.  If we continue now to deeply sit, to do it to that place where we have let go of every single last thing, this is what is important, and it can be done right now.  </p></body></html>
