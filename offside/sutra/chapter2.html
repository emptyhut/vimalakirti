Through yesterday we have been reading the Buddha land section, set on the ‘stage’ of the city of Vaisali with the Buddha himself appearing.</p><p class="P2">For us to live in peace, each person in each country in the whole world must live with peace within. If we live in conflict within, this will bring continuing, ongoing problems. The Bodhisattva Vow is for the liberation of all beings. All beings are endowed with Buddha-nature. We are all endowed with the Buddha’s wisdom, innately, but we are not aware of it. In order to live we need food, water and shelter. But if our mind is twisted, even if our material needs are taken care of, we are all still living in discord and dis-ease. We have to clarify our mind to all live in peace. This is why the first chapter was about the Buddha land and realizing this true wisdom within and the Bodhisattva Vow.</p><p class="P2">In the first chapter on the Buddha lands, Vimalakirti himself doesn’t appear. Now we will leave the garden of Amrapli near Vaisali and enter the city to meet Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P2">We have Three Realms: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Pure Matter, and the Immaterial Realm. The first of these is the Realm of Desire—always wanting, always wishing for more than we already have, always greedy to have more of what we already have. To be desiring and greedy in this way is to be in the Realm of Desire.</p><p class="P2">Second is the Realm of Pure Matter—always studying and learning about things, always reporting about them, and working according to what we understand and what we study in a mental way—thinking that is an actuality. If we see the stars we study about astronomy to find out about them. If we see human beings we study about medicine to find out about them. We see earth and ground and we study about geology to find out about them. All the various studies are born from here; this is the world of matter.</p><p class="P2">And then there is the Immaterial Realm:  a world of high quality creativity, where we give life’s enjoyment expression in poetry, in pictures, in literature, in songs.  If we see the moon we write a poem. We make meals in accordance with the various seasons. </p><p class="P2">People do not necessarily function in just one of these realms. We go back and forth between them. This is how the world is, and how it operates. But all of these three realms assume that this world exists, and we get caught in that delusion. So these three realms are considered worlds of delusion. To pierce through that attachment and that delusion—that dualistic, mental, rational view—we have to be guided by those who can see in a different way.</p><p class="P2">Without fail, this material world will fade away.  So when we die, where do we go? How does the world transform constantly? Before existing, where were we? And after extinction, where will we be then? This switch is called the Buddha-nature. To awaken to this wisdom—this is our purpose. But when we are caught in the world of mundane business and material matters, we need someone who sees the bigger picture to guide us, and that is a bodhisattva. The bodhisattva cannot be too different from us, or we can’t relate to them. And so we need someone like Vimalakirti to appear—a lay person who works in society and has a family life, who makes great offerings to the Buddha’s way, and who also goes through struggles. People without struggles don’t know what people in pain actually experience. For deeper wisdom, we need to know the mind of people who are in deep pain. Otherwise we won’t know how to approach them. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti is not merely a wealthy and intelligent man but a man whom anyone would recognize as a person of excellent character if they were to meet him.  If we translate this name it means “Name of Purity,” or “Nature without Defilement.” There was no one who could honestly talk about Vimalakirti in insulting or derogatory terms. He was really a person of balanced, all-embracing character. This layman Vimalakirti was a person who could prostrate to each and every person he encountered. He considered every person he met—each and every person—to be a Buddha. He was deeply awakened to the intrinsic beauty of the clear Mind. Of course this did not apply to humans only. The tree in the garden, the flowers, the birds, the rocks—he saw that all of these were endowed with the true state of Mind to which the Buddha had awakened. He saw the whole world from this broad and open state of Mind, and he respected each and every part of it.</p><p class="P2">He saw all of existence from a deeply loving Mind. It was to this Great Mind that he had awakened. At the same time, no matter how much good he did for others, he was never self-consciously aware of it. Always putting others first, there was never a trace of thinking about having done so. His Mind was innocent and clear, simple and uncluttered. He had no attachments and was stuck on and caught by nothing. He never tried to push his opinions onto people. He was always manifesting only for the sake of what others needed. When he would talk to people it was never from his own personal opinions that he would speak. He was only speaking so that the other person could realize the truth, awaken to what is real. People who would listen to him would think, “So that’s how it is! Now I get It!”</p><p class="P2">At the same time he had abundant wisdom, and this wisdom was not just knowledge. He was not one of those gifted people who knows a lot about a certain subject—a genius in information. He had the profound wisdom that sees through to the very essence of how things are, and from that place comes the wisdom of how to best function in the world. Because he was awakened to that abundant wisdom he was able to move freely and broadly. Also because of that wisdom he was unmoved by things, not tossed about or caught by events or people. One could always feel the manifestation of his clear Mind, which was free from attachment. </p><p class="P2">People are commonly afraid of many things in their deepest heart—whether it’s fear of the pain and suffering that come with being alive, or the fear of not succeeding in one’s life work, or that anxiety of being insecure—the question of life and death. Vimalakirti was free from all of these fears because he had entrusted everything completely. He had seen through to the essence of the Mind.  He had entrusted everything, exactly as it is. In accordance with that deep wisdom he was able to see clearly how to guide others in their liberation. He could see the direction in which a person’s Mind was moving and recognize what they were being confused by or suffering from. He could see the source of that suffering. He could see what would have to be done in order to resolve that suffering. He could see easily to the bottom of these questions.</p><p class="P2">He was always aligning his clear and bright Mind in order not to do anything unnecessary—manifesting that most important way of living for a true Buddhist. He was able to put his everyday life in order from the deepest Mind and to be satisfied with how he was able to live in that way. That Mind was deep and wide like the ocean, embracing all living things—with their suffering, confusion, and delusions. His Mind was huge and abundant in this way. Since he was this kind of person he was respected by everyone around him.</p><p class="P2">We can continue praising his character, going on and on, but the point is to say that Vimalakirti was able to blend in with any stratum of society, wherever he was and whomever he was with. He would use all expedient means possible to liberate the people with whom he came into contact. Vimalakirti was able to go anywhere he had a karmic connection, to illustrate the correct path for people there, and to creatively guide them on it. In Vaisali, when Vimalakirti teaches, gods, bodhisattvas, Buddha’s disciples will always gather. This then is the story of Chapter Two. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti, of his own will,  became sick in order to work for the liberation of all beings. People don’t usually like to be sick. They really dislike it. But Vimalakirti felt that even sickness was a teacher. Since he was a famous person of wealth and wisdom, the king, the head ministers, other famous and rich men, lay people in training, people of religion such as Brahmins, sons of lords, people who worked for the city in positions of responsibility, all heard about his being sick.   Everyone worried about him and wanted to go visit him. So without him having to go see all of these people, they all went to visit him instead. While lying in bed he could see all kinds of people in great numbers, and he could teach each one of them about the truth. This was his very individual way of functioning. </p><p class="P2">To all the people who would come and visit him he would first use his sickness as an entrance to speaking to them about the Dharma. “Everybody, if you think because you are healthy you can depend on this physical body, that’s a big mistake! This physical body—no, all of these physical things in existence—they’re all transient and in flux! You can’t depend on them, you know! We don’t know when this body will topple over. It’s a very weak and fragile thing! It will at some time be used up and finished with. You can’t trust it! It is just as the Buddha described it—life is full of suffering and confusion. Your body is a vessel for sickness! Just as I am now on my back with sickness, this body is truly fleeting.” He taught in just this way. </p><p class="P2">He was teaching just as in the poem of old times:</p><p class="P1">Will it be me who goes first?</p><p class="P1">Will it be someone else who dies first?</p><p class="P1">Without knowing where we will end up today or tomorrow</p><p class="P1">Not knowing who will go first, who will go later.</p><p class="P1">Like the single drops of dew <br/>on the leaf of the green tree, <br/>each of them eventually falling,</p><p class="P1">Returning to the moistness of the tree’s roots. </p><p class="P2">We truly don’t know if it will be us who dies first or if someone else we know will die first—whether it will be today or tomorrow or another day. No one can know this. But whether it is today or tomorrow, like the drops that fall naturally from the tree’s branch, all of them fall and flow together to the ground. Every single one falls—some sooner, some later. Life is truly fleeting. </p><p class="P2">Just the other day a group was on a delightful trip sightseeing in Taiwan. Then suddenly, in one brief moment, 265 people on the plane from Taiwan were dead, due to bad judgment by the pilot of the airplane. No one who went on that trip with the intention of doing it to die. In the photos taken on the plane before it burned, everyone was smiling and laughing.  They were sharing stories of their travel adventures, and they were all anticipating their return to their homes. Pictures of their happy faces remain, yet all of them would be dead in just a few hours. This is what life is like. This body is something which we absolutely can’t trust. </p><p class="P2">To realize deep enlightenment and not hold on to attachments in our Mind—to see the truth; people who can see from the eyes of deep wisdom don’t depend on this physical body. And if we look at it from these eyes of wisdom, it’s like a waterfall which sends off a mist as it falls. There is no substance to the mist of the water falling. It appears to be there but it has no substance. Our body is the same. It’s like a bubble born from the water—it looks as if it exists, but it breaks and vanishes in an instant. </p><p class="P2">This body is like the shimmering wave that appears to hover over the field in the springtime. It shimmers and the air seems to move, but in fact there is nothing there. The small personal love or shadows of a desire where this body is, is like such a place. We peel away a layer and find another layer, peel that away and find another. As we peel away layer after layer, eventually it is all completely gone. We think that there is something actual within us—some kind of hard core—but if we really look at it there is nothing at all. This body is like a phantom. We think it exists, but it’s like a dream.   </p><p class="P2">The moon when seen in the water is nothing but a reflected picture of the source. It doesn’t really exist in that puddle. This body is like that, or like an echo in the mountains. It doesn’t really exist. It’s like the rain clouds of a thunderstorm—they seem to be there, but the shapes are soon broken apart. It is like lightning that shines brilliantly for one instant and then disappears, to be found nowhere. This body is like the earth’s floor under our feet, only a gathering of dirt and some plant life. All varieties of phenomena are gathered there, but this body is nothing but a combination of materials. It is nothing but an aggregation of atoms and molecules. This body is just the burning of the flame of the ego. </p><p class="P2">Fire has no substance of its own. Because something is burning, flame also comes into existence. It depends on the wood. The burning form of the wood gives life to the fire’s apparent form, but in fact there is no substance to it. The wood which is burning—when it finishes burning, the flame is also finished. The ego also is only something which lives as long as our body does. When our body dies, that ego which has clung to it also goes. Even if we believe our ego to be something splendid, this is all there is to it. A wind blows but it doesn’t blow forever—it eventually stops. There is no life that lasts forever. Our life is the same as that—only lasting as long as a wind blows. Whether the wind wants to or not, it eventually dies. </p><p class="P2">This body does not belong to anyone and no one can decide for it. It’s like water—it has a certain shape now but at some time it will decay and disappear. As the life energy in it is finished it will be over and done. The four elements that make up our body—these are all of nature—while we are alive they gather together and when our life is finished they return to nature. So we can’t stop and call it “my body.” This body is truly unreliable. This is what Vimalakirti taught to everyone who came to visit, using his sickness to show them that it was the problem of each and every one of them as well. <span> </span></p><p class="P2">In this way the chapter tells about Vimalakirti’s excellent character and of how he became sick in order to teach and liberate people. He encouraged them in their awakening from this fleeting transient life as a physical body, helping them see how to awaken and what to see as important in life. </p><p class="P2">Finally he told them about how we each have two bodies. These two bodies are the body of form and the body of the Dharma. The body of form is our physical body and the body of the Dharma is the body of truth. We have these two bodies. Please think about which is important—Vimalakirti teaches this to us carefully and kindly. First, we live with this body—this body of form. But within it and beyond it—yet using it—there is a splendid, excellent, high-quality second body. This is the body of the Dharma, our eternal life. It is not something that we possess personally. People in the world, while they think that this Dharma body which connects and unites all people is the most important aspect, are still too busy with the material world in front of their faces. Numb and dull, they concern themselves with narrow personal pleasures instead. They think that this narrow ego is all that there is to life, that the time when they are alive in this particular form is all that there is to life. The physical body will decay and fade away even if we try to prevent it. It can’t last forever. Everyone knows this. Still, while knowing this we stay attached to that limited physical life. This is because we don’t know the value of that eternal life.</p><p class="P2">Our physical body is a tool, and to use that tool we have our spiritual body within that physical body. This is our True Self which lives and is our center. Because we have to clearly and actually realize this Original Self, Vimalakirti is telling us just how this physical body which we all think is so important comes from that gathering of the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water. When we die it returns to these elements and has no absolute or fixed substance to it. </p><p class="P2">Everyone thinks that the food and possessions and objects which they use are their very own, but it doesn’t work like that. There isn’t anything we can actually possess. When we die we have to let go of all of it. This body of ours is the same as the trees, the grasses, and the stones. It cannot escape from the laws of nature. Even if it doesn’t want to, it has to face its ending.</p><p class="P2">We can’t do anything about it. This body may seem to be our own, but it can’t be controlled by our own orders, decisions, or wishes. Not only that, but in our eyes we get sand, in our ears we get wax, in our nose we get snot, we get filth and dirt all over our bodies. We are really made up of various unclean parts. We feed our body and put on good clothes, we eat delicious food and polish ourselves up beautifully to be shown off—but at some time we are going to have to let go of this body. We will all become ashes no matter how well we care for our bodies; at some point the meticulous care becomes extraneous and meaningless.</p><p class="P2">In this way Vimalakirti taught everyone about the ignorant person’s way of life. All people must die at some time. “Everybody! This unclean, transient, and unreliable physical body—you can’t depend upon it or be attached to it! Don’t be attached to this physical body and think it will last! That clear Mind which lives in and unites all peoples’ Mind—this is what must be developed and realized. That important true character must be developed to where it can support all people. This is what has to be done!” This is how he taught. No matter how much money one may have—we can’t walk around with it forever. We have to give it back in the end. No matter how many kimonos we have, we can’t wear them all at once. That true, clear character and bright Mind—no matter where we go we don’t have to give it up. Even when this life is over that bright Mind will still be supporting countless people.</p><p class="P2">What is that true, clear character? If we think that it is some wonderful decided thing, that’s a great mistake. That which is the source of all, that which unites all people, is that Mind of zero. When we make our own Mind zero, we can get pleasure out of the smallest thing. If we are truly zero we get joy out of the slightest kindness or friendly word. As the Buddha said, people who have nothing in their Mind at all are not stuck on an idea of themselves—no matter where they find themselves, that is their own home, their own world, and they can see it in that way. That Mind of zero, to awaken to that clear character! To stop doing all things that are bad and to do everything we think is good—to put it into action—from this will come forth that great expansive Mind which unites and is understood by all people. Things that we know are bad are the wishes of the ego. Things that are good reach all beings. From here the Buddha nature is brought forth. The true character is born from this Mind of sincerity and honesty. Not to guard that small idea of self, but to give everything to the whole of society—to work carefully and inventively in this way, then our Buddha nature will be realized.</p><p class="P2">To put it in a different way, a clear, simple and expansive character of zero gives birth to that true character, and from that character comes forth true compassion. That Mind which moves to comfort and aid all people, the Mind of joy which lets go of everything—this is the Mind which is given birth. From within oneself an expansive and harmonious life can be lived. This true character’s deepest source—to awaken to it! And if we want to liberate people from their suffering, first we have to realize this deep awakening, realize that deep Mind which is inside of each of us. The wonderful realization of that clear original Mind is what has to be done to begin with. </p><p class="P2">This actual physical body’s pleasure—that is not the most important thing. To awaken to that deep clear Mind is the matter of greatest importance—the most important thing to be done in our life. First and foremost we have to awaken to that clear true original Mind: knowing that a clear state of Mind is more important than our physical pleasure, and in one straight line living according to that clear nature.  Seeking always to live according to the original Mind—that excellent character with which we are all endowed—this is how Vimalakirti, while resting on his sickbed, would teach the Dharma to each person. Many people would then awaken that deep vow to bring all beings to the realization of this clear original Mind. </p><p class="P2">An Indian, Vimalakirti’s name in Chinese translates to “Bright Name” or “One Whom All People Respect,” that is one about whom no one complains. This is the state of Mind he had. Another name for him was “One Who Is Round and Perfected.”</p><p class="P5">1. At that time there was within the great city of Vaiśālī an elder named Vimalakīrti. He had already made offerings to immeasurable buddhas, deeply planting the foundation of goodness. He had attained forbearance of the nonarising [of dharmas], and his eloquence was unhindered.</p><p class="P2">To vow to liberate all sentient beings, to vow to liberate all beings, all things, this is what clarifies our value as human beings. We see all kinds of people and we say “Good morning” to them, “Hello,” “Good night”—to our family, to our friends, to our neighbors. These greetings are one of our offerings. We open our Mind, and from our Self we speak and begin a conversation. We see someone with a problem by the side of the road, and we stop to help them with their car. Seeing an elderly person standing, we give them our seat on the bus. We give an offering to a dirty place in the city by cleaning it up. We make efforts to give offerings to dogs and cats and other animals. To give offerings to all beings we raise flowers, we grow trees and bushes. We take care of plants and we do things for the animals and for the places; that gives birth to a world of joy and of harmony. We don’t do this for our own profit and benefit but to give life to everything that exists. We express our Mind, and we receive all things that come to us without discrimination.</p><p class="P5">He disported in the numinous penetrations and had achieved all the <span class="T1">dhāraṇīs</span>. He had attained fearlessness and had subjugated the troubling vengeance of the Māras.</p><p class="P2">This is a description of our ideal way of being—what we should be aiming for in our life, things that most people can’t do. The great super-knowledges—to be able to see what most people can’t see; to be able to hear what they can’t hear; to be able to fly in the sky; to be able to walk on the water. In Buddhism there has never been any mention of anything that is supernatural, only about doing things which we are already innately and naturally able to do well. But because we only do what we think benefits or profits us, we often don’t use our huge potential or get to see parts of our deep character.  That which we don’t like, we don’t feel like doing. We see with our eyes and we hear with our ears, we taste with our mouth. But if our mind is always irritable or is caught by all kinds of extraneous thoughts, we get confused and chaotic. For this reason we have to align our own mind and free up our stuck places. </p><p class="P2">If we become too full of delusions we can unclutter that by doing susokkan. And zazen is one way of doing that. Otherwise we get so irritable and so aggravated! Instead we do our breathing, extending each exhalation. We expand widely—and we always come from there to a place where we become quiet. And since it works, we do it some more, and clarify further:  a greater breath and a greater depth of Mind.</p><p class="P2">We are always wanting to freeze others; this is an expression of one kind of fear. We have to liberate ourselves from this fear. If we align our state of mind, that fear naturally goes away and new wisdom can then come forth. We have all kinds of fantasies and ideas that obstruct us—to let go of all of those. This is what Vimalakirti knew how to do.</p><p class="P5">Entering into [all the] gates of profound Dharma, he was excellent at the perfection of wisdom. Having penetrated skillful means, his great vows had been accomplished. </p><p class="P2">He had a deep wisdom which was free from any small self filter. He could see the best way to be. After we align our awareness—we do sussok’kan deeply and go to where there is no longer anywhere or anything left to be caught on, for everything is all wide open—we become this openness and then we can receive everything. We know from deep within the four Bodhisattva Vows that sentient beings are numberless, and yet no matter how impossibly difficult it is to liberate so many, we vow we will do that impossible thing.</p><p class="P2"> Our desires are innumerable, and yet we vow that we will let them go, that we will not be a slave to them. The Dharmas are also infinite, and yet we vow that we will master them. Again we say that we will do the impossible, to keep our awareness sharp, clear and awake. Finally, we vow to become the Buddha’s Way—a promise that we will continue to keep clarifying our Mind.  This is how Vimalakirti was.</p><p class="P2">Understanding the tendencies of the minds of sentient beings, he was also able to discriminate between those of sharp and dull faculties.</p><p class="P2">He taught the Dharma appropriately to each. When we see people we can often tell what they are thinking or what is going on with them. However sometimes if there is a person who is famous or has some kind of special, big presence, we get taken in by their appearance and we can lose our clear perception when we’re around them. But since Vimalakirti was not hung up on appearances or on how people looked compared to himself, he was never swallowed up by a person’s existence.</p><p class="P2">We all have to gassho to each and every person, to be that respectful to all people.  And if  someone is left out, then that is a problem. That we never stop expressing this respect for <span class="semiBoldItalic">all</span> people is very important.</p><p class="P5">Long [a practitioner of] the path of buddhahood, his mind was already pure, and he was definitively [dedicated to] the Mahayana. He considered well the activities of the realms of existence, and, residing in the deportment of the Buddha, his mind was great as the ocean.</p><p class="P2">We have to observe and correct our behavior carefully. This is true for all of us. Wherever we go we should behave in the best way possible, with true manners and politeness, because these are always the basis of actual harmony. It cannot be manners that are merely formal. We often see that some people with money or status are treated one way while those of a different class are treated another way.  Vimalakirti was always humble and acted the same toward every person, no matter who it was. As the Buddha had said, to wear what we need to—what is sufficient for when it is hot and for when it is cold, but not to wear strange-appearing, attention-drawing things; not to be luxurious and not to do things that are exaggerated. To be careful with how we act and how we appear: in that way, we can live harmoniously with others. Harmonizing is to live in a way that we are at one with everyone else and to act with a Mind like the great, huge ocean.</p><p class="P5">The buddhas praised him [as their] disciple, and the Indras, Brahmans, and world lords (i.e., heavenly kings) revered him.</p><p class="P5">2. Wanting to save people, [Vimalakirti] used his excellent skillful means to reside in Vaisali where, with wealth immeasurable he attracted the poor; with the purity of his morality he attracted the miscreants, with the moderation of his forbearance he attracted the angry, with great exertion he attracted the indolent, with singleminded concentration he attracted the perturbed, and with definitive wisdom he attracted the foolish.</p><p class="P2">Many people praised Vimalakirti—all the disciples, all of the various heavenly gods. We are all insufficient humans, but to see this big-hearted way of being and make it our goal to work towards it is important. If we are not stuck, if we are not caught on a small state of mind, then we can know this way of being and realize that we are endowed with the large Mind that we have had from the origin. Not to use that Mind to satisfy our own individual interests, but to offer it for to the realization of all beings—for this we do sesshin. And from there we can see clearly what is the best way for us to be in society.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti arrived from previous lifetimes of being a Buddha, a Buddha who saw the discord of the whole world. He came into the Vimalakirti body to resolve the struggles and conflicts of society because  society could not be left like that.  </p><p class="P2">It’s not about how pitiful we each are. We just say to ourselves that we are pitiful because we see ourselves only partially. But we are all so much bigger than that. To see ourselves differently is what we have the Buddha Dharma for. We have to see this clearly: we are not insufficient at all. And to realize this great possibility in each of us we have the teaching of Vimalakirti and the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P4">Day Six</p><p class="P2">We have described Vimalakirti’s character, and from today we will talk about his way of using liberative techniques. Today’s India is so different from India at the time of Vimalakirti. Today there is no way there could be a person of such wealth as Vimalakirti. In those days his money would move the country, and he used all of his resources to save all suffering people.  But money is not an endless possession.  The human Mind, however, is eternally Buddha-nature. For clarifying this with people he would use liberative techniques.</p><p class="P2">Layman Vimalakirti is his name, but in his past life he was a Buddha. Looking into humans’ source, it was three billion five hundred million years ago that we were first born on this planet as Life energy—all of us. We could say that we, too, were born as Buddhas. A baby is born new and fresh and simple; at birth we all have the mind of a Buddha. But twisted by the world, by our conditioning, our experiences, and our jobs, we all get caught and stuck with an egoistic view. We have to turn that around. To do that we turn to that clear and pure place, our Buddha-nature.</p><p class="P2">We follow the lead of Vimalakirti in living the way of the Precepts: we get up at 3:50 in the morning without bothering anyone else, and we live and eat in an aligned way all day long.</p><p class="P5">with the purity of his morality he attracted the miscreants, with the moderation of his forbearance he attracted the angry,</p><p class="P2">Living and behaving in an aligned way all day long is not so easy to do while in society. People by themselves have a much harder time maintaining the kind of practice we can do here, and as we know, it is not so easy to do that even here.  The use of the keisaku can be hard, even if it is to bring people into clarity. We can return home and live harmoniously with our family, but here we have to keep going even if we weaken and have a very hard time. Yet we are supported here and have others helping us to keep going. We do this knowing Vimalakirti could maintain self-control and tolerance.</p><p class="P2">We have so many things to see and hear and touch and feel out in the world, but here at sesshin, we work at concentrating in a focused way, supporting each other by not talking and socializing in order to maintain our awareness and learn from our seniors’ example. We are often bombarded by our senses—our seeing, our hearing, our touching, our feeling, our tasting, our smelling—instead, here we use them in a simple way, to directly see, hear and feel. If we are having a hard time and are upset, we can’t see the flowers in the world or the beautiful scenery, even when we are so close to it. We forget our gratitude for everything that we have received. At sesshin we’re able to return to the wisdom that allows us to renew that gratitude. As a lay person, we have work and family when we leave but at sesshin we can be with those who train professionally and learn how to cultivate our state of mind in the best possible way.</p><p class="P5">3. Although he was a white-robed [layman], he maintained the pure Vinaya conduct of a sramana; although he resided in the home, he was not attached to the triple world (the Three Realms—the Realms of Desire, of the Material and of the Nonmaterial).</p><p class="P2">In India the word for a lay man is “ubasoku” and the word for a lay woman is “ubai,” and the words came to China where a layman is “koji” and a lay woman is “daishi.” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti lived a life at home, yet it was not a life of the Three Realms—the Realms of Desire, of the Material and of the Nonmaterial. The Nonmaterial Realm is of a higher level than the other two (the Realm of the Material and the Realm of Desire). We find in this world of the Nonmaterial, musicians, sculptors, poets, and composers. We recognize what they create. Yet even to acknowledge all of this creation, even if it’s not material, it is still considered as reality, whereas reality is delusion since none of these things of form will actually last. They are all the world of phenomena, of flux, and they will go away. The layman Vimalakirti, although he lived within the world of form, he knew well the world beyond form and beyond life and death—the world which was not caught on the material or even the nonmaterial. He knew that excellent creations were not all there is to it. Beyond delusion there is deep Mind, which unites us all and in every era. He saw this clearly and knew that this world is the source of the whole great universe. We have to see this and return to this place, which is what we have zazen for. </p><p class="P2">In order to see this—that there is nothing in existence that is of a fixed, permanent form and that all things are phenomena—we have to first recognize that today’s world around us is always changing and then realize deeply and clearly what does not change. We have to awaken to see how it is. We come here in order to do that. We put aside the things that are moving so quickly in society, and we are able to better see how this change is constant. While we are here we are able to realize that place which is slightly different, which isn’t always only involved in that ongoing change.</p><p class="P5">He manifested the existence of wife and sons, but always cultivated chastity. He revealed the existence of subordinates, but always enjoyed transcendence. Although his clothing was richly decorated, it was with the marks and features [of a Tathāgata] that he adorned his body. Although he drank and ate, the joy of concentration was his [favorite] flavor.</p><p class="P2">In a home life in society most people have partners and many have children. If we are part of a couple we strive to deeply respect each other and hold important each other’s depth and breadth and quality of mind. To do this, it is very important to maintain our practice.  To be an example for children as well, we have to work on realizing our original nature. To live a life with a partner and truly respect each other—children can see very clearly if it’s just a performance which is superficial, or whether it is true respect. Whichever of these it is deeply affects their upbringing.</p><p class="P5">Although his clothing was richly decorated, it was with the marks and features [of a Tathāgata] that he adorned his body.</p><p class="P2">We go to many gathering places and we wear the appropriate clothing for the place we are going to. But it’s not about the clothing and decoration of ourselves, but rather about whether or not we match directly with and touch intimately each person within, connect to them in the most important way beyond any decoration.</p><p class="P5">Although he drank and ate, the joy of concentration was his [favorite] flavor.</p><p class="P2">We have to eat and drink to stay alive—but to do it and not be lopsided in it. To enjoy the simplicity of eating and drinking with focused attention, eating with others while simultaneously working to make sturdy their deep vow. This is the way that Vimalakirti was.</p><p class="P5">If he went to gambling houses or theaters it was only to save people. He hosted those of the heretic paths without breaking his correct faith. Although he illuminated the profane classics he always took pleasure in the BuddhaDharma. </p><p class="P2">Since he lived in the city he would go to places like casinos and horse racing tracks. And when he was at those places he would teach those who were gambling that there were also other great ways to pray and to play, and of greater value as well. He also visited the places of worship of many religions that were existing at that time. </p><p class="P2">Different regions and different neighborhoods have their own variety of religion. To be a true religion, it cannot have lost its original character from when the religion began. Neither can we be intoxicated on a religion. We cannot be in a religion that makes us confused and rules over us because of it. True religion accepts and welcomes all people, including those of other faiths. Today’s religion is sometimes a way of using people, even using people’s lives to crush other religions. One example of this is the suicide bomber who wears a bomb in the name of their God. That is not any longer really a religion at all. True religions have to be aligned and help us realize our alignment with our clear Mind.</p><p class="P5">4. In supporting the correct Dharma he attracted both old and young. In all of his business dealings, although he made worldly profits he never took joy in them. In wandering the crossroads, he dispensed benefit to sentient beings. In entering into government administration, he safeguarded everyone. In entering into the lecture halls, he led people by means of the Mahayana. In entering the schools, he inspired the children. In entering the brothels, he revealed the transgressions [that arise from] desire. In entering the wine shops, he was able to maintain (lit., “establish”) his [good] intention.</p><p class="P2">In order to be in harmony with people Vimalakirti associated with elders, with those of middle age, and with the young, yet he always spoke in harmony with the Dharma. He engaged in all sorts of businesses, yet had no interest in profit or possessions.</p><p class="P2">No matter where he went he always made great efforts, and wherever he was people felt abundant and huge in his presence. He would go into places and speak words that were believable and convincing. He would tell young people to deepen their minds in a way that they could see clearly. They would begin to sit zazen and realize what it led to. Eventually a group would form, and he would support their efforts and provide them with some kind of material support. But if not careful, that could turn into a way of making money for profit. It is important to not be caught in that kind of a cycle. He would see through these things very clearly.</p><p class="P2">He would go downtown, like going into downtown Seattle on a weekend day when people had a day off from work, and he would see people hurrying around; he would tell them that they should not be hurrying around so much and should each do sesshin at Tahoma. Always he would urge people to deepen their state of mind. He would go to political meetings and make sure that they weren’t addressing issues superficially or in a way that would harm people. He would go to schools and make sure that they were not forcing some kind of superficial teaching on the students or filling them full of useless conditioning. In this way he would work tirelessly at liberating everyone.</p><p class="P5">5. When he was with the elders, as the most honored of the eminent he explained the excellent Dharma for them. When he was among retired scholars as the most honored of the retired scholars he eradicated their attachments. When he was among ksatriyas, as the most honored among ksatriyas he taught them forbearance. When he was among brahmans, as the most honored among brahmans he eliminated their arrogance. When he was among the ministers, as the most honored among ministers he taught them the correct Dharma. When he was among princes, as the most honored among princes he instructed them with loyalty and filiality. When he was among palace officials, as the most honored among palace officials he converted the palace women.</p><p class="P2">He would always teach in accordance with the people he was joining, and with those groups he would show them this place beyond the material world. Not just to be centered within the world, as if that was all there was, but he would tell them about wisdom and seeing beyond the stratum of life and death, seeing broadly and looking at our behavior in that context. This is how Vimalakirti lived. Because he worked all day long with great effort to see far and clear, people respected him.</p><p class="P2">There were many different castes in existence in those days as well. He was honored as the prince of princes because he would reverse their attachment to royal pleasures and sovereign power.</p><p class="P2">He would tell the aristocrats that they would die some day and there was no guarantee that they would be reborn as royalty or aristocrats. Maybe they would even be reborn as a Dalit (the lowest caste) or a person who was then considered of an untouchable class. He would tell them that there was no way of knowing how that was going to come out, so they should align the way that they behave now. He would speak frankly and openly and honestly about these sorts of things.</p><p class="P2">The high-ranking politicians would make time available for him.  He would urge them to work for equality among all beings so that people could all be deeply respectful of each other.</p><p class="P5">6. When he was among the common people, as the most honored among the common people he had them generate the power of blessings.When he was among Brahman gods, as the most honored of the Brahman gods he taught with superior wisdom. When he was among Indras, as the most honored among Indras he manifested impermanence. When he was among world-protector [gods], as the most honored among world-protectors he protected sentient beings.</p><p class="P2">He would tell those in the realm of the heavenly-beings that they did not know if they would continue to be heavenly beings. They could at any time drop down into the worlds of hell realm, hungry ghost, brute, or human. They shouldn’t assume that how it was now is how it was going to be forever.</p><p class="P5">The Elder Vimalakrti used immeasurable skillful means such as these to benefit sentient beings.</p><p class="P2">He was always working with great clarity and energy throughout society. Vimalakirti was continuously and tirelessly engaging in liberative teachings. What is being pointed out here is not only about Vimalakirti, but it is a way of life for liberating all beings.</p><p class="P2">We have this very precious opportunity to do sesshin. The wisdom that we are able to realize here is not our own personal possession, but it is for increasing harmony among all people. We get to do one week of zazen and deepen in our zazen so that we can go and share what we realize—this huge state of mind—with all that we encounter in the world. We have to do this, or else we are turning our back on society and fall into a kind of narrow perspective because of that. It is not for this narrow perspective that we are here this week, but for all beings’ awakening. </p><p class="P2">With Vimalakirti’s teaching in this chapter we see how to go about helping humans realize that deepest truth. Pure mind, not moved around—quiet within but also seeing hugely from this clarified place. To not be thinking that we are superior, or even worse, to attack ourselves for being insufficient: this is the important wisdom that we learn from Vimalakirti. Don’t become lax in your focused efforts!</p><p class="P4">Day Seven</p><p class="P5">7. Using skillful means he manifested becoming ill himself. Because he was ill, the king, ministers, elders, retired scholars, brahmans, the princes and the other palace retainers, and innumerable thousands of people all came to inquire about his illness.</p><p class="P2">Layman Vimalakirti would go everywhere using his skillful means, exhaustively teaching the truth of the Buddha Dharma. This was his way of being human. One of those skillful means was that Vimalakirti became sick.</p><p class="P2">Sickness is said to occur when our ki is damaged—our mind can be twisted when we are not comfortable with how things are in our surroundings, and there are many other reasons why we become ill. But mostly we become ill because we mistakely think that we are permanent and fixed beings. For Vimalakirti it was different.</p><p class="P2"> Later he was asked in the text, “Vimalakirti, why are you sick?” And he answered, “Because all people are sick. I am sick because of this world; it is so sick in so many ways that I have become sick.”</p><p class="P2">Sickness does not only mean to be bedridden. To live uncomfortably and miserably in this world is also a sickness. Vimalakirti says, “I am not sick, but this society is sick and I cannot bear this.” The Buddha has said, “All of the places in the Three Realms are my home and all of the beings in those three realms are my children. This world is this hideous place, and that is my responsibility. These are all my children that are in so much pain! Whether they are good children or misbehaving children, they are all my children. It is because they are not awakened that they behave in this unskillful way.”</p><p class="P2">For Vimalakirti, all people were his children. In the same way that if we have a house we have to check for a leaking roof or that the doors have been shut when we go out, and that nothing is in disrepair in the structure; all of this is our own responsibility. “And all the children born there are my children. Even when they get big and go out into the world, will they be ok or not? They are still my responsibility. Whether it goes well for them or not is a matter of great concern for me.” In this way of the mind of a parent, Vimalakirti saw people in conflict and could not be comfortable with their pain. So he became sick like a parent who cannot sleep deeply when their child is sick and then gets sick from not having any rest—Vimalakirti was sick like this because he felt so deeply and directly all the pain of the people in society. And when they arrived to visit him, Vimalakirti taught them the Dharma, beginning his discourse from the actuality of the four main elements.</p><p class="P5">8. To those who came, Vimalakirti used the occasion of his illness to make extensive explanations of the Dharma.</p><p class="P5">“Sirs, the body is impermanent, without strength, without power, without solidity. Given the way it rapidly disintegrates, it cannot be trusted (i.e., relied upon). Alternately suffering and vexatious, it accumulates a host of illnesses. Sirs, the wise do not rely on such a body.</p><p class="P2">Everyone would come to visit Vimalakirti and say, “Vimalakirti, this is terrible!” And he would say to them, “Yes, indeed it is.” We think we will always be healthy because we feel good now. But as Buddha taught, nothing is permanent. Everything is always in flux and changing. We never know when we’re going to topple over. We never know when our health will no longer be sustainable. The body is a vessel for so many different pains. And in just being alive you have to worry about so many concerns. We cannot depend on this body; it is not reliable.</p><p class="P2">Will I go first or will that other person go first? When will it be? Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. It is like the dewdrops on the branch—which one will fall first? There is no way to know who will die next; we don’t know who it will be. Who will be hit by a car? Or be in an airplane crash?  So many toxins in our blood causing who knows what? Our usual yearly health exam—to what degree can we depend on what it tells us? Those dewdrops hanging from a branch—which will fall first to the ground? There is no reliability there.</p><p class="P5">9. “This body is like a bit of foam that cannot be grasped. This body is like bubbles that do not last very long. This body is like a mirage, generated from thirst. This body is like a banana tree, with nothing solid within. This body is like a phantasm arising from confused [views]. This body is like a dream, an illusory view. This body is like a shadow, manifested through karmic conditions. This body is like an echo, dependent on causes and conditions. This body is like a cloud, which changes and disappears in an instant. This body is like lightning, unstable from one moment to another.</p><p class="P2">People of high rank would come and visit Vimalakirti and he would send them off, saying, “Don’t depend on that body! It’s like the endless bubbles that fall down a waterfall and then flow down the river, but they all will burst. Some of them pop in five meters, some of them pop in ten meters. Some of them pop in twenty meters, but all of them—born from the same waterfall at the same time—every single one of them without fail will eventually break.” This body is like the bubble. When we take a bath and cover our body with bubbly soap suds, those bubbles will pop and break until eventually all of them are gone.</p><p class="P2"> We think by fulfilling our physical desires we get pleasure, but we always pay later. We are like an onion being peeled off one layer after the next. We peel off one layer, and there’s another layer after that, and when we peel that off there’s another layer of onion, and another layer. Thinking there’s something hard, substantial inside, we peel away all of the layers. But, there is nothing left. It’s like a flash of lightning. The flash begins—a great flash—and then it’s over. And then another great flash, but then that’s over; they are completely all gone. It’s like a dream—no substance! As is written in the Diamond Sutra: </p><p class="P1">“Thus shall you see all these things: Like a dream, like a phantom, like dew, like a bubble in a stream, like the lightning in a summer sky, and a cloud—thus should we look on all that is made.</p><p class="P1">“It is like a dream being an unreal vision. It is like a reflection being the image of former actions. It is like an echo, being dependent on conditioning. It is like a cloud, being characterized by turbulence and dissolution. It is like a flash of lightning, being unstable and decaying every moment. The body is ownerless, being the product of a variety of conditions.”  </p><p class="P2">Our body is like a reflection of the moon in water, like an echo in the mountain. We think someone is there, answering. But when the echo ends, nothing continues; like the summer cloud which starts from one small cloud and then grows into a flow of many shapes of all kinds and then fades away. When lightning flashes in one instant only, it seems to exist so strongly, but then is gone. This earth, too, is always changing. Tall mountains become flat. The ground feels so solid until an earthquake comes and then it becomes a muddy swamp. We think the earth is grounded but it is moving endlessly under us—like fire, or like wind, wind which goes from left to right, strong to weak. Wind, which appears to exist and move things around, actually has no substance.</p><p class="P2">This body does not belong to anyone. We cannot control it; it is only a gathering of molecules and atoms, of cells all of which will change within seven years, except those of the brain. That means that we are a different person  every seven years. All of these cells that we are right now will decay. </p><p class="P2">Everyone who would come to see Vimalakirti would be taught in this way.</p><p class="P5">10. “This body is without master, like the earth. This body is without self, like fire. This body is without lifespan, like the wind. This body is without person, like water.</p><p class="P5">11. “This body is insubstantial, being housed in the four elements. This body is empty, transcending self and the qualities of self. This body is ignorant, like plants and rocks. This body is inactive, being turned by the power of the wind. This body is impure, replete with defilements.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti would teach everyone who came, about our melancholy, transient, condition. So what should we believe in if we are going to be dissolving and disappearing? What essence can be depended upon? So what is the truth?</p><p class="P2">According to the Buddha Dharma, there is the Dharma body and there is the physical body. Buddha taught that there is this body that we are born with, made of molecules. And there are joy and feelings and a sense of the value of life. When we feel this value, we feel we can do anything. But if we sense the body and life as meaningless, then we are only melancholy.</p><p class="P2">We were born, and at about age twenty we finished our physical growth. And then we just care for this physical body, sustaining and caring for our molecules with no further growth happening. But to realize the truth within those molecules, within that body—that is important, or we feel this ongoing meaninglessness.</p><p class="P2">We have this deep Mind, this Dharma body. This is not about the idea of having a soul that is eternal, but about that wisdom which uses this physical body. There are many kinds of wisdom, some are found externally through reading or various experiences. But that wisdom which is from our inner depths is the truth of the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P2">Not to have a transient body for no purpose, but to aid others with it and bring them joy. Anyone can know this. But everyone, no matter how much they help, will die. And so we have to awaken to the higher wisdom within.</p><p class="P2">When one dies, some believe there is an eternal soul which never dies and goes into a different body, going from being in one body to being in another body. In the Buddha Dharma, however, there is wisdom—the Dharma body—and that is the whole universe, which is our truest body and which we have karmic affiliation with in various bodies that we live as. When we die these molecules and atoms will transform. From the origin of the whole universe—which is a sea of atoms and molecules—in accordance with cause and effect, we change, we become, and we transform. This is the way of truth of the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P5">11. “This body is insubstantial, being housed in the four elements. This body is empty, transcending self and the qualities of self. This body is ignorant, like plants and rocks. This body is inactive, being turned by the power of the wind. This body is impure, replete with defilements. This body is untrustworthy, since even though one washes, clothes, and feeds it it will necessarily disintegrate. This body is a disaster, vexed by a hundred and one illnesses. This body is like a well on a hill, pressed by age. This body is unreliable, dying in spite of being needed.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti then continues with his melancholy description. We are only existing as a human for a short time, and then we return to molecules. This body has no true form or substance. When we are three we develop this fixed, deluded, ego. And to preserve this we make money and we create an environment. We gather clothes and food and possessions, but in fact we have no actual form. We are like gravel. We are a whimsical turn of karmic affiliation.</p><p class="P2">We have the story of Baso Doitsu who was sitting zazen on the mountain of Nangaku Ejo, who came up and </p><p class="P1">Nangaku Ejo asked, “Why are you sitting here?”</p><p class="P1">Baso Doitsu said, “I’m going to become a Buddha by sitting here.”</p><p class="P1">Nangaku Ejo sat down next to him and he started to scrape a tile with a stone. </p><p class="P1">Baso Doitsu said, “What are you doing?” </p><p class="P1">He said, “Oh, I’m making a mirror.”</p><p class="P1">And Baso Doitsu said, “You can’t make a mirror by scraping a tile with a stone!”</p><p class="P1">Nangaku Ejo said, “Do you think you can make a Buddha, sitting down there on the ground with your body?”</p><p class="P1">“Well,” said Baso Doitsu, “then what should I do?”</p><p class="P1">To this, Nangaku Ejo answered, “If you have a cart and you have a horse, and you want it to move, do you beat the cart or do you beat the horse?” </p><p class="P2">As long as we are only polishing our body we are only going to get a polished body. We have to work on our state of mind of innate wisdom—which is not just a form or a posture. That is an outlandish fabrication. These eyes—who sees? The eye itself cannot see. These ears—who hears with them? Just these ears cannot hear. This nose—who smells with it? Just the nose itself cannot smell. This mouth—who tastes with it? Just the mouth itself cannot taste. These hands—who holds with them? Just the hands themselves can’t hold. These feet—who walks with them? Just the feet themselves cannot move. If they would all move by themselves, then a dead person would be moving. So what is it? Who is it? What moves these? If we are just moving our body around, there is no truth in that—our body, made up of clumps of ear wax, snot, and rivers of drool.</p><p class="P5">“This body is like a poisonous snake, a vengeful bandit, an empty aggregation. It is the composite of the skandhas, sensory realms, and sensory capacities.</p><p class="P5">“Sirs, this [body] being so calamitous and repugnant, you should wish for the body of the Buddha. Why?<span> </span></p><p class="P2">We can’t be conceptual about this; we have to look at this directly. Even if we go to the gym and spend hours and hours on body-building, we still end up becoming a wobbly old person. We are like a vessel for sickness. We don’t know what’s going to come next. And we don’t know it when we’re young, but when we get older and one pain, one challenge after another comes at us; we’re even wishing that death would come and help us out of this. Water springs forth from a newly dug spring with a big, surging energy. But when that water is all used up we have nothing but an empty hole in the ground. This is how our body is.</p><p class="P2">Its duration is never certain—certain only is its end in death. This body is a combination of aggregates, elements, and sense-media which are comparable to murderers, poisonous snakes, and an empty town, respectively. Therefore, you should be revulsed by such a body. You should despair of it and should arouse your admiration for the body of the Tathagata.</p><p class="P5">12. “The body of the Buddha is the body of the Dharma. It is generated through immeasurable wisdom and merit. It is generated through morality, meditation, wisdom, emancipation, and the knowledge and vision of emancipation. It is generated through sympathy, compassion, joy, and equanimity (i.e., the four immeasurables). It is generated through the perfections of charity, morality, forbearance and adaptability, energetic exertion, meditation, emancipation, samadhi, and learned wisdom (i.e., the six perfections). It is generated from skillful means; it has been generated from the six penetrations; it is generated from the three illuminations;</p><p class="P2">After all, this body is bound to die. The body decays. But great wisdom has to be realized; it never decays. As long as Life energy is continuing, that great wisdom will revitalize. To realize that wisdom we spend all our time polishing our body. When will we polish this wisdom?</p><p class="P2">It is like serpents, or a gang of thieves, or a ghost town. We think this body exists, but it is only a borrowed vessel. All of you have wisdom. There is that ego and its thoughts; don’t be stuck on those! That great wisdom is what has to be realized, that which embraces everything! Our Dharma body realizes the wisdom of all beings. But we don’t realize this wisdom, so we have to hold precious the Precepts, the Six Paramitas, to polish our wisdom and not be grasping after physical existence.</p><p class="P2">Knowing we cannot rely on our body, we use it to align our daily life, clarify this wisdom, and offer that clarity and wisdom to all beings. But we must not stain that compassion and deep Mind with our ego, or it all becomes something we do for our own personal benefit only.</p><p class="P2">There are many ways to polish it, but if we do it from our ego it only increases our ego hold. We have to make that ego hold less strong. As long as we acknowledge and are ruled by that ego, then we are always involved in our personal preferences. As it says in an old poem,</p><p class="P6">So sad, so desolate at our parents’ dying, </p><p class="P6">Only more concerned with who gets the most of our parents’ wealth...</p><p class="P2">We are like ice and water; our ego is like that hardened ice—selfish and hard, while our water nature is that nature which melts and changes forms as necessary for all beings. Our training helps us become that water.</p><p class="P5">“it is generated from the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment; it has been generated from concentration and contemplation; it is generated from the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen exclusive attributes; it is generated from the eradication of all the dharmas that are not good and accumulation of all the good dharmas; it is generated from the truth; it is generated from the absence of negligence.</p><p class="P5">“The Tathāgata’s body is generated from immeasurable pure dharmas such as these. Sirs, if you wish to attain the body of the Buddha and eradicate all the illnesses of sentient beings, you should generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi!”</p><p class="P5">13. Thus did the Elder Vimalakīrti explain the Dharma for those who inquired about his illness, causing innumerable thousands of people to all generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti continues to say that all existence, the Buddha, this world, is our true body and our truth. “My body is sick,” he says, “because all people are sick. But I have to see and take each step to improve, to liberate all beings—which is the base of curing oneself.”</p><p class="P2">To align one’s everyday life and live for all beings with a huge liberated state of mind—it was for this that Vimalakirti had become sick.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
