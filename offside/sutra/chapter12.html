At this point the World-honored One asked Vimalakīrti, “When you wish to see the Tathāgata, in what ways do you view the Tathāgata?” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “As if contemplating the real characteristic of my own body—so do I view the Buddha. </p><p class="P2">“When I view the Tathāgata, he does not come in the past, does not go in the future, and does not abide in the present. </p><p class="P1">We start here, but he wants to review what we learned together up to this point in the Vimalakirti Sutra. </p><p class="P1">This has been preceded by those pages before this where all the bodhisattvas have returned from the far away country of Amariyen where they were asked by the Buddha when they came back from that country, what did they see?  As the Buddha had said to them before that it is not in compounded things or in non-compounded things that the Buddha can be seen. And these very things that were heard in a teaching like this, through what they had seen in that far away country in the same way that if it is the form of a Buddha, which is prayed to, which is honored, then that is a great mistake. </p><p class="P1">In our death we touch our material body’s finishing. If we are wise we know already that this body is only something that we are in this particular life. But the true master is the wisdom of knowing that this is clearly a body for only this life but not the true master and not that which is eternal beyond that. Knowing that clearly is important. </p><p class="P1">We have the Theravadin tradition, who have preserved what was said from the time when one could actually hear the Buddha teaching. Hear the Buddha himself , hear his words in person and put them into daily use as your guide and teaching.</p><p class="P1">The Buddha who had thrown away all of his inherited material goods, seeing clearly this is not where true happiness lives. He went to travel in order to realize the truth beyond the material and the suffering which goes with it. Hundreds of years after his death, when his teachings were being limited only to ordained people, people of household living were encouraged from that time on, to open up to Buddha’s teachings as well, then the Mahayana became. That this teaching is not only for a few limited people who are ordained and live in a monastery or a temple. That we have to not depend on that form of ordination or a monastic situation to awaken, we have to awaken for ourselves to this. To give our efforts to that while still be living in the society, with a house and a family. </p><p class="P1">This then brings up the question, “What is the Buddha?”  To realize our true nature, to give that same Buddha and be it and how we may live even a hundred years or so, to use those years for guiding others in the same process, that was the most important part of what we are learning about in the previous pages. This is what we are alive for and but we have to hold precious our karmic affiliation to our parents and to our family, but our wisdom is greater than that. </p><p class="P1">Our wisdom is there to inform our physical body and our ego, but what is the Buddha?  The true master. To help the people learn what this is, the question has to be brought forth, “What is the Buddha?”  The Buddha is not something obvious and just sculpted in wood, sculpted in metal. </p><p class="P1">A piercing through, piercing through all of that which is visible and material, right to its source and not mentalizing it, not conceptualizing it. This is what was said in the last chapter that we read.  That if we get caught on a form of Buddha, it will not be receiving this actual being. To find true joy not in mental ideas but in experiencing this. </p><p class="P1">When Manjusri comes to visit Vimalakirti, Vimalakirti hails him and says, “Manjusri you have come without coming and you go without going.”  In this same way, there is no, there is absolutely anywhere no coming and going. But we all have an idea that we come and go and do all kinds of things. When we are totally empty minded in how we are, it is as Master Ryokan has written, “The flower blooms and the butterfly comes.”  The butterfly comes to the flower as it blooms. There’s no intention, the butterfly is empty minded. They flower is empty minded. There is Ryokan’s state of mind expressed in these words.</p><p class="P1">This butterfly and this flower have no way of communicating and talking about this ahead of time. This world is natural like this. It is empty minded in every single way. We fill it up with all kinds of plans, and ideas and mental understanding of how we think it is. Our future idea about this, considering how it was in the past. But the Buddha’s world is not like that. It is a pure mind with no special awareness yet it all comes forth naturally and works. Human relationships that are also empty do not have corners and conflicts. It is because they are free from heaviness. It is our heaviness that brings us down and makes us have conflicts and bump into each other. To remedy that we do zazen. And this is why Vimalakirti says, “When I see the Buddha, I forget everything else and there is nothing there to be seen.”</p><p class="P1">In the Diamond sutra it is taught, if you see me as a color or you see me as a voice, you don’t see me. In Buddhism there is no guiding external being to be thankful to which is called, “a Buddha.”  We all have physical bodies and are born. We eventually return these bodies. We leave this realm therein expressing the world of birth and death. A physical body existing, we use it. And with it must realize that all embracing deep mind or we are merely a phenomena. This world is a huge state of mind and we have to see the essence. How to live here. Not merely slipping away from our form but with this environment having been used as our stage. </p><p class="P1">A tall growing tree needs many many leaves. Wherein we receive this sun and are shiny green in the summer. We are various colored in the autumn and then fall to the ground in the winter, returning the fertilizer to the ground. We are each like a great tree which functions then drops its leaves and completes one life so that other living ones may be able to come forth. Living in this way, each and everyone has a limited life and so we have to feed our plentiful bark before we retire this tree to the earth. </p><p class="P1">But we are not plants. We are each free, working to help this world. Unsure at times whether we are helping it or wrecking it. If we make this environment our true substance, this whole Universe’s environment is also then represented. We can’t similarly just do whatever we feel like whenever we feel like it, but have to consider how it affects the whole picture, the planet, the universe and as they last, then so do we. Our Dharma body then continues in this way. We give life to future generations. Our Buddha Nature’s life energy. We have to see this continuum or we just think that it’s not a problem if we just do whatever we feel like in any given moment. We have to see from this mind of wisdom and see this particular angle of the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P1">Shukoku bodhisattvas were all asking for a true teaching and it was given by the Buddha. Until then they had all thought that this is how life was in all realms. They didn’t need any teachings anywhere because as they were, everyone was learning from the exquisite fragrance. The truth only has to be taught when a person doesn’t already know the truth. And for all of them that truth was being brought to be known by this fragrance. And so all of them felt they needed to know in order to be able to teach. To teach about this teaching. And hearing that things were understood by giving a teaching, they knew that it was necessary to teach others. </p><p class="P1">Until then, their own learning had been all that was of interest and importance to them. But now they knew that teaching others was important. And not being satisfied only by themselves. In order to lead the world’s, for this they all listened. And to not just throw out all of the things that they hadn’t needed before, rather with the new wisdom they wanted to go everywhere and teach. Shukoku, that country where they came from, didn’t have this particular variety of teaching so they had to learn how to deliver these teachings to all people. </p><p class="P2">1. At this point the World-honored One asked Vimalakīrti, “When you wish to see the Tathāgata, in what ways do you view the Tathāgata?” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “As if contemplating the real characteristic of my own body—so do I view the Buddha. </p><p class="P2">“When I view the Tathāgata, he does not come in the past, does not go in the future, and does not abide in the present. </p><p class="P1">The Buddha is asking what were those bodhisattvas hoping to see in him?</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answers, that the Buddha  lived 80 years and had a body,. He is not talking only about him. While this body lasted for eighty years, this teaching we are hearing and training that we are doing, this practicing of the truth that he taught is right now. The true eye of each of us is opening. This deeply seeing eye is the Buddha. And the truth is beyond era and location. It was passed on to Kasha Sonja, Anan Sonja, Shonawashu Sonja, Bobikuta Sonja, further on down to Daruma Daishi, going from there, the five houses and the six sects. And then to Japan and now to America and Europe, this truth spreads. This is what it must be for it to be Buddha. Not about a Buddha’s statue which we prostrate to, but one realized by each and everyone of us, beyond any form of male or female, healthy or sick, old or young. People realizing their lives well in society. It’s beyond all of that. These are all manifestations, phenomena. But the Buddha is beyond all such form. </p><p class="P1">As Master Rinzai has said, “In this five foot lump of red flesh, there is a true person of no rank which is always coming in and going out. If you haven’t seen it yet, see it now.”  The body which decays, even if it is healthy right now, each of us while having a body of a man or a female, or whatever shape, we go beyond this shape, beyond this intellect to where no rank can possibly be assigned. That which extends throughout the entire universe. A nose who smells all fragrances, eyes that see all sights, that which gives these functioning is beyond that body itself. For each person to experience this beyond any dualism and without the wall between self and other. Becoming that mountain, becoming that river, becoming the flowers, the birdsongs, the sound of the rain dropping, the moon, the sun, but only a mental understanding about becoming these will not do it, only a direct perception of this world, a direct perception of this world. </p><p class="P1">We will all lose our functioning eventually. Even if we are healthy right now, our emotions get twisted. We get the insecurities that comes often with elderly age. Our body becomes undependable. But this beyond any of that, any of that as Master Tosotsu has said in his three barriers, “Those of you who are coming to train, parting the weeds, going through the grasses, hitting the darkness not knowing what to do next, is all being done for one reason and one reason alone and that is to realize your true nature. Tell me monk, where is, what is that true nature?” He puts this question to them. </p><p class="P1">In the world many people come to visit. A business man comes to visit. A city worker from city hall comes to visit. From the community they come. When they come, they talk and they ask, but it is because there is nothing to see. Vimalakirti says he sees him as he sees himself. Not by emotions or ideas but he sees him and that way to say that there is only empty mindedness there. To see the tathatgatha is to not see the Tathagatha. To be seeing without any ego, expectation or view, to see self and other requires ego but we can’t bring that into this. </p><p class="P1">The whole universe is our life energy. To see that quality. To see the voidness of forgetting oneself completely and then every person we can clearly see that person’s potential and capability. This is how he answers the question. We don’t have to be trained in that wisdom to see from it. The entire universe can see and this is how we see this. Not any way of seeing a form of a person but he then asks I see him as not born from the past, not passing onto the future and not abiding in the present time. What do I see you ask?  One without any part of them in the past being thought about, in the future being considered, or even in this very present moment. It is only in this now that we can even ask and this is only in this now which is then a different now that there can be an answer. </p><p class="P2">1.4. “I neither view him as form, nor view him as the suchness of form, nor view him as the nature of form. I neither view him as feeling, conception, process, or consciousness; nor view him as the suchness of consciousness; nor view him as the nature of consciousness. </p><p class="P1">This is coming from the Heart Sutra. It is said about seeing the world from the point of view of ego. Tasting the world and feeling that it is the world with our body that is perceiving from these five windows from which we see things. For example, a flower which is red and a tree which is green and from there we are always bringing in our various inclinations to movement in accordance with what we perceive. Our past experiences and how they then inform that moment are added. And to this our eyes, our ears all of our different sense perceptions come in as well. The essence which is the reality of matter, but he is not matter, this is our version of reality. </p><p class="P2">1.5. “He does not arise from the four great elements and is identical to space. He has no accumulation of the six sensory capacities, and his eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind have already passed beyond and are not within the triple world. </p><p class="P1">But the Heart Sutra says it is all empty. But because we grab at all those different things that we are motivated to do and see, not just do them and perceive them but have them, that’s why we get attached. We think that all of those things are actual. We see and we sense and we use our intellect but it is not anything but emptiness. There is nothing there that we need to be caught on but we are always getting attached as if there is. We have capabilities but to have these capabilities but to not be attached to the fact that we have them. </p><p class="P1">Matter is only phenomena. But a body is only matter and we cannot be attached to that 60 billion celled always evolving or fluxing void. To forget that body, but it was empty from the first place. From the origin anyway, it has always been empty. It’s as if we are not attached, it’s as if we are attached to which has never existed. It is the same since it has always been. To not be caught on that either. And then we naturally are healthy. </p><p class="P1">People who are sick are always attached to the part of their body that is sick. If a cold we’re attached to that. We have a hurting leg, we get attached to that. And they give all that attention to where they are sick, making themselves more and more egoistically dualistic. To forget all of that. It’s not about giving your attention to your physical parts. Nor is it about giving your attention to the Buddha’s physical parts. It is in this way that he answers this question.</p><p class="P1">Borrowing the mouth Vimalakirti, he says this and he talks about how, “Like the element of space, he does not abide in any of the four elements. Transcending the scope of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, he is not produced in the six sense-media. He is not involved in the three worlds, is free of the three defilements, is associated with the triple liberation, is endowed with the three knowledges, and has truly attained the unattainable.”</p><p class="P1">Borrowing this mouth, Vimalakirti, he is saying all of this. But we don’t understand what is going on with that. In the same way that master Ikkyu asked when a child novice why does it say in the Heart Sutra that there’s no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind, when of course there is. Of course he asks that. We are all confused by this tool. We try to figure out how is the body, how is the Buddha relevant to this tool. </p><p class="P1">And so Buddha asks why are they wanting to look at him. Wheat are these people, the bodhisattvas from another world wanting to hear from him?  What is it that they’re trying to find by looking and hearing?  And he borrows Vimalakirti to say this for him. </p><p class="P1">And in that way Vimalakirti answers about what we perceive with our six senses, that they are actually empty. We are both empty inside, and that which is perceived from the outside is empty. The Buddha is not involved in any of those worlds, inside or outside because they are empty. But we don’t leave our experience at that. We are so motivated to know all about everything, everywhere, we think that it is so important. But it does not make us any better the more we know, it makes us more dualistic. It does not develop us further. Instead we become less and less open minded. </p><p class="P1">He sees and hears and the Tatagatha has reached the extreme of detachment in regard to all things. He sees and hears from necessity. But without any attachment to any of those things which he perceives with his senses because all of that attachment only can come from ego and that is not so of the Buddha. And this is the same thing as Master Rinzai has said. To be able to add no second thoughts or third thoughts on to anything that we perceive. When we can just see things as they are, just hear things as they are, without adding on anything to that whatsoever from our mental noise, our point of view, that is of more value to us than ten years of pilgrimage. To see it as it is. To hear it as it is and leave it just like that. But we add on extra things all the time and that is what is constantly confusing us and detaching us. Just see it as it is and leave it at that and not make our mind noisy, and convoluted about those things which we perceive. To empty mindedly perceive and then add on nothing at all. We just make it more noisy. That is not the way of the Buddha. To just follow what is necessary and not follow just because we are conditioned to do so. And this is why we do zazen. To not be caught and attached. Rather to live in that empty mindedness and for this we have zazen.</p><p class="P2">1.6. “Having transcended the three defilements, he is in accord with the three emancipations. Complete in the three illuminations, he is equivalent to ignorance. </p><p class="P2">1.7. “He is neither the single characteristic nor different characteristics. He is neither a self-characteristic nor an other-characteristic. He is neither without characteristics, nor does he grasp characteristics. </p><p class="P1">As we have said yesterday, talking about the three liberations, that of becoming void, that of not being caught on any form and that on not being caught on any idea of doing or not doing. To let go of all of these. To be free of all of the defilements of anger, greed and ignorance. To know the three knowledges which when we sit we know because we are quiet and we can often see past lives or how it is after death because we can see all of these. But to see clearly, just what is happening or what has happened without being caught or attached to any of that. </p><p class="P1">To see what is exactly happening in this moment and not be caught either on that. Rather to use that emptiness, our clarity of mind, to realize the four wisdoms. The all-embracing perfect mirror wisdom which sees everything exactly as it is. The universal nature wisdom which sees everything exactly as it is and sees it in its all equal quality. To know the marvelous observing wisdom, to see everything and be able to know what it is and how it works and then to be able to know the perfecting of action wisdom which allows us to be able to respond to each and everything, the most appropriate way for it to be responded to. </p><p class="P2">1.8. “He is not of this shore, nor of the other shore, nor of the current [of samsara] in between, yet he converts sentient beings. I view him in extinction, yet he is not permanently in extinction. He is neither this nor that, and he neither uses this nor uses that. </p><p class="P2">1.9. “He cannot be understood with wisdom, nor can he be known by consciousness. He is without darkness (i.e., ignorance), without brightness (i.e., understanding), without name, and without characteristic. He is without strength, without weakness, and neither pure nor defiled. He does not occupy a region, nor does he transcend the regions. </p><p class="P1">To be able to see these things and yet to not be moved around at all in the having of any of these wisdoms. To be able to use our capabilities in our best possible way because we are empty. And this is the character of the Buddha. All of these. But seeing them all as equal and to not think that there are such things as attainments or not attainments. Nor such a thing as an other shore nor thought of any of that idea about attaining or not realizing. Rather just thinking in accordance with what the world needs most and yet with no idea of having done that or known it. </p><p class="P2">1.10. “He is neither conditioned nor unconditioned. He is without manifesting and without explaining. </p><p class="P1">We cannot live without thinking but neither can be die in being drowned by that thinking. Rather to put that thinking aside and live our capabilities to their fullest. We have a cold or a physical challenge to our body but to not get caught on that. Just like we don’t get caught and stuck by thinking about our breathing when we’re sitting. If we think about physical condition and our breathing then it becomes more and more difficult to let go of that. If we leave our body and breath alone, then that is the best way for us to bring it to its natural balance and then our zazen can be huge and free and immeasurable. But we have to not give it extra thinking and let it be as it is. </p><p class="P2">1.11. “He is neither charitable nor stingy, neither observant nor transgressive [of the precepts], neither forbearant nor angry, neither energetic nor lazy, neither composed nor perturbed, and neither wise nor foolish. He is neither sincere nor dissembling, neither coming nor going, neither exiting nor entering. All the paths of words are eliminated. </p><p class="P1">The bodhisattvas that accompanied Vimalakirti wanted to know what makes a Buddha. Gautama Siddhartha awakened to the truth under the Bodhi tree. For 21 days he deepened his awakening and then he considered how to share the truth of what he had realized. So he went to Sarnath where his friends with whom he had trained in austerities were staying. He taught, guided and awakened all of them. </p><p class="P1">At that time there was only the dharma and this small sangha, nothing called Buddha yet. Buddha means this historic person, and it also means something different that goes beyond history. The Dharma is the Buddha, not just a person at some point in history, but the Dharma is the Buddha. </p><p class="P1">When Ananda asked when the Buddha was about to die, now what were they to do?  The Buddha said, “Do not seek refuge externally. Seek refuge within. Do not seek refuge in external things. Take refuge only in the Dharma”. When the dharma is clear to us, everything is clear and right, to see the dharma allows us to resolve everything and to see how to be. </p><p class="P1">If we are not yet awakened, we realize Buddha nature by following the Dharma. The Buddha is what is that meets this Dharma.</p><p class="P2">1.12.“He is neither a field of blessings nor not a field of blessings. He is neither one worthy of offerings (i.e., arhat) nor not one worthy of offerings. “He neither grasps nor forsakes; he neither has characteristics nor is without characteristics. “He is identical to the true limit and equivalent to the Dharma-nature. “He is indescribable, incalculable; he transcends appellations and measures. He is neither great nor small. </p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti continues talking about this saying that Dharma as a person is Buddha. And paradise is that land of Dharma that is promised. But it is not a person. As Master Hakuin has said, this very place is the land of lotuses, we realize the Buddha and know Nirvana. If we are angry, everything in the whole world looks angry to us. If we are greedy, everything in the world has that appearance. And if we are ignorant, in the same way the world is affected by how we’re seeing it. This is the serenity of Nirvana. But the whole world is in emptiness.</p><p class="P1">When we have clutter within, we are unable to see this way. Also Buddha taught how the world is all every single bit of it, emptiness. To know what this emptiness is, is only possible when we totally let go of all mental ideas about differences between things. To be able to see things just exactly as they are but only an improved world is possible by seeing it through Dharma, so void and empty. We do not make two different separate worlds. To be having a world of training and a world of not training is not actual. To bring those together, for that we do zazen. Zazen is about these all coming together and being zero. </p><p class="P1">Master Joshu was asked by a monk, “What is the path?”  And this is the words in taoism. The way of Heavens order is our natural nature. And to obey this way of the Heavens, this nature, that way is the path. This does not mean to do things in a different way. It means to follow the rules of nature, the four seasons, the way things are. To in hot weather, to live accordingly. We don’t need a complicated explanation to see this. </p><p class="P1">Nansen also asks Master Joshu what is the path. Sanso Kanji Zenji, the third patriarch gave the words, “The great path knows no difficulty. Only avoid picking and choosing.”  This world is undivided in its perimeter. We know no differences, there’s nothing that we have to see and compare there. A cat and dog are alive in every way, but they cannot train. And this is what Sanso Kanji Zenji was saying. Nansen answered, “The everyday path, that is the way.”  </p><p class="P1">“How do we know then?” he asked, the monk continued. How do we know then the everyday path?  To see that walking at a red light is wrong. And Joshu continues, “How can we know this everyday path?”  As Master Nansen says, “If we think of it as a something special, then we can’t know it.”  If we think there is a special thing we have to know to know what is this everyday path then we can’t know it. And that makes it very difficult to know what to do. We have to see this world in accordance with how everything works. We have to work ourselves on this. </p><p class="P1">From the age of five we have been gathering dualistic information and ideas and it makes it difficult for us to see things in the natural way. For this reason we have to make efforts to see and gather our awareness in how the world actually is. We have to be able to see this and then at the exact moment when it will be appropriate to someone to teach it just as it is. It cannot be with too many explanations. The Dharma is not about limiting and binding people. It’s not about forcing them to follow some Dharma rules but about becoming that huge mind of truth which the Dharma is.</p><p class="P1">The Dharma does not disappear at night time. Our pillow gets moved around from where it usually is and our hands find it all by themselves and put it in the right place. Yet the daytime, our hands can get idle. There is no Dharma only at daytime or nighttime. We have the, there is no name in the Dharma. In the Dharma there is no such thing as a man or a woman, something which is tall, something which is short. The same is with the Dharma in there is not differentiations. We can train our body but if we don’t know the Dharma we don’t know the Dharma. A baby throws up poison food and spits out stone that he puts in his mouth. The path is in this way the natural way. </p><p class="P1">We don’t offer things to others thinking about how we have given this here and given that there and how much we’ve given. Nor do we regret after we’ve given things if we are coming from the Dharma. If it is necessary then we give it. </p><p class="P2">1.13.“He is neither vision, nor hearing, nor perceiving, nor knowing; he transcends the host of fetters. He is equivalent to the various types of wisdom and identical to sentient beings. He is without discrimination with regard to the dharmas. </p><p class="P1">There is a koan that says the well-behaved monk does not enter nirvana. The badly behaved monk does not go to hell[see Entangling Vines (26)]. The person who does much terrible things to others does not need to go to hell, he will suffer himself. There is no need to be going into a hell for a person who behaves that way because the way they are living is hell itself. </p><p class="P1">Not getting angry, not enduring, not trying to make efforts, not not making efforts because all of it is in the Dharma. As the Master Bankei has said, all of it is unborn mind. Our dualistic mind explodes. We have to review our behavior and see ourselves honestly. And this ego is what is judging us in all of this. It is not the Buddha. We are seeing ourselves and becoming ourselves in that way. </p><p class="P2">1.14.“He is entirely without failing, without impurity, without vexation, without intentionality (lit., “unconstructed”), without activation, without generation, and without extinction; without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without dislike, and without attachment; without past, without future, and without present. He cannot be discriminated or manifested using any verbal explanations at all. </p><p class="P1">As Master Dogen says, “To work hard in every single day is of the greatest value.”  To not make efforts in every single day you’ll be regretting that for hundreds of years. There’s no equilibrium in that. But when there is no equilibrium in our mind it is because we are doing that. But when we are in Dharma, even when we are angry and even if we are not angry and even if we make efforts and even if we do not make efforts we can see clearly how all of that is. </p><p class="P1">It is not the Dharma that gets confused but when we sit we come to know that Dharma that is not confused. Even if there is confusion, it is not coming from Dharma. Our standards are from the way we think dualistically. The Dharma forms our way of seeing and that does not come from dualism then. The Dharma is therefore very close to us. The Dharma has no form so a person who is without integrity and lies is not doing that with anything to do from the Dharma. </p><p class="P1">As when Manjusri comes in and Vimalakirti says to him, “Manjusri, when you come in, there is no coming and when you leave there is no going.”  </p><p class="P1">There’s no dualism in the coming and going. Dualism such as coming and going in the Dharma. It is not about that. Just as Master Rinzai has said, “In this five foot lump of red flesh, there is a true person of no rank always coming in and going out.”  Everyone has this going in and going out all of our orifices. But it comes from an external personal view and if it is from the Dharma then there is no sense of being any coming and going. </p><p class="P1">When this which is in this five foot lump of red flesh, always coming in and out, when it comes out it becomes from our ears, the bird song, bells ringing, the rain drop dropping. It is always working to every corner of the whole universe. Yet it is not the Dharma that is making our feet move. The Dharma is not going in and not coming in. To not be mistaken about this but to see this hugeness of the Dharma and how we are not being controlled by that if we are in delusion and confusion. If we are in the Dharma, then everything comes right to us. But this is up to each of us. </p><p class="P1">We have used many words, but they don’t cover the Dharma’s description. And so Vimalakirti said nothing finally at the end when Manjusri came to visit him when was asked in the Chapter on the Mysterious Way of the Not-two. We have that way also of Master Joshu. A monk asked Master Joshu, “Does a dog have Buddha nature?”  Master Joshu answered, “Mu.”  That mu is not about anything conceptual. </p><p class="P1">To become that Mu to become it in every single thing you do we bring that Mu into one pressurized focus, into a single point. This is a way of teaching in Zen, which is not about looking around for some Buddha somewhere, but putting that dualistic mind to bed. And then to give everything we have, to becoming like a balloon, which is getting fuller and fuller and fuller from our deep taut fullness and just ready to burst with one pin prick. If we don’t let our energy leak out or give away everything to overly being concerned for our body or other things that are external. We have to give that energy and that tension to every single bit of our focus and then we become a state of mind that can extend to every corner of the zendo, every corner of the universe. This is the truth of the teaching of Zen. </p><p class="P1">It’s not about a dualistic small perception about surging forth, it is actually surging forth from within. As Mumon Ekai has taught, with every single one of the 360 smallest bones, 84,000 hair pores, we burn in every part of us in our body and being for this mu. We let go of all ideas of anything that is nihilistic or about having or gaining something. And in all of the 24 hours of the day we continue as if we have a red hot burning iron ball in our mouth that we cannot spit out and we cannot swallow down. </p><p class="P1">We continue, we continue, we let go of all of our attachments, all of our conditioning, all of our ideas about things. We let go so completely we become like a person who is mute but has had a dream but they can’t tell it because they can’t speak. Again and again we continue letting go of everything and when we first begin, it is like a dark blackness inside. But becoming it totally fully taut transparent state of mind we realize that place where there is no longer any division between inside and outside piercing through the whole universe. Drinking down the whole universe. Yet that still has to be broken through completely until that balloon pops. </p><p class="P1">Master Kyogan discovered this only when he was hearing the sound of the bamboo hitting the tile. For the Buddha it was the sight of the morning star. And for Reiun it was the seeing of the peach blossoms blooming. A new birth of consciousness took place. As we see the mountain and rivers and flowers all of it as new as if we have never seen it before. Zen is not an explanation, it is an experience, it is that deep awareness encountering everything with no before and no after. And it is the truth which is why we come to zazen in the first place. These efforts made so totally we must not be afraid and not give our attention away to anything else. How much can we keep going at it?  How can we perceive it as deeply as it is?  Then we can encounter a great rebirth and in this way we can meet in that the true Buddha.</p><p class="P1">We sit sesshin to experience that true nature beyond any idea, beyond any form. Today is the seventh day of this osesshin, so has everyone realized the truth, which is moved around by nothing at all?  If you have realized this then when we all have to say goodbye to this physical body, you will not be deceived by anything. And if we realize the true nature then we know beyond a shadow of a doubt where we will be going. But if we are still moved around by the physical body, we are still going to stay insecure. To realize this true nature, that is Zen and that is Buddhism. Vimalakirti is now answering the Buddha when he asks, “What is it they were wanting to see?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti that the Buddha taught that each and everyone with their particular responsibility and work in society, each one also has to hold important being a abundant person who is like a flourishing rice field that brings benefits forth for everyone. At the early years of the Buddha, he was questioned and challenged when he was doing takuhatsu, alms gathering, by some other people who were practicing but also doing their own agricultural work. </p><p class="P1">They approached him and said, “We raise our own food and we deepen our mind, but you are doing no work at all, asking others for food for alms, isn’t that depending on those in society?  Can you call that an example of a way of people living in truth?”  And to this the Buddha answered, “I work hard on the fields as well.”  And they challenged him, “You don’t ever use an ox. You’re never seen leading a horse.”  The Buddha answered, “I’m working on the fields of Buddhanature so each and every person can harvest and work on these as well.”  In this way, he answered them.</p><p class="P1">But they thought it was a very uncomfortable answer, insufficient. For those asking, they could not see this as true farming. But today people do not live in the same old fashioned long hours of farming. But instead of abundant material things to use. No needing to work long hours on their agricultural needs. 6 or 7 hours a day at work perhaps. But is this really a solution?  Is anyone less anxious and less insecure for this difference?  We have more time but do we spend any of it on deepening our state of mind?  Seeing more clearly?  People all over the place who try to tempt people with all their free time into various things. But are we any better off?  Aren’t we worse off than we were in those days of common agriculture?  </p><p class="P1">The world is like a wild field that has gone to seed. It has been left untouched so only desire and anger and complaining come forth. As the Buddha said, each person has to cultivate their own mind’s depth. No matter how much we seek physical pleasure, we can never exhaust that appetite, only wanting more and more and more. Rather not to be stuck on a small narrow self’s need but to see the whole huge world and then take in all of the past, present and future in this huge vision of mind. To be plowing the wild field and cultivating it. Not only that which feeds our small personal needs but with all in society to cultivate and enjoy the products together. Planting seeds, plowing the field, mutually reaping the harvest. If we can see this we can see the material things are not the only thing. And if we make these kinds of efforts, we even don’t even know that we’re making efforts. That’s what it means to plow these fields and yet not plow them. Making fields and not even knowing it. In this way Vimalakirti answers.</p><p class="P2">1.14.“He cannot be discriminated or manifested using any verbal explanations at all.” </p><p class="P1">When Daruma Daishi was asked by the Emperor Wu, what is the ultimate truth, he answered, “Only emptiness. No holiness.”  Master Emperor Wu had bragged all about how many things he had done for Buddhism in China, that he had ordained so many monks, translated so many sutras, built so many temples. And he asked Daruma Daishi, “What would be all the merit he could accrue from having done all of those things.”  To which Daruma Daishi answered, “No merit.”  </p><p class="P1">Teaching that to have no idea of having done anything so good is the greatest offering. But it doesn’t mean to not do anything. But to do what we do empty mindedly. We cannot grasp after a deeper state of mind because it has no form. Neither can we live attached to desires and attachments. If we get moved around by things, then we have an attachment. If we are hungry we have to eat. In the cold weather we need some clothes, need a place to live to keep out the extreme weather. But while food clothing and housing are necessary, not to go beyond what is basically necessary, eating enough to stay alive should keep us healthy, and clothes enough that we don’t suffer. And our housing to keep out the extreme hot and cold. And if beyond that we have more time, and to use it on working to deepen our profound mind. </p><p class="P1">Master Rinzai said that the true Dharma has no form and extends throughout the ten directions. For the very most huge huge way of seeing the very most microscopic small way of seeing, our awareness stretches. It is truly huge. This is the activity of our mind, the span of it. The Buddha, the size of the whole universe and returning then down to its root source. </p><p class="P1">Great indeed is the mind. Heaven’s height is immeasurable, yet the mind rises above Heavens. The Earth’s depth is unfathomable. But mind reaches below the Earth. The light of the sun and moon cannot be out distanced. Yet mind passes beyond the light of the sun and moon. The universe is limitless. Yet mind travels beyond the universe. Though referred to as space or the primal energy that gives arise to myriad existence, it is mind that encompasses space and generates primal energy. </p><p class="P1">Because of it the sky shelters from above and the Earth supports from below. Because of it the sun and moon rotate. The four seasons change and all things are generated. Great indeed is mind. This huge mind which is not yet exhaustively investigated, externally as well, we have researched and still the mind is so incomprehensible, so unknown about, the construction of it, the laws of it. More and more we can investigate what the eyes cannot see but still it cannot be measured, seen, heard or can we say that we know what it is. And this is the Buddha.</p><p class="P2"> “World-honored One, such is the body of the Tathāgata, and thus do I perform its contemplation. To use this contemplation is called the correct contemplation. If [one uses some] other contemplation, this is called the incorrect contemplation.” </p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti teaches from all positions the various ways of seeing this. And saying that we’ve seen so much, this we cannot say however, that we have seen the Buddha. Only by experiencing this can we truly know it. And that is Zen. Not the imagination expansiveness but the experiencing of it. Our ego view is not formed at birth but later from data, experiences, memory. At our beginning there was only cells, we begin to get subjective about those cells. “Are you calling me a fool?”  And we start to think of ourselves as a conceptual invention of an ego.  We think that’s who we are. </p><p class="P1">But there is something more important than this and that is what we all are in common or else someone mistakes pulling the switch on the plutonium bomb, which is ever possible. So we ask, what is the Buddha?  Our experience and knowledge is important but if we get attached to that that is not the point. We have to set that, our personal experience and knowledge aside and see what is the truth for all people. That which is prior to one.  That is a zero. Before we held onto anything that is the zero, but so what comes, what’s the point of understanding zero or mu. But if we can realize that we can see things in a larger picture and that is our responsibility. And this is what is most necessary in today’s modern world, not to be just really having an idea about a picture of a pastimes Buddha or paradises. But to realize what has created all of those. Their deepest source. And from a valid position, not one of our ego but from the truth. And not from not for the point of fulfilling our ego desires but for the truth. To objectively clearly and truly see this. </p><p class="P1">The world needs, for world peace, we have to pull it together. Putting it simply it could all end with a great big bomb. But many situations are getting closer and closer to becoming explosive in that way. So we have to see with clarity our true mutual nature. As Master Joshu expressed it as mu, to see the whole entire view, this is mu, without using a lot of words, we have to receive and allow everything. Not caught on our own personal small narrow point of view, but to be flexible and huge in mind and asking what is the truth to realize it directly.</p><p class="P1">Roshi has friend named Edi-san? (1:19:29.4) in Kyoto who carves wooden Buddhas.  They have to be able to stay in, they have to be able to, after they are carved, to stay untwisted for a thousand years, these pieces of wood. He finds a simple piece of wood and looks at its twists and its irregular places. To see what Buddha is held in there. This is the deep secret of the carver of the wooden Buddha. Not just any tree will do but one with many twists and turns and irregularities in the wood. If it is attempted to carve this in one chunk it will break and crack so this tall tree is cut into four quarters and cut and shaped and then allowed to be as it is to its fullest twisting. It twists as much as it can possibly twist. Twisting twist to its own settled place. Hundreds of pieces of wood are there in his workshop in process. No heating and no cooling. All kinds of trees. </p><p class="P1">And this is very similar to training. How many different kinds of people come, extremely egoistic people, people with very little motivation, people who are particularly intuitive. All kinds of people. To see each one’s character closely and not being in a hurry but to slowly allow the twists and carve away. </p><p class="P1">We have to have patience and see very carefully with that great big mind and this requires perseverance. But if we don’t have that, we will not be able to cultivate those which are going to be for the eyes for others and for us to also be able, by this cultivation, to see ourselves. And in this way, to cultivate, and with each person’s way of being, to cultivate their potential for working in society.</p><p class="P1">Here we are 50 people together. Each person has an important work and position and responsibility in the world but for each of us to get our view into alignment here, working on it. These is a very important opportunity for what is happening in a world full of only profit and benefit. People to come here, where we may hurt in our legs and our bodies, but we continue to align and align, never knowing if there is any meaning to what we are doing, wondering if there is any meaning to this, but our vow to go beyond profit, to go beyond our small self benefit, to lead others in society in this way also. This little by little will change things. </p><p class="P1">We have to cultivate this true view which is not lopsided. Our way of seeing life, seeing the world has to be accurate and true. And not for our own children only but for all the descendants and it can’t even end there. What will we be leaving for them?  To teach this truth of the Buddha, he thinks this must be everybody’s vow.</p><p class="P2">2. Śāriputra then asked Vimalakīrti, “Where did you die to become born here?”</p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “Are there death and birth in the dharmas as you apprehend (lit., “attain”) them?” </p><p class="P2">Śāriputra said, “There are no death and birth [in the dharmas].” </p><p class="P2">[Vimalakīrti said,] “If the dharmas are without the characteristics of death and birth, why do you ask ‘Where did you die to become born here?’ What do you mean? It is as if a magician conjures up a man and a woman— do they die and become born?” </p><p class="P1">All of the disciples of the Buddha, the great disciples, all of their wisdom together would have been only one sixteenth of the wisdom, of the great wisdom of Sariputra. And yet in this sutra he is often turned into the bad guy. Here, he is asking slightly flatteringly, in what world had Vimalakirti lived before, what great world, because his wisdom was so great and it continues. </p><p class="P1">In making this clear the way it is spoken about how there is no birth and death in the Heart Sutra, and how there is nothing missing and nothing extra. To see that there is no birth nor death, nothing extra, nothing missing, that wisdom is not something which comes and goes, this given teaching is then held up to Sariputra is why doesn’t he get it that if this is true, how could Vimalakirti be coming and going from another realm. Again Sariputra is put down.</p><p class="P1">If you know that how can you ask me from where I came last life?  As if all phenomena are something real. The four seasons changing and their appearances. They appear to be in flux, but from the source, from true nature there is no such dynamics as the flux and changing of four seasons. All of that is all description of the world of phenomena. Not to ask of someone where he came from or is going. Sariputra, that only shows the lack of true wisdom and actual deep awakening which you have.</p><p class="P2">[Vimalakīrti said,] “If the dharmas are without the characteristics of death and birth, why do you ask ‘Where did you die to become born here?’ What do you mean? It is as if a magician conjures up a man and a woman— do they die and become born?” </p><p class="P2">Śāriputra said, “They do not die and become born.” </p><p class="P2">[Vimalakīrti said,] “But can you not have heard the Buddha explain that the dharmas are like conjured characteristics?” </p><p class="P2">[Śāriputra said,] “So I have.” </p><p class="P2">[Vimalakīrti said,] “If all the dharmas are like conjured characteristics, why do you ask ‘Where did you die to become born here?’ Śāriputra, death is the characteristic of the destruction of false dharmas, and birth is the characteristic of continuity of false dharmas. Although bodhisattvas die, they do not exhaust their roots of goodness, and although they are born they do not nurture the various evils.” </p><p class="P1">When we see a movie we are only seeing it as real while we watch it. When it is over we don’t think the things in the movie are continuing going on and are real and actual somewhere. And this is the same with everything in our environment and with our bodies as well. But instead of seeing this clearly as it really is, we put down that person, we get bothered by this person, we can’t stand having to see this person. Yet while we know all of it is phenomena we also still have to hold each person and meeting precious and know that it is a rare occasion. </p><p class="P1">On knowing that, this is all phenomena at the same thing, at the same time, not thinking that each and everything is worthless because it’s phenomena. Not holding on to attached feelings about this phenomena either. But that would be the same as being attached to things in a movie. In a movie, many scenes happen but nobody in the movie is really dying. They just got shot. And this is how it has to be seen. </p><p class="P1">As we have heard in the Diamond Sutra and as the Sixth Patriarch has written:</p><p class="P3">Thus shall ye think of all this fleeting world,<br/>A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, <br/>A flash of lightening in a summer cloud, <br/>A flickering lamp, <br/>A phantom, and a dream.</p><p class="P4"><span class="semiBoldItalic"/></p><p class="P1">We know this yet we have human feelings naturally and also want a good future and so we work in that for the better way of doing all things. But this is how the Buddha said it very clearly, “Thus shall ye think of all this fleeting world.  A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flash of lightening in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.” </p><p class="P1">We still have to see even with in knowing this, the rarity and preciousness of each and every moment, thing and person. Iit is all a phenomena as Vimalakirti is saying to Sariputra, however, this phantasmagorical appearance continues for awhile. But there is no such thing going on, it is all a bubble and a dream. And in that there neither is any such serious thing as birth and death. Just a karmic affiliation that lasts for awhile but our emotions are so strong so we can’t see it as only being a phenomena. Neither should we see as a phenomena which is meaningless, but to not become attached to it, that is wisdom. </p><p class="P1">Life is short but art lasts a long time is one it is said. Life is short but academics last a long time. Even though our life may be brief, art and knowledge that we bring forth and have created, stay to be used by and known by others. It is borrowed form only and yet it is still precious. Like a child who died when he was young, we don’t belittle that, we grieve for his potential even though it is a child who was young and died. We don’t just say that anyway it was a phenomena so why does it matter. </p><p class="P1">It’s not about it being put down that it is a phenomen. It is about seeing the wisdom of that. That phenomena in every situation. Otherwise it is not a wise perception that just because it is a phenomena it has no point to it or no purpose to it. That is not how we can see this in the wisest way. But to see it as a whole picture of how that entire picture is the phenomena. And not to be caught either on the appearance of birth and death. Vimalakirti is saying these things through Sariputra, to Sariputra, in order for them to reach the ears and the understanding of all those listening. </p><p class="P2">3. Then the Buddha told Śāriputra, “There is a country called Wondrous Joy (Abhirati), where the Buddha is entitled Akṣobhya (Immovable). Vimalakīrti died in that country prior to being born here.” </p><p class="P2">Śāriputra said, “This is unprecedented! World-honored One, this person is able to forsake a pure land and come take pleasure in this place of great anger and harm.” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “What do you think? When the sun’s light appears, is it conjoined with darkness?” </p><p class="P2">[Śāriputra] answered, “No. When the sun’s light appears, the darkness disappears.” </p><p class="P2"> Vimalakīrti said, “Why does the sun come to Jambudvīpa?” [Śāriputra] answered, “To illuminate it and eliminate the darkness.” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas are like this. Even though they are born in impure buddha lands in order to convert sentient beings, they are not therefore conjoined with the darkness of stupidity. They merely extinguish the darkness of the afflictions of sentient beings.” </p><p class="P1">Bodhisattvas come into this world because of people’s great misery, insecurity and pain, and bodhisattvas come here to take away that pain and suffering. Where there is wisdom there is no pain and suffering, there is only Buddha nature and Buddha nature allows us to see that from the origin there has never been suffering. The darkness goes  with the rising sun. When there is a person of wisdom then everyone is able to purify their mind and people are no longer deceived by their ideas of suffering.  Bodhisattvas enter the world to bring wisdom and purification everywhere.</p><p class="P2">4. At this time the great congregation eagerly wished to see the Wondrous Joy world, Akṣobhya Tathāgata, and his congregations of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.</p><p class="P2">Knowing what the entire assembly was thinking, [the Buddha] told Vimalakīrti, “Good man, on behalf of this assembly, manifest Wondrous Joy world, Akṣobhya Tathāgata, and his congregations of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. The congregations all wish to see them.” </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti then thought to himself, “Without getting up from my seat I should lift the Wondrous Joy world, including its Iron Ring Mountains; streams, rivers, oceans, springs; [Mount] Sumeru and the other mountains; the sun, moon, and stars; the palaces of the gods, dragons, demonic spirits, and Brahmā gods; its congregations of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas; the cities, towns, villages, men and women, adults and children; and even Akṣobhya Tathāgata with the bodhi tree and its wondrous lotus flowers, which are able to perform the Buddha’s work throughout the ten directions. There are three jeweled stairways from Jambudvīpa to the Tuṣita Heaven, and the gods descend these jeweled stairways. They all worship Akṣobhya Tathāgata and listen to his Dharma. The people of Jambudvīpa also climb those stairways, ascending to Tuṣita to see the gods there. </p><p class="P2">5. Thinking this thought, [Vimalakīrti] entered samādhi and manifested the power of numinous transformation. With his right hand he grasped the Wondrous Joy world and placed it in this land. </p><p class="P2">6. Those congregations of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas [in that Wondrous Joy world], as well as the other gods and humans who had attained numinous penetration, all said, “O World-honored One, who is taking us away? Please save us!” </p><p class="P2">Akṣobhya Buddha said, “This is not my doing. This is being done through the numinous power of Vimalakīrti. </p><p class="P2">The others, who had not attained numinous penetration, were unaware of where they were going. </p><p class="P2">Although the Wondrous Joy world entered this land, it did not expand or contract. At this the [sahā] world was not constricted, but unchanged from before. </p><p class="P2">7. At this point Śākyamuni Buddha told the great congregations, “You may view the Wondrous Joy world, Akṣobhya Tathāgata, and the ornamentations of that country, and the pure practices of the bodhisattvas and purity of the disciples.” </p><p class="P2">They all said, “Yes, we see them.” </p><p class="P2">The Buddha said, “Bodhisattvas who wish to attain pure buddha lands such as this should learn the path that has been practiced by Akṣobhya Tathāgata.” </p><p class="P2">When this Wondrous Joy world was manifested, fourteen nayutas of people in the sahā world generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, all wishing to be born in the Wondrous Joy buddha land. Śākyamuni Buddha predicted for them, saying, “You will be born in that country.” </p><p class="P2">Then the benefits in response of having the Wondrous Joy world in this country were finished, and it returned to its original place, as seen by the entire congregation. </p><p class="P2">8. The Buddha told Śāriputra, “Did you see this Wondrous Joy world and Akṣobhya Buddha?” </p><p class="P2">[Śāriputra said,] “Yes, I saw them. World-honored One, I wish that every sentient being could attain a pure land like that of Akṣobhya Buddha and obtain the power of numinous penetration like Vimalakīrti. </p><p class="P1">Then the Buddha said that in accordance with Vimalakirti’s miraculous powers, those who want to be reborn in this realm will be if they made efforts since they are all already endowed with bodhisattva mind. If we make a true vow and make genuine efforts, then our vow will clearly be fulfilled in our future.</p><p class="P1">If we want to know a person’s past, look at them now. If we want to know a person’s future, look at them now. You see their vow in the present moment, only this moment is what is. It is not found speculating on what happened in the past and will be in the future. If we want to grow a healthy plant with a wonderful flower  we have to nuture strong roots, feed and care for it well, and its blooming will be assured. The Buddha’s teaching is not about praying for greatness in a future life, instead walk firmly on the ground underneath our feet in this very moment. We will see that mindfully living our daily life opens this very world. Live now, fully, in the present. </p><p class="P2">“World-honored One, we have quickly attained good benefit, seeing these people and making offerings directly to them. Those sentient beings who hear this sutra, either now [while you are] present or after the Buddha’s nirvana, will also attain good benefit. How much more so if, after hearing it, they devoutly understand, accept, recite, explain, and practice according to it! </p><p class="P2">9. “Those who get hold of this sutra will attain the [entire] storehouse (i.e., treasury) of the Dharma jewel.</p><p class="P2"> “If one reads, recites, explains its meaning, or practices according to its explanation, one will be protected and remembered by the buddhas. To make offerings to such a person—understand that this is to make offerings to the Buddha. To copy and maintain these fascicles of scripture—understand that the Tathāgata is present in that room. Those who hear this sutra and are able to become joyful accordingly will achieve omniscience. If one is able to devoutly understand this sutra, even just a single four-phrase verse ( gāthā), and explain it to others—understand that such people will immediately receive a prediction of [their future achievement of] anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.” </p><p class="P1">A central issue of this sutra is taught by Vimalakirti when visited on his sick bed and asked what he was going through, he said, “I am not sick but I am sick because society is sick so I have become sick. I will only recover when society recovers.”  Without this understanding this interpenetration, we cannot work in the world. It’s not about teaching a doctrine of Buddhism to people, rather help them see how we have lost touch with our innate nature. Help people in the world directly perceive their sickness and help people see their deep wisdom with clarity. Directly realizing the dharma in this moment is the way of the truth. </p><p class="P1">The Vimalakirti Sutra is not given to us so we can spend our time on interpretations but to guide us how to live. In this world we make continuous efforts to bring an end to all suffering of all beings. This is the greatest offering to the Buddha, these are the Four Immeasurable Treasures. Keep this sutra close, readily at hand, use it, and the Buddha will be living in the same room. </p><p class="Standard">Someone who can feel this sutra deeply can open their path widely and be at one with all society, becoming like a mirror simply reflecting exactly what comes in front of us. Not moved around by the constantly changing reflections, being joyful or sad with others, yet not drowning in sentiments and opinions. If we realize this path taught in the Vimalakirti sutra,  if we realize this Samadhi offered by Vimalakirti,  then the way to liberate others will manifest spontaneously. </p></body></html>
