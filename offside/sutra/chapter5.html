At this point the Buddha addressed Mañjusri, “You go inquire about Vimalakirti’s illness.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, that superior one is difficult to respond to.</p><p class="P1">“He has profoundly attained the true characteristic, and he is good at explaining the essentials of the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">“His eloquence is unhampered, and his wisdom is unhindered.</p><p class="P1">“He completely understands all the deportments of the Bodhisattvas, and he has entered into all the secret storehouses of the buddhas.</p><p class="P1">“He has subjugated the host of Maras, and disports himself in the numinous penetrations. He has already attained perfection in his wisdom and skillful means.</p><p class="P1">“Nevertheless, I will accept your sagely purport and proceed to inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P4">With the visit of Manjusri to Vimalakirti we are at the truth teaching chapters of the sutra, this is the main part of the story of Vimalakirti. The central nugget is the following chapter on non-duality. This chapter on Manjusri prepares us for the main chapter on non-duality. Even though the Buddha had requested it, none of the disciples felt like they were able to call on Vimalakirti, having been reprimanded and cautioned by him in previous encounters. They had all been cautioned by him on various things and felt they were not good enough to meet him again. So next the Buddha asks Manjusri bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">Manjusri answers, ‘If you tell me to go, it isn’t that I refuse, but he is so deep, so abundant, so brilliant, I cannot be an appropriate match. He is always in realization of the truth. And no matter who he speaks to, he knows the answer on enlightenment with his experience and magnanimous, deep wisdom. There is no one but the Buddha who can speak like that. Vimalakirti can also see through to the center, the very essence, of whomever comes along. Vimalakirti’s body, his mind and his mouth are all free from any karmic impurities. He speaks so eloquently, his mind is pure, he understands clearly, and no matter how another person comes to him, he immediately comprehends and appropriately answers, having seen them deeply, clearly and accurately. He freely and immediately responds from truth. I cannot speak with him equally, but with the Buddha’s grace, I will go’. In this way, Manjusri departed to go see Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P1">2. Thereupon the Bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indras, Brahmas, and the four heavenly kings in the assembly all thought, “Now these two great Bodhisattvas Mañjusri and Vimalakirti will have a discussion. They will certainly explain a wondrous Dharma.”</p><p class="P1">At the time eight thousand Bodhisattvas, five hundred Sravakas, and a hundred thousand gods all wanted to follow along. Mañjusri and the congregation of Bodhisattvas and great disciples, with the gods reverentially surrounding them, then entered the great city of Vaisali.</p><p class="P4">When they heard that Manjusri and Vimalakirti would be meeting, all of the same disciples and bodhisattvas who had refused to go in the first place, knew that there would be a great teaching and that they had to go. The eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, a hundred thousand gods and goddesses gathered, and they all went together with Manjusri.</p><p class="P1">3. At that time the Elder Vimalakirti thought, “Now Mañjusri and a great congregation is coming.”</p><p class="P1">Then with his numinous power he emptied out his room, removing what was there as well as his servants. He left only a single couch, upon which he reclined in his illness.</p><p class="P4">In this way, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, and a hundred thousand gods and goddesses all came with Manjusri to see Vimalakirti, and with his supernatural powers, Vimalakirti saw them all coming. He made it so that his room only had one bed in it, and there he rested quietly.</p><p class="P4">This empty room of Vimalakirti is said to be the source of the tea room, tea ceremony and the tea house. This way of tea ceremony, with its spare hermitage-like tea room and simple garden was begun by Tea Master <span class="indexTerm">Rikyu</span>. He did long years of zazen practice, and from the deep power of his vow he taught that the first priority in the training of tea is to intimately study the Dharma. He taught this himself and he was always creating a context of how it is in the zendo, and also that the tea garden should maintain the simplicity of a Zen temple garden.</p><p class="P4">This is Rikyu’s own way of teaching, and it was this very hut of Vimalakirti which was the model for Rikyu’s teahouse. When Vimalakirti took everything out of his house, leaving only one bed where he lay, this way of being is a way of expressing one’s own life. The tearoom is usually the size of four and one-half tatami mats, and outside of the tea room there is a small simple garden. The four and one-half mat room is the size taken from the Vimalakirti Sutra; the small simple garden comes from the teaching in the Lotus Sutra. The room in which Vimalakirti lived was a square, four and one-half tatami sized room, and this is the same as the word for a head priest of a temple. It is a little larger than nine feet square, with the addition of the tokonoma and a wooden board.</p><p class="P4">One Buddha land. Buddha lands are not about space, but about being one complete world, three meters square. In the case of the tea room, we purify our senses before entering it, rinse our mouths, and put away our worldly thoughts and ideas. We enter the room with a quiet focused mind. Usually, about three or four people can fit into a tea room comfortably. But if there are no mental, dualistic ideas to restrict and make it narrow, it is not difficult for a three meter square tea room to hold eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, and one hundred thousand gods and goddesses. </p><p class="P4">We can all enter if we think about it. Rationally it may seem impossible. But since it is the whole great space in that room, it is an infinite size—a world like Mount Sumeru. Mount Sumeru, the huge mountain, could be likened unto the Himalayas, surrounded by four lands, which are then surrounded by eight oceans, and they all fit into a poppy seed. In our head, if we try to understand this, it is not possible. But to go beyond that is what we have to do to see the depth of the truth of Buddhism. And what is our zazen for? To become that truth. To become that truth of how we are the entire zendo. How we are stretching from one corner to the furthest corner of the whole universe. Fifty-five people may seem like many in one zendo. And yet the space is one person’s truth. This is zazen.</p><p class="P4">If we are blaming this person for that and disliking that person for this, we are lingering in the world of dualistic thinking, bringing in extraneous thoughts, and that is not zazen.</p><p class="P4">As the Buddha said, let go of all of those thoughts and become that state of mind of the heavens and earth. Every single person and every single event in all the three realms are my children and responsibility. Every single place in those three realms is my home. Not just humans but all existences. This comes from true experiences of actually seeing and knowing. Through this we can see how huge is this three meter by three meter room. When we can with this physical eye that is only a few millimeters wide see the entire world, it is not so strange, is it, that this small room could then hold eight thousand bottisattvas, five hundred disciples, and one hundred thousand gods and goddesses!</p><p class="P4">Manjusri went with many disciples and heavenly beings to visit Vimalakirti. In his house, in his small room, there was not one single thing, only Vimalakirti resting alone. There was incense burning and he was waiting for the guests. This is the tearoom. No matter what wonderful tea utensils there are, they are put away and only a single flower is offered to the Buddha. Incense is also offered and nothing else is in the room. This is the rule for the host, to create a room where no random thoughts can enter. It is the clear mind of the host that prepares this room.</p><p class="P4">At the tearoom the guests first clean their hands at the tsukubai (rock basin with water in it) in the garden. They purify their mouth and they purify their mind. Then they enter the <span class="indexTerm">tearoom</span>. Rikyu has written, “The small garden is the path in from the floating transient world, don’t bring in the dust from the mists of that world.” In this way <span class="indexTerm">Rikyu</span> has written. When we enter the small tea garden we are no longer in that world of dualistic values of good and bad, win and lose. This is the world where everything is equal, a different world. The pure world of the Buddha is how we must receive it. From this comes the origin of the simple tea garden. Once we enter that garden’s world we put aside all thoughts from the everyday world. This is the purified mind of the guest.</p><p class="P4">Once we enter the tea room there are only the calligraphy scroll and the flowers to be seen, with the sound of the boiling teakettle, like wind in the pines. The wonderful fragrance of the incense greets our nose, and we taste the delicious tea. With these our mind and body are purified; this is the tea path of wabi and sabi. All of our six senses and their roots are purified; the qualities of harmony, respect, clarity and serenity are realized. The room of Vimalakirti inspired this way of tea. The room of Vimalakirti was pure and so was his heart and his mind; with this purity he received the representative from the Buddha, Manjusri bodhisattva. Manjusri did not add in the slightest thought; in accordance with the mind of the Buddha, he encountered Vimalakirti. With a truly clear and pure mind he arrived at the room of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P1">4. Mañjusri entered the house, and he saw the room was empty, with Vimalakirti lying alone on a single couch.</p><p class="P1">Then Vimalakirti said, “Welcome, Mañjusri. You have come with the characteristic of not coming; you see with the characteristic of not seeing.”</p><p class="P4">When Manjusri entered the room of Vimalakirti, it was empty except for one bed. The state of mind of satori was overflowing everywhere. “You did well to come, Manjusri, and even though you come, there is no coming. No sense of your having come. Nor is there any awareness in your mind of having arrived. Who appears is not to be seen.” When we visit someone and are wondering what to say, should I say this to them or should I say that to them, that is dualistic and delusive. But to have no thought, then everything is huge and natural. It is not about wondering in advance what kind of greetings to make. This is how Manjusri came, totally naturally, and how Vimalakirti perceived, welcomed and responded to him. This unattached way of seeing is the state of mind of satori.</p><p class="P4">As Hakuin Zenji has said, “Even those who have sat zazen only once will see all karma erased.” Bodhidharma said it very clearly: let go of everything that we are attached to externally and everything we connect to within; when we are sitting, forget we are even sitting, and our mind holds on to nothing whatsoever. To not be caught on a self nor on an other. The Sixth Patriarch said it this way: to everything that we perceive externally, we add no extra thoughts of whether it is good or it is bad. That is sitting, and Zen is to not cling to any of the concerns that are floating in our mind. This is samadhi. Samadhi is deep zazen power. When a mirror reflects, the mirror has no intention of what it is now going to reflect. Yet it also has no idea of itself as being empty. Things simply come, are reflected, and leave. So it is without receiving any image, which would then be a stain. This is samadhi. Samadhi is not holding on to anything. This being actualized is samadhi. And we choose sitting as a way to realize this.</p><p class="P4">“That natural, matter of course, state of mind is how you have come. You have come with a natural and innocent mind to visit;” this is how Vimalakirti welcomes Manjusri.</p><p class="P4">This is how it is for all of us. When someone comes to visit, we welcome them and tell them we are glad they came, “You’ve come such a long way in your busy life, thank you so much for coming!” The host always welcomes the arriving guest; this is regular courtesy. Nevertheless these were not the only words of Vimalakirti. These are words expressing clearly the way of the “Not two”, brilliantly revealed. “You are very welcome! There you are without any coming! You appear, without any seeing”.</p><p class="P4">He is saying that Manjusri came with a form of no coming and no seeing. He adds two negations; this is the empty-minded way, which is so hard to put into words. Our world of seeing and no seeing, of coming and no coming. That world of dualism which we are always living in—he puts that world aside.</p><p class="P4">It does not have to be so difficult. When we live in the world of the zendo and do zazen, then we align our minds all day long; we don’t wake up in the morning wondering if we should get up or not. A bell rings and we wake up accordingly, we go to the hondo not worrying and wondering if we should go there or not. If the hondo bell sounds, we follow the sangha and go there. We don’t get into thinking any idea of “shall I chant or not chant?” and we naturally sit zazen when the bell and clappers go. We don’t think about each moment of “now we enter zazen, now we finish zazen”.</p><p class="P4">When the dining room bell goes, we just follow the leading person into the dining room. Without any confusion we go to the hondo at the sound of the drum and to the kitchen at the bell and to samu when the clappers sound. We are not thinking about each activity, and in this way our True mind moves easily and freely. If we are not careful we might mistakenly think that the bell, the drum, and the clappers are using us.</p><p class="P4">Rather than always thinking about each and every thing we do, “Should I do this, Should I do that?”, as people so often do, this is much more empty-minded and free. Our state of mind is one of entrusting; there is nothing to be confused by, and our action is freely born from clear mind. Here we live the daily life of not two and this is what Vimalakirti meant when he said, “You are very welcome! There you are without any coming! You appear, without any seeing.”</p><p class="P4">This is the actualization, and one who has not walked this cannot manifest this expression. This is the manifestation of empty-mindedness.</p><p class="P4">Mañjusri said, “So it is, retired scholar. If one has come, there is no more coming. If one has gone, there is no more going. Why? To come is to come from nowhere; to go is to proceed nowhere. That which can be seen is then invisible.</p><p class="P4">This is saying about samadhi directly: There is no wondering here of, ‘now what should I say, how should I arrive’. And when it is over, there is no need to see it further or hold onto it. This is how Manjusri answered him. The words may seem difficult to understand intellectually, but in terms of our way of being what is said here is a matter of course.</p><p class="P4">Within <span class="indexTerm">Dogen</span> Zenji’s work, <span class="indexTerm"><span class="T1">Shobogenzo</span></span>, there is a chapter entitled  <span class="indexTerm"><span class="T1">Being-time</span></span><span class="indexTerm"> [Uji]</span>, in which Dogen writes about being and time. We see deeply within the context of being, what our life actually is. We dig to that point and then without fail we will come to the same place. To exist always relates to there being time. Existence and time cannot be separated; they are originally one and the same.</p><p class="P4">In our practical daily world we perceive time as something flowing by and around us, but this is a mental understanding and not the way it really is. Our life energy, just as it is, is time. We mentally understand time as being something that flows from a past through a present, on to a future. We also have a vow and a hope and plans that come to be, and this makes us see it as a future that then flows into a present then into a past. This opposite way of flow can also be seen, but these are all mental ideas of time and not the thing itself, not the living thing. We have to directly encounter that time which flows from now to now. From now to now, from now to now, from one now to the next now. Every instant it is born and transforms; this is time. This is our actuality of being alive.</p><p class="P4">In the <span class="indexTerm">Mumonkan</span> we have a case [<span class="indexTerm">Tõzan’s Sixty Blows (15)</span>] with Master Tõzan Shusho Zenji. When <span class="indexTerm">Tõzan</span> first came from his home country to meet the Master <span class="indexTerm">Unmon</span> he was a young 32 or 33 years old, and Master Unmon was already a well-ripened 88 or 89. Master Unmon and the monk Tõzan were like grandfather and grandson. Unmon Daishi asked him from where he had come and he answered,</p><p class="P2">“Yes, I came from Sado, Master”.</p><p class="P2">“And where were you residing during the last training period?” “At Konan at the temple of Hozuji.” </p><p class="P2">“When did you leave Hozuji?”</p><p class="P2">“ It was August 25th.”</p><p class="P2">Then Master Unmon said “I give you 60 blows with my stick!”</p><p class="P4">That night Tõzan could not sleep. All night long he thought and wondered why Unmon had done that, why did he have to hit him? Where was his mistake? He laid down but he couldn’t get to sleep and then it was dawn and he just couldn’t sit still, so he went to see Master Unmon one more time.</p><p class="P2">“You gave me 60 blows with your stick,but where was my mistake?” </p><p class="P2">Unmon’s answer was severe, “Have you been prowling around like that from Kozei to Konan with such a casual attitude?”</p><p class="P4">At this, Tõzan saw his gap-filled, distracted mind for the first time. For the first time he realized the mind which is not caught on externals and is free and alive.</p><p class="P4"><span class="indexTerm">Joshu</span> lived until 120, a very long life, and when he first met Master <span class="indexTerm">Nansen</span>, Joshu was only 19. Nansen was very tired that day after returning from cutting weeds at samu, and he was resting when Joshu came in. He asked Joshu from where he had come and Joshu answered, “Soshu no Zuizoin.”</p><p class="P4">Nansen asked him if he prayed well to the Jizo bodhisattva there and Joshu Jushin Osho answered without any hesitation, “No, I didn’t pray at Zuizo, but now I am paying my respects to a reclining Buddha.”</p><p class="P4">Nansen got up and asked him with whom he was now training, if he had a teacher. Joshu answered, “In this cold season, Teacher, please take good care of your health. Congratulations”, and he prostrated to him. Nansen was, on the contrary, gobbled up by Joshu. Joshu already had this advanced and excellent vow power and sharp sight, even at nineteen. This is very different from Tõzan’s first meeting with Unmon.</p><p class="P4">In the <span class="indexTerm">Surangama Sutra</span>, the Shuryo Gongyo, the Buddha teaches, “When unseeing, why do you not see the unseeing? If you see the unseeing, it is no longer unseeing.” [<span class="indexTerm">Blue Cliff Record</span>, <span class="indexTerm">The Surangama Scripture’s Not Seeing (94)</span>]. Of course these original words are from India, and they are translated roughly and are words that are hard to understand, but what is being said is this: does the world exist because I see it or do I see a world because it exists? If we say that a world exists because I exist, then it is solipsism. If we say that matter is the only reality, that is materialism, and if we say that the ultimate reality lies in consciousness, a realm transcending the material, that is idealism.</p><p class="P4">Zen is not materialism, nor is it idealism. That which is being seen and that which is seeing it are one, a perfectly matched whole. In this the actuality is manifested, the world, as it is, is me. The world is me, and I am the world. There is no separation between me and the world as is proposed by both idealism and materialism. The world and I are not separate; there is no such division. When I don’t see the world, where am I? When I see the world, where I am is clear, but if I don’t see it, then where am I? Where does the world go? If “I” don’t see the world, there is no “I”. This is the state of mind of zazen, the actuality, the world of Buddha nature, and this is Buddha nature and our original face.</p><p class="P4">In the Surangama Sutra the Buddha says, “When unseeing, why do you not see the unseeing”, meaning: when I enter samadhi, if you say you can see it, you are looking at something else, not my state of mind of samadhi. If you say you have seen something that is my samadhi, that is dualistic, so that is not my samadhi. That is only imagination and not the thing itself.</p><p class="P2">“If you do not see the unseeing, it is not an object.”</p><p class="P4">If you say you don’t see anything of my samadhi, with essence but not seeing, if you realize that state of mind, only then is it the world of not two. If you want to truly know my world of samadhi, then you have to become that state of mind as well. If you enter that state of mind where there is no self and no other present, then we are simultaneously in the same world. And if you don’t enter it in this way, then you cannot say that you have seen my samadhi.</p><p class="P4">“Why isn’t it yourself?” To say it a different way, this “world” and this “me”, that state of mind that does not get caught on either of these, is the Buddha nature. This is not something that you can announce as ‘This is Buddha nature’, because then it is only mental understanding. My samadhi state, where there is no self nor other, if you say you can see it, it is only an understanding about it, and not the thing itself. To know it directly, you have to enter samadhi too, and then there is no self, no person, no you, and nothing to be attached to at all. That is your true Buddha nature and essence, where there is no small you, where there is no world and no self. This place of no speck whatsoever remaining to be attached to: realize that completely, discover that. Because there is a “me” we think there is a “world”. Even if we see the actual living energy, because we see the phenomena and mistakenly think, “that is real”, we get seduced. To realize the place of no self and no world, this is the deepest truth of the entirely pure, entirely white ox under the blue sky.</p><p class="P4">The Sixth Patriarch said of this, “From the origin there is not a single thing”, there is no way to be deluded, even if we want to be. There is no one to be deluded. Realize this completely and totally. While seeing and encountering completely, to have no sense of the other’s form or existence whatsoever. To not be attached, yet to still be encountering. </p><p class="P4">This is not a mental understanding but to be meeting in the very midst of samadhi. This is what Vimalakirti was saying when he welcomed Manjusri.</p><p class="P4">This is zazen. If we are truly clear within, we can see exactly. It is not about wanting to return to the zendo when we are doing samu. As <span class="indexTerm">Dogen</span> Zenji has said, to go forth from yourself is delusion. To receive whatever comes to you, that is satori. If we are wandering around in our mind, that is not zazen. If someone comes and leaves, we don’t need to miss them on their departure. If we don’t add on imagination, our mind is naturally quiet and serene and imperturbable. When a mirror reflects, it does not consider and comment on what it is reflecting, it just reflects whatever comes to it, and then that leaves. To experience this state of mind is why we choose to sit zazen.</p><p class="P1">5. “But enough of this matter. Retired scholar, can this illness be forborn? In its treatment is it diminished, so as not to increase? The World-honored One has made immeasurable courteous inquiries about you.</p><p class="P1">6. “Retired scholar, what is the cause from which this illness arises? Has it been affecting you long? How will it be extinguished?”</p><p class="P4">So next, Manjusri decides to stop that line of conversation, and he asks how Vimalakirti is doing. Are you feeling bad? Not so bad? Are you in pain? The Buddha asked me to come, so I am here. Are you receiving any treatment, and is it getting better or is it getting worse? The Buddha is very concerned about your sickness. What sickness is it? What is the source of your sickness? You have been sick for a long time? It would be good if you would be improving. How is that looking? And in that way, on behalf of the request he had received from the Buddha, Manjusri very, very carefully and very meticulously asked after the health of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti said, “From stupidity there is affection, and hence the generation of my illness (or: the illness of self ). Since all sentient beings are ill, thereforeI am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished.</p><p class="P4">Actually, my sickness comes from ignorance, which craves love. Being concerned for this whole world’s pain and suffering, I have become sick myself.</p><p class="P4">Next we have the very famous words from this text: ‘Were all living beings to be free from sickness, I also would not be sick. I am not sick from my own physical sickness, but because all living beings are sick. Were all living beings to be free from sickness, I also would not be sick’.</p><p class="P4">Why?</p><p class="P4">For the bodhisattva, the world consists only of living beings, and sickness is inherent in living in the world. Were all living beings free of sickness, the bodhisattva would also be free of sickness. Because everyone is sick, seeing this, I also become sick. Of course, to become sick like that is not satori, but Buddhism is also not that cold-hearted. When small-self is gone, all of society becomes who I am. This is why the Buddha said that everything in the three realms, every place is my home, and all living beings in the three realms are my children. So it is a matter of course to be sick if there is no dualism. The concerns of people in this world are all my own concerns, and this is the way of the bodhisattva. We let go of everything to realize satori. But to sit down on that realization is not satori. It is deluded, but knowingly, we choose this delusion.</p><p class="P4">Everyone is concerned about people in society, not only Vimalakirti. But can we truly do it like Vimalakirti, with no conditions and no limits to what and who we are concerned about? Everyone cares about someone in society, but they are also very full of themselves in their concern, and therefore become calculating. This is the problem. Vimalakirti is one hundred percent concerned, without any conditions whatsoever. He is concerned about everyone in society. If we put fifty percent into it, and don’t put fifty percent into it, that is delusion. This is what the Vimalakirti Sutra is teaching us. This is the world of satori. Everyone cares about someone, and everyone is endowed with a base to realize satori. But, if your small-self still remains, it is still only delusion. Love for society, if it could not be thrown away, that still is a delusion, but this is a very important delusion. We cannot realize this and be like a fish who cannot live in absolutely clear, pure water. Even if we are awakened and realize satori, if we ignore society, it is a very small version of self-concern satori. We hear how important zazen is, and how we must do it with our life on the line completely.</p><p class="P1">Why? Bodhisattvas enter samsara on behalf of sentient beings. Because there is samsara, there is illness. If sentient beings were able to transcend illness, then Bodhisattvas would not also be ill.</p><p class="P1">7. “It is like an elder whose only son becomes ill, and the parents become ill as well. If the son recovers from the illness, the parents also recover. Bodhisattvas are like this. They have affection for sentient beings as if for their own children. When sentient beings are ill the Bodhisattvas are ill also, and when sentient beings recover from their illness the Bodhisattvas recover also.”</p><p class="P1">He also said, “From what cause does this illness arise? The illness of Bodhisattvas arises from great compassion.”</p><p class="P4">Manjusri bodhisattva says to Vimalakirti, ‘What is the source of your sickness?’ To this, Vimalakirti answers in this way, ‘Ignorance is the source of all sicknesses. That which comes from the lack of light, the deep darkness in our mind, from which wisps of ego come floating forth.’ They say that in a child, up until 16 months, doesn’t know the concept of one, and that at three years, a child has thoroughly understood the relative number of two, where they can conceive of what it means to have a good and a bad, or a me and a you. Humans’ dark, unawakened state of mind constructs an ego, and that ego has ignorance and then self-love. This self-love we have all experienced, being so thirsty on a hot day that we cannot stand it. We have to have some water. It is an instinct, this kind of self-love. But it doesn’t stay just an instinct. It becomes a craving, a desperate love. A love that must be satisfied, no matter what. And this even brings sickness to our organs.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti did not become sick like that, however. Rather, out of deep empathy for everyone else’s pain and suffering, he became sick like a parent becomes sick when their child becomes sick. Vimalakirti becomes sick because he loves society so much that he becomes the phenomena that they are experiencing right along with them. Because of desperate love this happens. It is because of this that the Vimalakirti is sick, because his love is so huge and great. If a child becomes better, then the child’s parents also feel better for that. Vimalakirti would get better when society gets better, but society’s sickness comes from the deep ignorance, that dark blackness from where ego and desperate, craving self-love all start. And since there is no end to the infinite, dark ignorance, Vimalakirti will stay sick.</p><p class="P4">For the bodhisattva, the world consists only of living beings, and sickness is inherent in living in the world. Were all living beings free of sickness, the bodhisattvas would also be free of sickness.</p><p class="P4">Bodhisattvas live in a world where the relative and the opposite are assumed,—where people believe that if you have a good, you must have a bad, if you have a gain, you must have a loss. If there is birth, then there is death. Actually, the truth is that there is only non-dualism. In that way, we do not have these opposites,where there is no difference between living and dying, coming and going. This is the truth when we are not caught on phenomena. If we get as big as the whole universe and look from there, there is no difference between coming and going. It is only as if we are in the living room, then we are in the kitchen, and then we are in the dining room. We just imagine we are in different places coming and going. From the origin, we are all awakened. Our eyes are wide open.</p><p class="P4">But we get caught on an idea that we are a small-self and become unable to believe we are a larger, all-embracing self, and from there we hold on to a relative and a dualistic deluded view. From the origin we have never been deluded and never held on to any ego. Bodhisattvas know this very well. Bodhisattvas, that means all of us. They know that this world is manifested because we are coming forth from greatest wisdom, truly full of love and compassion. And then from that ego’s manifestation comes forth that craving, desperate love. People of training who leave the world, who prefer to take a path where they leave the world to awaken themselves, they make their efforts to break through deeply. But they are not bodhisattvas because they live to resolve only their own delusive state of mind, while bodhisattvas live for all beings and for the resolution of all beings’ deepest delusion.</p><p class="P4">It is not about living in the deepest mountains and getting away from it all and retreating. It is about going into society where the people are so sick and in such pain. In society, if each and every person was liberated from craving desperate love, then the bodhisattvas would be liberated spontaneously, because they cannot be without concern for those that are in such pain. This is what a bodhisattva is. And this is what is being spoken of here as the source of the sickness. The pain of the world is my pain. This is the way of the bodhisattva. So I dive into it without fear, with deepest faith and great caring. And this is the way of the Mahayana.</p><p class="P4">Sometimes, if a child is sick, even both parents become sick as well. For the bodhisattvas, all people are their children. There is no separation from people at all. If they are sick, we can’t sit still. And this is the truth of the bodhisattva, who before liberating himself has vowed to liberate all other beings. He is never even thinking about his own awakening, only offering everything to all people. This is the truth of the way of the bodhisattva. There is a poem: ‘I am on this side of the water. I row people over to the other side. But if I get out of the boat, I have no work.’ This is why, of course, bodhisattvas also get sick.</p><p class="P4">Manjusri asks Vimalakirti how he got sick. Vimalakirti said it is because all beings are sick. This is not a cause of a sickness, but this is the karmic connection to sickness. It is that karmic connection which expresses our sickness. In the beginning, we are not karmically connected to sickness. Vimalakirti teaches he is not sick like others, but from his deep compassionate mind, which will do whatever can possibly be done to liberate others from their pain and their suffering. Most people are happy when they are in a state of mind of compassion, but for the bodhisattva it is that state of mind of compassion that is most essential and important.</p><p class="P4">In the olden days of Sogenji there was a monk at the time when the great master Gisan Zenrai Zenji was teaching at Sogenji. This monk had come from his father priest’s temple. Usually each monk who comes is sent by a father priest in a temple where they were before they came into a training monastery. This monk was training at Sogenji when he received a letter telling him how the temple from which he had been sent had burned down, and his father priest was asking him to take some time off and come and help put things back in order and rebuild the temple.</p><p class="P4">The monk read the letter. Then he took the letter and put it into the fire, underneath the rice-cooking pots where the wood was burning, and he burned that letter up. Another monk who was standing close by, a friend of his, said, ‘Your parent priest calls you back, and you are turning him down? I am longing for a letter telling me to come home! The food here is so little and so terrible! The training is so hard I can hardly stand it! I want nothing more than to go home. And you get a letter inviting you, and you burn it up. That is so impressive that you would do that.’ And the word got around. Everyone was talking about how this monk had burned up the letter from his parent priest to come home. And it finally reached the ears of the Roshi, <span class="indexTerm">Gisan Zenrai Zenji</span>. He called in the monk, and he said, ‘I hear that your home temple burned down, and you were sent a letter asking you to come and help your parent priest with the temple’s rebuilding, and you burned up that letter in the rice-cooking fire. Is this true?’ To this the monk answered, ‘Yes. If I go home, maybe I can help make a new temple. But what is the point of that? What is the point of having a temple, which is like a vessel with no Buddha in that vessel? I could rebuild a temple. But there would be no awakened person there. And what is the point of that?’ To this Master Gisan said, ‘Yes. Yes, there does have to be one like that for the vessel to be used. However, even if you get deeply awakened, with that lack of a deep feeling of compassion you must never go into the world.’</p><p class="P4">The monk did become deeply awakened. And he went to a small temple in the north of Japan by the sea, near the temple that had burned down,  and he never left that temple. Having been deeply awakened, he was called from many places and invited to teach, but he would answer each invitation by saying that it had been the orders from his teacher, he could not come; and he stayed always in that small temple in Hamasaka. Without deepest compassion, the Buddha Dharma will not stand. This is the same as the Mu of Joshu which teaches us and brings us into that realization. Compassion and wisdom are two wheels of a single cart, without either one it cannot move.</p><p class="P4">This is the central point, that what is most important in Mahayana Buddhism is a great, deep compassion, which makes us feel that everyone is our very own child. When we know this, then we cannot sit still if something is wrong with them; we have to take care of it. In Buddhism the word love is not used because it is so easily confused with that word of craving love, or love which is standing as an opposite to hate. But this kind of deepest compassion is the deepest training of the bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">In this way, Vimalakirti tells how he is sick because beings are sick and that brings deep compassion up in him, which is what he gets sick from, because he wants so badly to help others’ pain, to somehow take it away, pluck it out. This is the state of mind of the bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">In fact, there is not one single person born without this deep compassion. When we are caught on a mind full of material and craving desires, we lose track of that compassion—‘He is wrong. That is what’s wrong with this world. Because of them, there are problems like that’—and our compassion stops working. We have to return to our original and deep mind of the bodhisattva that vows to save all beings, even before liberating oneself. This is the base of the bodhisattva’s vow. This is the base of our Buddha nature, our most true essence.</p><p class="P4">We do not have a clear mind just because we train. From the origin we are all endowed with that clear mind.</p><p class="P4">Manjusri works at trying to get Vimalakirti to talk now:</p><p class="P1">8. Mañjusri said, “Retired scholar, why is this room empty, with no servants?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti said, “The countries of the buddhas are also all empty.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked, “With what was it emptied?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “It was emptied with emptiness.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “How can emptiness use emptiness?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “It is empty through non-discriminating emptiness.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Can emptiness be discriminated?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “Discrimination is also empty.”</p><p class="P4">As the Sixth Patriarch has said, from the origin there is not one single thing. We think that there is. We think that there is a wife and children and a location we live in. But that is all delusion, because we don’t know the mind’s truth. ‘Emptiness is the truth of the mind. And emptiness is also the truth of the world.’ So he continues, Manjusri says, ‘Why? Why is this world, why is it all empty?’ Vimalakirti responds, ‘It’s empty because it’s empty. Because from the beginning it’s empty.’ It is empty because empty is not empty. Even having things, if we are not obstructed by them, then that is empty. But we go into town, we are in a busy street, if we are hanging on to nothing at all, not opposing thoughts and ideas and mentations, then we are walking there and everything is empty. But instead we are saying, ‘Oh I saw this person and I saw that person, and I did that, and this is what I thought about.’ These are all dualistic concepts. Without them, it is all empty.  Yet this is not a conceptual nihilism.</p><p class="P4">The Buddha’s world is empty, meaning that there is no self-conscious awareness of anything. Even if there are things or people around, is dualism there or no dualism there? If we drown in concepts, we cannot know emptiness. That is why one who hears it without even being aware of hearing it becomes one with it. And this is true of each sense. </p><p class="P4">If what was previously perceived is still being clung to in our perception, if we are still holding on to what we were seeing or hearing in the previous perception, then we cannot clearly see that which comes now. Instead, we keep adding things on and on and on and putting more thoughts to that which we perceive. So we get tired. We use up extra energy. We are free to think clearly and use better perceptions, but it is such a waste of our energy! It makes us tired. It uses up extra energy that we want to have for other things. However, we have to see our life’s value and be awake to what it is that we are actually doing. We are not living vaguely here. We are not living unrelated to other things. If we are in emptiness we don’t have dualism: we are not hanging on to things.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti is saying, being dualistic is also empty. The words of the Sixth Patriarch say it clearly: What is the fundamental stance? It is that there are no mind-moments to even be polluted: that there is no form, that there is no ‘I’, that there is no form of a self, and that there is no abiding. That we are always in flux, flowing, never located, never stagnant. In this way, we can see how there is nothing to be held onto. Or, as Master Rinzai has put it, to add on no associations to our first direct perception. If we don’t add on second or third associations, then we are always in direct contact, just perceiving, and not engaging in dualism. If we see it exactly as it is and add nothing at all to it, it does not remain in our awareness. It is not about understanding about this. It is just like this. Vimalakirti is saying concepts are empty as well. All of this is coming forth from human’s true source.</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Where should emptiness be sought?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “It should be sought within the sixty-two [heterodox] views.”</p><p class="P4"><span class="indexTerm">Mujaku</span> had been told that he could find a living Manjusri on <span class="indexTerm">Mount Godai</span>.[<span class="indexTerm">Blue Cliff Record</span>, <span class="indexTerm">The dialogue of Manjusri and Wu Cho</span>. (35)]. Because he wanted to have a Dharma encounter with Manjusri, he climbed the mountain. As nightfall approached, he hadn’t met anyone like Manjusri. It was almost dark when an old man came along leading a cow. Mujaku explained very meticulously why he had come there to meet Manjusri bodhisattva. The old man took him to a temple.</p><p class="P4">There the old man showed him a cup, a very precious and rare cup used for drinks that were so fragrant and indescribable, his eyes and his tongue would melt if he tasted them. At that time this mondo took place.</p><p class="P4">The old man asked, “From where have you come?”</p><p class="P4">Mujaku answered, “I have come from the south.”</p><p class="P4">“Oh. How is the Buddhism in the south these days?”</p><p class="P4">“There are a few people who are obeying the precepts, but it is only about that.”</p><p class="P4">“How many monks are there?”</p><p class="P4">“There are 300 or 500 monks. And how is the Buddha Dharma here?”</p><p class="P4">The old man answered, “Dragons and snakes are all mixed up together, the gold and the sand are all mixed up, and those who are enlightened and ignorant are all mixed up together, too.”</p><p class="P4">“How many are there?”</p><p class="P4">“Before three and three, behind three and three.” This is how he answered.</p><p class="P4">Mujaku asked to stay for one night, but he wasn’t allowed to do so. He thanked the old man warmly. As the old man saw Mujaku to the gate, a younger man went along with them. Surreptitiously, Mujaku asked the young man, “That old man said, ‘Before three and three, behind three and three.’ How many are really here?”</p><p class="P4">The young man called out Mujaku’s name, and he answered, “Yes?”</p><p class="P4">The young man responded, “How many is this?” This was not your usual young man.</p><p class="P4">Mujaku then asked, “What temple is this, anyway?”</p><p class="P4">As he asked, he looked up to point at the temple’s gate, and suddenly there was no more old man, no more temple, no more young man—there was nothing at all.</p><p class="P4">Mujaku stayed on Mount Godai and trained there a long time, living in a place known as the Diamond Sutra Cave. He realized that the old man he had encountered there, was, in fact, the living Manjusri.</p><p class="P4">This mondo is found in the Blue Cliff Records as a koan [Manjusri’s “Three and Three”(35)], Manjusri is the manifestation of Prajna wisdom, the manifestation of emptiness. This is a koan between Mujaku, who represents the awareness of differences and Manjusri who is the manifestation of our basic true wisdom and emptiness. It is a discussion between these two. To “observe the precepts”, and “to have 300 or 500”, these are expressions of the world of differences. But the “Snakes and dragons are all mixed up together, sand and gold are all combined”—these are expressions of all of the worlds of emptiness beyond walls, the breaking down of all barriers. “before three and three and behind three and three” is where numbers cannot reach, the wisdom beyond numbers, the basic Prajna wisdom. These meet as these two meet, the 62 convictions are the same as this. But in living, both the wisdom of differences and basic wisdom are necessary. To understand good and bad, this and that, to make these clear and to observe the truth and peace, is the right way to do things. But these ideas about good and bad and right and wrong also have to be forgotten sometimes so we can meet in that place as well.</p><p class="P4">In my case while it is true that I am this physical age, in my life I don’t stay aware of that age. Forgetting myself and teaching all of the students here, that is my truth. While teaching them to go beyond mental understanding, there are those who go deep quickly and those who are shallow still, new and old timers, but all together they work and dig into the world of the Buddha. This is the world of the Buddha’s teaching: </p><p class="P4">Manjusri: “Householder, where should emptiness be sought?”</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti: “Manjusri, emptiness should be sought among the sixty-two convictions.” </p><p class="P4">We find it within differentiation. There is no equality outside of differentiation. People are all mixed up together, and to be aware of this is very important. Amida Nyorai said all sentient beings, old people, young people, splendid people, dangerous people—there is no difference in them—all the people mixed up together are the world of emptiness, just as God bestows rain on both the good and the evil.</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Where should the sixty-two views be sought?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “They should be sought within the emancipation of the buddhas.”</p><p class="P4">Here Manjusri continues, ‘Where should emptiness be found?’ It is in the sixty-two convictions. In Ancient India, at the time when this is talking about, there was a teaching of the sixty-two convictions. It is not about looking for emptiness by retreating into the deep mountains, but about becoming it wherever we are. The sixty two convictions are sixty two ways of functioning in our mind. Thirty-one ways that have both subjective and objective parts to them. No matter how hard we try we cannot become as pure in our mind as a baby is. In each moment, we are manifesting eighteen worlds, and this is our most pure way of perceiving. So we live just as things are and respond to them just as they come. If we could live simply like this—but instead we add on many complex conversations and ideas and associations to everything that we perceive. We lose track of things so quickly and are unable to see them just as they are. If we were holding onto nothing complex, we could see and hear purely. To say, I don’t hear, to say I don’t see, to say I don’t taste, I don’t smell, this is not living life energy. To live and to perceive in the most simple way possible. This is the way to live purely. We are continually attending to our various ideas. If we are always living in samadhi, however, we are therein receiving and accepting what comes perfectly to us exactly as it is. And with that we can see, for example, how a person who is in front of us, see their conditioning very clearly, not from what they are saying or doing, but we are able to perceive beyond words. And this is a very sharp place. We perceive, and we accept completely what we perceive. Then onto the next moment completely as well, not thinking about the moment that has just passed, or about how much we have to do this or have to do that. We have a direct perception, an intuitive perception. We are all living in each mind-moment completely and totally. So we have to simply be in that, and then there is no problem.</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Where should the emancipation of the buddhas be sought?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “It should be sought within the mental processes of all sentient beings.</p><p class="P4">In our life in society, we taste with our mouth, we see with our eyes. In the midst of our life, we live in these perceptions. Deepen these. We are without extra mental ideas added on if we merely perceive directly. But we have to live our lives in the world with all of its connecting relationships. To let go of all that. We think about that day at the World Trade Center, nine years ago on the same day. Here we were living the same schedule that we are living this year. It was around eight-fifteen in the morning, sixth day of osesshin, and we were here without any media contact. Before we heard anything about it from the outside, someone came and told us. People in the zendo were welcome to leave because of this, to decide for themselves what to do, and everyone stayed. All around the world people were looking at this event on the news over and over and over again, the same scene was playing.</p><p class="P4">People were rushing to the store to buy up whatever there was, afraid that it would soon be sold out. Finally we were unable to leave anyway, because there were no planes flying. But people sat and were able to deepen their state of mind by being here. These things were being directly perceived because of that, without all of that imposing information and ideas. This is the liberation of the Tathagatas. There are many examples of this in the phrases of Zen: While holding the hoe we have no sense of digging the field. While walking, we forget our feet. This is a common kind of samadhi. We are walking, but we are not thinking about our feet walking. It is actually easier to have an accident if we are heading for a red light, thinking about how we are going to be there soon, because we are not one with our walking. We would stop when we got there anyway. But our mind is full of thoughts and ideas about what we are doing, rather than simply walking and forgetting our body completely. This is also possible if we are doing a simple activity like playing a sport or playing piano. Finally in that music, that playing piano for example, we lose track of the music lines, we lose track of our hands playing the piano, we lose track of even the piano, and only then is the best note able to come forth. If we are always thinking about how we are playing and how we are doing and self-conscious about it all, we can’t perform in our best possible way. Things happen naturally</p><p class="P4">in their best way if we are not caught on self-conscious awareness. We learn to work empty-minded by doing it over and over and over again. And then our truth comes forth clearly and brightly revealed.</p><p class="P1">“Also, regarding your question about why there are no servants—all the host of Maras and [followers of] the heterodox paths are all my servants. Why? The host of Maras take pleasure in samsara, and the bodhisattvas do not forsake samsara. Those of the heterodox paths take pleasure in the views, and Bodhisattvas are unmoved by the views.”</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti answers, ‘There is no attendant necessary for me here, because everything in the world is my attendant. There is nothing that has to be done this way or must be done that way, so everything is my attendant. My perceptions, all of those perceptions, these are all my attendants. There may be good and evil people, but they are also all my attendants.’ </p><p class="P4">As the Zen master <span class="indexTerm">Dokan</span> said,</p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">When we are facing a calamity, a calamity is fine.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">When we are facing sickness, sickness is just fine.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">When we are dying, dying is just fine.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">This calamity is my attendant, this sickness is my attendant.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">It could even be said that death is my attendant.</span></p><p class="P4">If we could all have this wide open state of mind and awakened perception! Usually, though, people are all worried about what they are going to need in their old age. If we consider from a larger perspective and see that if we are needed we will be kept alive, and if not we will die and that’s fine. </p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">Life in this transient world of flux.  </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">Looking back, no words can express it. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">Throw away all karmic connections! </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">Go straight home! </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">At the end of a life, no satori, no ignorance.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="textMacron">Becoming peaceful, the whole universe: green mountains.</span></p><p class="P4">But people instead are always trying to figure out how much they are going to need to put aside for their old age. Better, we don’t want someone saying about us, ‘I wish they’d just get out of here! I wish they’d just die and be done with it!’ Who wants that said about them? Instead, to have a newer and larger view, to see the bigger picture. Seeing it like this, every being and each experience is my attendant.</p><p class="P1">9. Mañjusri said, “Retired scholar, what characteristics does your illness have?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti said, “My illness is without form, invisible.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Is this an illness of body or of mind?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti said, “It is not of the body, since the body transcends characteristics. Nor is it of the mind, since the mind is like a phantasm.”</p><p class="P4">Here Manjusri bodhisattva asks, he wants to know, what type of sickness is Vimalakirti suffering from. What nature of sickness is it? ‘The wounded society is the cause,’ he tells him. This is not about his physical body’s condition. Next, he answers ‘I am sick because of a certain behavior. This is all that can be said.’ What is the source? What is the cause? The doctor can tell us what it is if it has to do with our stomach, our kidneys, or our liver, but these are not the causes of sickness in this case. “My sickness is immaterial and invisible,” he answers. It has no form. In this way we cannot truly examine the sickness that he has.</p><p class="P4">It has no form, so it cannot be something which is physical. So, many people say, ‘You say it has no form, but then how do you know that you are sick?’ When he asks him if it is physical or mental, Vimalakirti answers that it is not his body because he does not think of it as a body. He has forgotten his body, so physical symptoms are not present. And as for it being mental, our mind is like waves, so how can that which is always changing, be sick? It maybe just looks bad for a moment, but then that changes immediately. In one mind-moment we may be happy and joyful, but then that changes again. We are never always straight out happy and joyful, and we are never always straight out miserable and depressed. Our mind has no form from the very origin.</p><p class="P4">People sometimes think that zazen will make them feel better, but it doesn’t work like that. Our physical body is not a fixed form. It is not a thing. To think that it is that is truly sickness. It would be like trying to calm waves. If we wish to calm them, then we have to leave them alone; the more we try to do anything to them, the more they are disrupted. The word for mind-moment is written as ‘now’ and ‘mind’. It is the state of our seeing a flower or a bird, so as Master Rinzai wrote, ‘To not add on any second associations to what we perceive. Just as we perceive it. To not add on any second perceptions or associations to what we see and perceive is more useful than ten years of pilgrimage.’</p><p class="P4">We have eyes, and so we see. We have ears, and so we hear. We have a nose, and so we smell, a mouth and so we taste. But we have to just leave it as it is, just as it is freshly perceived, leave it at that. We are so conditioned to always add on thoughts and give attention to what we are perceiving. To add on ideas to it. To be caught on what we are seeing. To be caught on what we are hearing. Just leave it as it is. We don’t add on any extra thinking to our perceiving.</p><p class="P4">We see a big feast, and we eat until we are full. But it is so good that we start thinking about how we have to eat more and more. We hear someone bad-mouthing us, and we get angry and even hostile thinking about it. We should simply think about it as someone flapping their lips into the air.</p><p class="P4">We worry that we should be worrying more about the future. It exhausts us, and what’s more, it’s all for nothing. Just as is worrying about and imagining things that have not yet happened but are in our mind. Our mind is always, always bringing up more thoughts, but we just don’t give them attention.</p><p class="P4">As the <span class="indexTerm">Sixth Patriarch</span> has said in his definition of <span class="indexTerm">zazen</span>, ‘To that which we are perceiving externally, we don’t add on any stratum of thoughts of good and bad. And to that which arises within, we don’t bring any concern.’ He is teaching us to just be exactly like a mirror. If we don’t get to this point, then it is not truly zazen. And as the Sixth Patriarch said in his definition, to not attend to those ideas that arise within. Rather, to create no further thoughts about either what is external or internal, and this has to also be a place of not storing up ideas about things. To not collect thoughts about what is to come. When we do sesshin, to realize this and hold precious each and every single moment’s state of mind. Our body is a collection of parts. It can be said to exist in that way, as a collection of parts, but it is in no way something which is fixed. Vimalakirti is forgetting the body, so it cannot be sick.</p><p class="P1">Mañjusri asked further, “Of the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air, to which element does this illness belong?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti answered, “This illness is not of the earth element, but neither does it transcend the earth element. The water, fire, and wind elements are likewise. However, the illnesses of sentient beings arise from the four elements, and because they are ill I am ill.”</p><p class="P4">Next, Manjusri asks in further detail, since his first line of interrogation about physical and mental was unsuccessful; he was getting nowhere. His question reflects the way of thinking in India at that time, where all things were considered to be made up of these four elements. All things of form were made up in this way, a combination of four elements. For example, in our body we have a temperature, a body temperature, and that is considered to be the element of fire. We are always changing, and that is considered to be the element of wind. Our bones and our flesh, are they sick, perhaps? Or is it your blood and your lymph which is sick? Are you sick in your breath, or is your temperature very low perhaps? He asks him like this about his sickness and these possible symptoms.</p><p class="P4">But this is how Vimalakirti answered. I am sick because everyone is so disturbed. Not from an upset-ness in the four elements. Because of their disharmony with the elements, I am sick. People in the world are sick, and I want them to be better. That is my sickness. But my four elements are doing just fine. In the old days, people were together living and caring for each other, very concerned about each other’s condition and health and how each other were doing all the time. Parents were so concerned over their children’s health that they would actually experience their children’s sickness.</p><p class="P4"> We have the words about how the <span class="indexTerm">cow</span> in the province of Kaishu in Konan would eat, and then the horse in the province of Eky in Jishensha would get full. These are very, very far away, these two parts of China. It is like a cow in Japan eating, and a horse in the United States getting full because that Japanese cow ate. But when we have a crisis on the planet, we do what we can, even when people are very far away. People from Africa are starving, and people all over the world are trying to get funds to help them–feeling their pain and feeling their suffering which is so similar. We experience each other’s pain and suffering, and we cannot just let that go. To realize Mu is just like this. We let go of our own small-minded personal feelings and perceptions and movement of mind, and we become one with all beings. This is the samadhi of letting go of everything and becoming that Mu. We can then function hugely both in a world we can and cannot perceive visibly.</p><p class="P4">This is how we can use that functioning if we can let go of that small-self. But it is not about looking for a motionless mind either. People frequently make that mistake. We won’t understand Vimalakirti by trying to find within us a mind that is never moving. To become one with all of the people in the world is to have no individual person that we are thinking we are. And if we cannot see this, then we cannot understand Vimalakirti, and we cannot understand the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P4">Today, people are so involved making their own small world in their own small corner. But seeing all of these as one is the way of the Buddha. We have his first precepts. “In the way of the most profound, subtle, clear, mysterious mind, we vow to not cut one precious life”. When the Buddha was traveling, he always walked with a stick to warn the animals and small insects to get out of the way. He would even filter the water he drank, so no small bugs would be in the water. This is not only for protecting his health but for taking care of even the smallest beings. We have the scroll of the Buddha on his moment of entering into nirvana. As he is on his side, gathered around him are all of his disciples, all of the followers and the gods in the heavens, but also all of the animals, the insects, the reptiles, the birds, all of them in great mourning at seeing the Buddha depart. All the disciples and the animals and insects are weeping and mourning and grieving at his entering into nirvana. And we should be able to have people sad and missing us when we are dying too, because we have been so together with them. In this one single world, with all of its animals, all of its minerals, all of the things that are always being born, recognizing and acknowledging each and every single one of them—to see in this way is how we have to live.</p><p class="P4">This is why we work so hard on this aspect with people who are new on the path. To work with the Mu, which is the way of living from this state of mind. For this Joshu gave us this Mu. We have to let go of all of our small-minded identity to become this Mu completely. For doing that, we have to dig and dig and dig until we let go of all of our mental activity, our rational, dualistic, divided ways of looking at things. That has to be let go of completely, or we won’t be able to realize that state of mind, which the Buddha realized in his moment of awakening as he exclaimed “How wondrous! How wondrous! All beings without exception are endowed from the origin with this same, True mind to which I have just awakened.” He saw this whole universe. To see in the way so that we can know our true master who is not someone who is dependent on a someone else or a something else. This is what the Vimalakirti Sutra is also teaching us. It cannot be mental understanding. It has to be from experience.</p><p class="P4">Please, he prays very deeply, that everyone’s zazen should be zazen like this.</p><p class="P1">10. At that time Mañjusri asked Vimalakirti, “How should Bodhisattvas comfort Bodhisattvas who are ill?”</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti’s sickness has been asked about and answered about, and the Buddha’s request to go and visit Vimalakirti has been fulfilled in form, and from here Vimalakirti is given an opportunity to speak his wisdom. The person who is asking the questions is always of great importance. If they ask the best questions, then an answer can come forth which is not concept and which is not distant in its essence. Manjusri knows the answers already, of course, but he gets Vimalakirti to say these answers, and that is why he asks this question about how should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is sick, because this life is not about just satisfying ourselves. Our life is completely about deepening our own state of mind while guiding others in their liberation. To teach the truth without ceasing, and with that wisdom to be useful to all of society. Useless conceptualization is without meaning. To deepen oneself, and to liberate all others! We receive light in this world, but it is not for our own personal happiness. If it is only lived in that way it separates us from others, isolates us. It is to see the society just as it is, who we are, and who we are relative to society.</p><p class="P4">Sentient beings and all of humankind, and how we are as humanity—we have been given life not for our own pleasure but to give radiance in the world for everyone. The garden’s flowers are not stuck in their own opinion as they bloom, because they are not blooming for themselves. If it were only for themselves or for their descendants, why would they become so many wonderful colors and so many, many varieties? All animals and living things are becoming their most valuable and essential version. We are born to become the best possible version of ourselves, which is a bodhisattva who is of service to others. Manjusri asks how to visit a sick friend, how to both bring forth bodhisattva. Everyone knows the challenge of this: how difficult it can be to visit a person who is dying, for example. Often we don’t know what to say.</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti said, “Explain that the body is impermanent but do not teach that one should have aversion for one’s body. Explain that the body suffers but do not teach that one should take pleasure in nirvana. Explain that the body is without self but teach that one should guide sentient beings [anyway]. Explain that the body is emptily serene but do not teach that it is ultimately extinguished.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti answers that people are always changing, everything is always in flux. We often say as words of consolation, life is so temporary, isn’t it. All is truly transient. We use these words, but it is not only about death or consoling. A birth is also a matter of flux and transiency as well. We are always evolving. So getting bigger and developing and evolving is also a matter of transiency. We are all occasionally sick. This is a transient thing. There is nothing that doesn’t change, and so we have to not waste our precious chances. We cannot wait. The karmic effects of everything and our affiliation to them are temporary, as is our being born as a human being. We cannot waste our precious time. </p><p class="P4">The Buddha was the first to say that all is temporary and there is no such thing as a fixed ego. He looked very carefully and clearly at how life is and how things are. And how everything has a cause, and for each cause there is an effect. This is even before the idea of a God, and all things happen in life according to how the laws of cause and effect move. So that’s why things are always changing and flowing. Death, too, is one of those fluctuations. And all things are affected by laws of cause and effect. This is what must be said, and this is what is important to see clearly. There is nothing we can do to make things last forever. Our stocks which we thought were so safe, for example, lose their value drastically in a difficult economical time. We have to awaken to how circumstances will always change, not only for our own body, but also for everybody. When we are sick, we can become weaker. We do not know when it will be gone. But you can’t make people who are sick think about it in this way. Nor about how difficult the world is and how they should want to get away from it. But to see deeply. To talk about one’s deep intention and visions, to help regenerate them. It is like a candle, which burns brightly as it shines, and eventually it burns down. It continues to give light, though, even as it burns down. Like this: giving of our life and wisdom to all of society.</p><p class="P4">Everyone knows that being alive is suffering, although people always live to be happy. But suffering is always part of the picture: The suffering of being born, of living, of being sick, of dying. Our parents make such great efforts just to stay alive and give us a place, food, and clothing. We also have to make great efforts to have all of the things we want: a big house, a great car, attention-drawing clothes. And we all also do get sick, a little food poisoning, a cold here and there. We are not super flowers or statues, we get a pain here, a problem there. And many times our bodies don’t allow us to feel our best. Eventually we die, everything dies. In the world it is dying that is the same for every single person.</p><p class="P4">We all experience this suffering at different times in our lives, such as the pain we have when we have to separate from a deeply loved one, or we have to live on for some reason that we can barely understand, with the same person who we just cannot stand. To seek and seek and seek and not be able to acquire what it is that we try so hard to get to—there is this kind of pain and suffering as well. These kinds of pains as well as the pains of birth, life, sickness and death. We have these eight great sufferings which the Buddha told us to see clearly. And it is because we know these kinds of suffering clearly that we so appreciate even the slightest kindness from someone. Remember it, and don’t forget it. So why is there this suffering? Because we gather things. Because we accumulate them; then we get attached to them. But we also can give to others, because we have a physical body. But we can’t say to a sick person that this leg or that part is so full of such suffering. Nor should we talk about hurrying up and getting into nirvana.</p><p class="P4">Master <span class="indexTerm">Tokai Jokai</span> said this world is full of suffering when it is so hot and when it can be so cold. This world of suffering means a world where there is such a thing as living and dying, where there is this dualistic way of thinking about things. So how can we escape this world? Master <span class="indexTerm">Tõzan</span>’s answer was not so indulgent. When hot we have to become completely hot. When cold, become completely cold. Don’t look away from it. Look right at it, to where you are completely alive, smack in the middle of it. It doesn’t come again twice this life. This would work if it were Master Tõzan saying this. Someone else talking like this to someone sick in the hospital—it might not go over so well.</p><p class="P1">“Explain that one should regret one’s former transgressions but do not teach that they enter into the past. Comfort the illness of others with one’s own illness. One should recognize the innumerable kalpas of suffering of one’s past lives. One should be mindful of benefiting all sentient beings and remember one’s cultivation of blessings, be mindful of one’s pure livelihood without generating vexation but always generating exertion. Be the physician king, healing the host of illnesses. Thus should Bodhisattvas comfort Bodhisattvas who are ill, making them happy.”</p><p class="P4">Since this world is always changing, we will always see a change, even from our deepest suffering. But if our state of mind becomes stagnant, that is what is most challenging and happens often when we are sick. If we know, though, that all is changing and see the bigger picture, we know how what we see, hear, and feel about it—glad, sad, happy, or miserable—will always change. This is how it always goes along, just as we sit, and then we stand, and then we lay down, and then we get up. </p><p class="P4">Even if someone is in bed all day long, still it is important to be as independent and in as much motion as possible: To go to the bathroom, to be moved to keep away bed sores, and if at all possible to move ourselves. To go to the bathroom on our own, even when we can’t eat solid food any more. It is part of our being free and our feeling capable. We are always encountering all different kinds of situations. </p><p class="P4">It is good to read and broaden our mind’s awareness and travel widely to increase our motivation. When we are sick in bed, it is hard to get motivated in these ways. So to talk to a sick person in a way that excites their motivation about world travel that we have done or other pleasant things. People in a hospital should be given a lot of encouragement so that they don’t get stale in their motivation and their energy.</p><p class="P4">Our body of sixty million cells is also always changing. It has no fixed form. Yet it gets sick. It gets weak. While it has no fixed form, it can get sick and in pain, and it can get better again. It is in deep change always. And being in bed is just different from being up and out of bed. Day and night rhythms are also different. We can easily get pulled around by different things. As much as possible, to sleep at night and be awake in the day time. That’s the best. We get up and we feel good in order to be reinvigorated. If we get pulled around by circumstances, we lose our freedom. While we are in this body, we need to make an effort to use it in the best possible way. We can’t give up on the use of our body. Rather, to try to keep a good rhythm and a regular schedule.</p><p class="P4">To not confuse this physical body. It is our borrowed tool. We need to use this tool well, and we should be thankful for it. To give it the best possible way of its being alive and our being alive. All the way to the body’s final moments, to care for it well and make efforts for its best way of being. To bring to this body the great wisdom, to see the truth of the Dharma, and to sustain a person in this way. When we are visiting them, to bring them this kind of energy and awareness. In this way, Vimalakirti teaches.</p><p class="P4">We have to see our body also in its biological context: how it has evolved over the eras and in the context of the survival of the fittest. And we have, during these times of our past, done things so that we could survive. So we also have to think of our responsibility for how things have been in our past. As Master Joshu has said, all of us have karmic affiliations. We’ve made mistakes. We have many circumstances, connections. So we have to purify that mind that has made mistaken choices in the past, to realize them, and to realize our state of mind. We have zazen to purify this mind, to clarify it. It is not about making ourselves be overly regretful, but to purify our mind in this very moment. This is what our zazen is and how we can do it with our zazen. This brings us to our healthiest human mind. To be able to see this and to cherish this moment, living in a healthy state of mind. To always be clear that we don’t want to lose the health of our mind.</p><p class="P4">And when we are sick, we can understand well the insecurity of someone else’s sickness, how they feel. And we feel the connection to those who have suffered in the past with an even greater pain. We are taught this by how our own pain feels. We pray for those who are in pain all over the world. We are determined to help other people who are suffering, when we might get better. And even if we don’t get better, to see that there are others in the same pain and greater, and pray for their relief, and also clarify and purify our own mind, so that we can pray in the best way and can deepen our vow and deepen our prayer for all people to be able to be free from suffering. In Africa, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and for everyone even in the smallest, struggling country, to pray for all of them.</p><p class="P4">Even if we are lying down, we still can become an expert from our own experience on the sickness which we have, and then give life to what we have experienced so that our being sick can be helpful to others. To become like a doctor who is an expert on our own sickness and write it down and share what we are learning with others. To let go of our darkness and remember this great state of mind. For this we have the words of Vimalakirti and his own experience of being sick. To offer to share this with all other people.</p><p class="P4">By being sick, it does not mean that we are some kind of outcast. It means we have yet another chance for deepening our wisdom and sharing that with all people. It is in this way that Vimalakirti is teaching us.</p><p class="P1">11. Mañjusri said, “Retired scholar, how should the Bodhisattva who is ill control his mind?”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti said, “The Bodhisattva who is ill should think as follows:</p><p class="P1">“‘This present illness of mine comes entirely from the false concepts, confusions, and afflictions of previous lives. There is no actual Dharma that experiences illness.’</p><p class="P4">So what is sickness anyway? If we get attached to an idea of an “I”, of being an “I”, then we get sick. When we let go of that attachment, then we are free and clear. Manjusri goes to see Vimalakirti and asks him many questions; the point of his visit is in fact to ask him these questions. Yet, he can’t stray from the point either, that he is sick. So he asks about his sickness, and where it’s from, and how to not get caught on it, and how to find the wisdom that goes beyond it and comes with having it. He meticulously talks about all of this with Vimalakirti. “What is the way of thinking and holding the mind for a sick Vimalakirti?” No one is healthy forever. We all come to a life that has sickness, old age, and death in it. This all comes after our birth. A few people of perhaps excellent past lives don’t have any great sickness and are clear and have nothing difficult and die naturally. Nevertheless, we all do have past lives and their results. We mostly don’t even want to hear about what we’ve done in the past, it’s been so unskillful at times. But we have to see this and look at it, since it applies to everything that comes after.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti says that he is not sick from being confused and deluded but because of the unenlightened and confused people who are drowned in ego and lack of wisdom. Seeing this and not being able to sit still with seeing it, he also is sick.</p><p class="P4">In the world we are not isolated, nor can we live only by ourselves. If there is a cold going around, we also are subjected in this cold. There are many viruses in the world, and these viruses go everywhere. In society, there are many destructive things happening in the environment. We receive the pollution in the air, the food, and in the water. This is a natural way that things have come to be. We can do something about small challenges, but we cannot avoid pollution and droughts and famines. This is the sickness that Vimalakirti is talking about.</p><p class="P4">Today the whole world is sick and we cannot escape from this. Humans remain so mistrustful of each other that we cannot believe what is inside of us. Therefore, all people are sick. It is something that we cannot escape from, a sickness of all humankind. “Were all beings to be free of sickness I also would not be sick.” As long as this world is sick, I cannot be not sick. Only when this world’s sickness ends, can I then no longer be sick. Only when humankind’s sickness of mistrust is resolved will there be a true trust among people. When we can discover this, then humans will be able to trust each other. A trusting kind of society will then be possible, and we can discover this way of being.</p><p class="P4">So Vimalakirti‘s cause of sickness cannot be known without knowing the sickness of the whole world. All beings’ sickness cannot be resolved until belief and harmony is discovered. This is not only for Vimalakirti; it is also for each and every one of us. Vimalakirti is not someone special. If we were not sick and someone was to say there is no sickness, then that person is the source of sickness. Such a person would add more sickness to the world.</p><p class="P4">One with the True mind of a parent will see and say that there is a problem. However, they will not be able to leave it at that. If we have a clear regular mind, we see with a single glance that the world, people, and environment are sick. Our being sick is a natural fact. That is a healthy perception of the actuality. What Vimalakirti says is not something special. We have to take responsibility in this world and for humankind and for our own way of being and living.</p><p class="P1">“Why? ‘Body’ is a provisional name for a conglomeration of the four elements, and the four elements have no master. “The body also has no self. Furthermore, the arising of this illness is entirely due to attachment to self. Therefore, one should not generate attachment regarding the self. You should understand that this is the foundation of illness and so eliminate the conception of ‘self ’ and the conception of ‘sentient being.’</p><p class="P4">When you get sick, it is so easy to get depressed. Vimalakirti says a sick bodhisattva should first look at his own mind, which we usually forget to do when we are sick; this is a new way of looking at things when we are sick. We need to look at the source of the sickness, not just make up stories that make it worse. This is why when you see a sick person, often their eyes are out of focus. They don’t look to see how things really are. For a person who is alcoholic, it could be they are sick from too much sake. Or we could have something wrong with our heart from not treating our body right. We may live in such a way that we are actually doing things that are causing this sickness but turn our eyes away from that.</p><p class="P4">Then there is the environment in society that also affects us. These matters of food and housing; all of them have become quite unnatural. Also, all of the unusual grumbling and negative thoughts, then reaching for cigarettes or eating junk food rather than things that are more natural and good for our body. We eat junk food and it even becomes addictive. This sickness comes from our past lives, too. But since we don’t look at our overall present way of being or our past from our former lives, we can so easily get caught on too much eating, too much drinking, too much smoking. </p><p class="P4">If we would look at this with our objective eyes, we could see what we are doing that is causing this sickness, and we could also look more carefully and broadly at how our past lives may be affecting us. If we look objectively, then we can see how all of our addictions and our mistakes and attachments have come from our past lives.</p><p class="P4">Who is sick? We have to look at it in this way. Today the medical world is so advanced, and there is so much information, so much variety in treatment. But if we ignore our past lives we can make a big mistake, thinking that, well, if it gets bad we can just go to the doctor and have our genes looked at to get rid of any possibility of getting cancer. We think that we don’t have to get sick and can take care of it so easily, so we don’t have to take care of our daily habits because after all we can get something fixed. This is a way of life. We can also do it in a way that is blaming the doctors for not making us better. But who made us sick? We have to see this. As a result of our genes we sometimes have a difficult situation from birth. We have to wonder, is this from a past life’s behavior? It occurs to us then to examine the bigger picture. We have to see the possibilities of all parts of this and where it comes from, not just see that becoming sick is something that turns us into something like a monster.</p><p class="P4">We all misunderstand and think, ‘This is my body; so I am sick.’</p><p class="P1">“The body also has no self. Furthermore, the arising of this illness is entirely due to attachment to self. Therefore, one should not generate attachment regarding the self. You should understand that this is the foundation of illness and so eliminate the conception of ‘self ’ and the conception of ‘sentient being.’</p><p class="P4">It’s all about thinking that it’s ‘me, me, me’ and “I” am sick and ‘my’ body is sick. But the body is only a collection of elements, like a file of data, and these elements become our eyes and our ears, our nose, our mouth, our brain cells, our blood, our liver. Is there anyone who invented the body themselves? We are born from a uterus, and all of the tools that we need are usually present when we are born. Who invented these tools though? They were in our data. Occasionally someone with no legs and hands is born. This has happened from insufficient data, so we are not born complete. This is not the fault of our parents. This is not the fault of ourselves. The body is a kimono for coming into this world. When we are called ‘something-something-Jan’ (that is a nickname in Japanese, ‘something-something-Jan’) and are called it enough times all day long, we think that is who we are: we are a body. Then we become that idea that we are that body. But what is the something that moves that body? And our organs, which work independently, this is controlled by the brain cells. But who tells those brain cells what to do and what to tell the organs? People think that this is their body and their personal tool. Sickness does not come out of empty space, nor is it from thinking about things a certain way. We get sick and imagine that we have caused it ourselves.</p><p class="P4">This <span class="indexTerm">body, like a tool</span>, breaks because of the way we use it. So we would like to order a new one, please. That would be splendid if we could do it, and it would get a Nobel Prize! But it doesn’t work like that, and so we have to take care of ourselves—take care not to catch a cold, take care of our body. Some people die at birth, some when they are children, some in their teens, some work for a good lifetime. But still, the body is a tool. It is a kimono, and we have to take extra care of it and use it carefully. We may come with a liver that may be good for nine-hundred years if it is used right. But if we don’t use our body with care it gets broken, and it doesn’t last that long. Nevertheless, it is a tool. Without that tool we cannot offer our service to people in the world. But this body, who is it that makes it sick?</p><p class="P4">We all mistakenly think this body is who we actually are. We misuse it for our desires, and it gets sick. Or, we have past life history that makes it sick. But, whichever of those is the cause, it is still a tool. So now, you are sick too: well, body, you have been such a good tool, we’ll get through this together. But not to think that we are born this way, as this. This is a mistaken view.</p><p class="P4">But this sickness does manifest through the physical body, and we get more and more sick because we are caught on being this physical body. Well, if we see this, we should let go of our idea of ourselves as an entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality. We think we are this hardened, fixed ‘me’, but that is only a borrowed tool. We have many things we like to do; this goes along with our idea of who ‘I’ am, and we become used by it. We have to let go of that attachment to not be used by it. Instead, we should see ourselves exactly for what we actually are. To just see those various perception organs as they are. We can see and hear, we know sadness and gladness, but see them just as they are, for what they are themselves. Everyone has these. But getting caught on them, or getting attached to them, that is secondary. We can naturally already use them, and we can respond naturally when using them to the things that they encounter and perceive. We hear and respond. We don’t smell because there is a fragrance. We smell the fragrance, and we know there is a flower there. Some don’t have eyes or ears. But our True mind is not hampered by that. It is directly hearing and seeing and tasting naturally. That mind which perceives: we have to once separate from it through zazen. Zazen is not to make our perceptions better, or some culture that is founded on good perceptions. That is all irrelevant. Our mind is one and the same. The attachments that we make with it, with this mind, these attachments are not our natural, given way of being. To be aligned with our natural way is to not be attached.</p><p class="P1">“You should give rise to the conception of Dharmas, thinking as follows: ‘It is only through the combination of a host of Dharmas that this body is created. Its arising is only the arising of Dharmas, and its extinction is only the extinction of Dharmas.’ Also, ‘these Dharmas do not know themselves. When they arise, they do not say “I have arisen.” When they are extinguished, they do not say “I have become extinguished.”’</p><p class="P4">Our body is a collection of many things. We hold it together with lots of different things working to keep it together. Not because we make a call to them all and tell them to get going. They work together naturally and without stagnation. But we are so insecure about things, we get afraid of dying, and this body stopping. And why? It is because of our ego. It is our ego that thinks that we are this body. But it is simple. We are a gathered aggregate, and so we naturally scatter apart when the time comes. And when this is seen directly, it is just seeing things as they are. We can’t change this, but today we are infinitely confused about how this works, and this natural way of things, and so we are always trying to reinvent it and make it work in a way that we think we would like it to. In society, if we should break a law or go against a law, then we are punished. But life energy continues, no matter what. Even though humans invent things like plutonium on this planet, which threatens the planet’s life and human life, this great life energy continues onward and onward.</p><p class="P4">We have the bones and the flesh that make the form of the body. These are the elements of earth. More than half of our body is made up of liquid—the blood, the lymph system. This is the element of water. And then in our body we have a temperature, which makes it warm, then gets colder or warmer. That is the element of fire. And we have our breath, which is always coming in and going out. This is the element of wind. These elements make up a body, and these are just temporarily gathered elements. When we were first arriving in utero, we were only one cell, and as the program unfolded, all the necessary parts came together. We are actually from nothing at all, mistakenly thinking we are solid and that we have made this happen. But all of our cells, everything is in fact phenomena. Like wind blowing waves from the north, blowing waves from the south, blowing waves from the east and west, this is how our emotions work as well. Happy one moment, sad another moment—this mind is not something which is the same all the time.</p><p class="P4">All existence is in constant flux and will never stay the same. This world is truly always changing. It is like a dream, a phantom, like lightning, a fantasy, a shadow, and a mirage. Melancholic and transient, this is the truth of how it is. The Buddha taught this as well. The truth of this world and this truth have to be taught. Because people are dull and unawakened, we think we are here forever, and we get broken. This has to be told. This melancholic world of actuality has to be told. When people run away from this, then they get sick and have so many symptoms. Throwing it all away by running away; that is not the answer.</p><p class="P4">To say ‘throw away that suffering melancholic life’ is to briefly tell how to get out of this suffering world. But, this is not the way to speak to people about this. People are alive, and to be alive is to suffer. The Buddha gave us the truth of the Fourfold Path, the first line of which is that within this body are the ingredients for suffering, and this has to be taught. This world is not a place for just having a good time. </p><p class="P4">This world, with a physical body, is a place of suffering. Those who look for only their own pleasure have to be told how life is suffering. Our body is a bag of suffering; and for relief a world for peace must be taught. If only suffering is taught, a person will seek only for their own salvation and security, and that is a mistake. When a person seeks only their own personal happiness is the source of suffering in the first place. When we try to find only our own personal happiness our suffering begins. The world reflects our suffering back to us. </p><p class="P4">The Buddha said that all things are without an owner. No matter which part of our body we look at, that part is not “me”. We have joy and we have suffering; that which thinks of ourself as an “I”, with personal opinions or individual ideas, is what brings us suffering, pain, misery, delusion, and confusion. All of it originally comes because we get stuck on an idea of a “me”.</p><p class="P4">From the beginning there is no “me”. If we let go of that, we can see that there is no individual “I”. We get caught on that “me”, which is only a phenomena. We get caught on it as something fixed, and this is the source of our sickness, suffering, and misery. If we think there is no me at all, we use that idea to let go of a responsibility to society. This is not the point, either. If we do not get caught on an “I”, then we can give all of the capabilities and talent with which we are endowed to society, not dividing it half and half. We have to not get stuck on our own small-self ’s problems and challenges. The point is to see this “me” as a phenomena. If we get stuck on an “I”, we cannot find a resolution.  If we can let go of that “I”, a true resolution appears.</p><p class="P4">In giving all of our thoughts and ideas and actions to society, this is resolved. Then, even while we have pain, suffering, and misery, we can let go of it. While we are suffering, we can let go of that suffering. If we get caught on an “I”, we have pain and suffering. If we instead use that energy for society, although we still have pain, we are liberated from it. This is how it has to be told.</p><p class="P4">“In this world our body and mind are only phenomena. There is no society. It is all empty”. We cannot misunderstand it like this. Rather, to see that because everything is transient we have to hold as precious each moment’s encounter. We need to respect and appreciate every thing and love this world. Just because this world is always changing in every instant and is in constant flux, we cannot be lax and must be focused and without waste. This is what has to be taught.</p><p class="P1">12. “The Bodhisattva who is ill should undertake the conception (or: visualization) of the extinguished Dharmas. He should think as follows, ‘This conception of the Dharmas is also a confused [view]. Such a confused [view] is a great calamity, and I should transcend it.’</p><p class="P4">We are not born of our own will. Just like all things in nature, we are born in accordance with the law of cause and effect. Like all things changing–even an immovable mountain dissolves over tens of thousands of years–it all comes into being in accordance with law of cause and effect. Humans cannot direct those laws, saying ‘I’d rather do it like this or do it like that.’ But, neither can we get caught on thinking that it is all so irrelevant to us that there is nothing we can do about it. We need to instead see clearly how things actually are and then take responsibility for what we can. We have to let go of our attachment to things, like becoming attached</p><p class="P4">to a medicine that we take for a sickness because it makes us feel better, and then when that sickness is cured, still being attached to the medicine. This is also what is stressed by Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P1">What should be transcended? One should transcend the self and [the sense of ] personal possession. What is it to transcend the self and [the sense of ] personal possession? It is to transcend the two Dharmas. What is it to transcend the two Dharmas? It is to be mindful neither of interior nor exterior Dharmas and to practice universal sameness.</p><p class="P4">We also have to let go of attachment to ego and possession. My body, my clothes, my house, my food: this is all ego attachment. And we think these things are all our own possessions. Well then how do we let go of those possessions and that ego? We have to stop seeing things in a dualistic way, imagining a result of gain or loss, win or lose, good or bad. We are always seeing things in this way. Instead, let go of  dualistic views and see things as equal. </p><p class="P4">In the ten precepts, which we have been taught by Bodhidharma, the first precept says, ‘in this deep, true, settled, pure, mind, we will not cut life.’ There are in the Theravadin version of Buddhism, 500 precepts for the monks and 750 for the women. But in the Mahayana, what they emphasize more than following precepts is the way of awakening. That is held highest in importance, because from awakened mind we will naturally act in the way of these ten precepts. The first is to not cut life in any way. The second precept is to not steal. Of course this includes the usual meaning of not taking other people’s things. That is a legal version. But in fact, prior to that, there is not anything that is mine or could be called mine. We recognize the legal side of it, saying don’t take other people’s things. But other people don’t have things either. The real issue is that there is nothing that can be a ‘mine’. In the truest, deep, settled state of mind, there is not one single thing that is mine. Not even our cells stay the same in a way that they can be called mine.</p><p class="P4">Our own cells even, and we call them our own cells, but with 66 billion cells that are always changing, where is there anything that can be called an “I” or a “mine”? As Ikkyu said in his last poem before he died, ‘Today, I return this body, which I have borrowed, all the way up through this day and this month.’ The Heart Sutra speaks about our aggregates, how we are like the cloud gathering from various parts of mists. So, we are only gathered parts, and we are borrowing those parts that we will then return. There is nothing here that is our possession or my thing—not things, not our precious ideas about things, not our fame, not our objects. We have to leave all of these behind when we die. So then, what makes them our possessions? We use Mu and we become Mu, and we see that all things are one in this Mu. We do this Mu from morning until night time, and eventually we lose track of our mind and our body. The floor is Mu, the people sitting around us are Mu, the bell sound is Mu. Everything is Mu. None of the things is mine. There is no me, so there is nothing that could be called a ‘mine’. To actually realize this is zazen.</p><p class="P1">What is universal sameness [equanimity]? It is for self to be same and for nirvana to be same. Why? Both self and nirvana are empty. Why are they empty? They are merely names, and therefore empty. Thus these two Dharmas are without definitive nature. When one attains universal sameness there is no remaining illness. There is only the illness of emptiness, and the illness of emptiness is also empty.</p><p class="P4">What is equanimity? Where there is no more small-self and no more small-self attachment, we let go of our ego. Then, we naturally realize equanimity by having extinguished those flames of greed, those flames of anger, and those flames of delusion. The basic fuel for the awakening of all others is to see things in this way: free of any dualism, and coming from this place where geed, anger, and delusion are extinguished. That is, coming from this void—even the activity of awareness. Even if we want to hurry up and die and get this over with and leave this world behind, if we don’t quickly let go of everything we are attached to, that becomes ego. But that does not mean we can force ourselves in some way to quickly and intensely enter nirvana. We have to loosen our grip on that which believes that we are an ego and that our thoughts have some fixed reality. It is all about whether we are holding our grip tight or loosening our grip. We feel so much pain when we are sick. We just can’t stand feeling all that pain. But that is also ego. When we loosen our grip on the pain we can see that all of that was from our ego view. If we can see this clearly, then we can exchange hell for pain, and how we quickly want to get out of that hell. We pull ourselves further and further into the pain and misery by thinking about a ‘me’ and a ‘my’ and an ‘I’ who is in hell and in pain. It is an ego voice that keeps us going through that. But just knowing that also doesn’t really help. Just knowing it is not the same as knowing how to let go and to realize the place where we are not grasping. We have to see clearly how all this actually works, the whole picture of it, and this is what we learn from being and doing zazen. It shows us how we are so very, very full of attachment—to things and to our thoughts. We can’t stay so scattered. To be able to let go of this we have to let go of being so scattered. We get so panicked, desperately yelling for help, because we are so scattered.</p><p class="P4">Instead, as the Sixth Patriarch has taught us—to everything that we consider external, we have to not add on any thoughts of good or bad. And to everything that is internal, we cannot give further energy to any of those concerns. For doing this we have to use every single one of our 360 smallest joints, our 84,000 hair pores, pouring ourselves into doing this, from the top of our head to the bottom of our feet, and in this way we can bring our scattered-ness and pain-filled body together, into this place where the 360 smallest joints and 84,000 hair pores can gather. But it cannot be done for us by some skilled nurse or skilled doctor. They are not the person who lives in this body. Many like to blame the nurse and the doctor because we have this great pain. They would like to find another place to put that pain. In the same way the person who has wrecked their car would like to blame the mistaken placement of the guard rail. We have brought this all into being. And so we have to take responsibility.</p><p class="P4">We have to sit until we become truly full and taut. It is not about using power and force to do that. It is about using intense concentration and seeing clearly how we are all phenomena. And this is the main point. Were we actually a thing? What are we? What were we? It is not about a religion or a god, but to walk this ground firmly with our own two feet.</p><p class="P4">To not be pulled around by anything within us, but to become one with the heavens and earth. Become one with that true source, that source which feels the pain; we become that very awareness of how that works, not holding on to anything whatsoever. And this is not only for dealing with sickness, but for realizing what the true source is, with not anything being left to hang on to whatsoever. We all have to live in this way, in this birth. And as Vimalakirti says, this is an opportunity.</p><p class="P4">In the <span class="indexTerm">Blue Cliff Record</span> [<span class="indexTerm">Dairyo and the “Dharma-Body”</span>(82)], we have the koan where Master Dairyo is asked by a monk, “The physical body rots away: what is the hard and fast body of reality?” To which Master Dairyo who was a skillful poet, answered,</p><p class="P2">The mountain flowers bloom like a brocade,</p><p class="P2">The river flows blue like indigo.</p><p class="P4">The flowers flying around, dancing in the wind, land on the mountainside like a carpet, like a brocade. The mountains are a rich brocade, a gloriously complete world. This is the pure body of the Dharma. The stream is so full that the water appears not to move. This is the eternal world of our wide-open awareness. We want the blossoms to last forever, but in three days they are gone. They fall with the rain. With one gust of wind, no trace of them remains. At the stream’s edge the water seems to be still, but it’s always flowing, always changing. Yet in the constantly flowing water we can find that world that does not flow at all. The cherry blossoms all of a sudden fall away, but in an instant we discover a world that does not change. This poem of Master Dairyo tells of this sharp aliveness in a single instant. </p><p class="P4">The most terrifying thing about being sick is when we lose hope and we enter hopeless darkness, thinking that nothing will ever get better. When we are sick in this darkness we feel the greatest insecurity— so many people experience this when they are sick. We have to keep our awareness on our huge, great, bright mind. In that brief moment that flies by, we can discover the eternal, but we have to have this sharpness. Within our own person we can find the pure body of the Dharma, the absolute that drinks down the whole universe; we have to discover this there.</p><p class="P4">There is a story by <span class="indexTerm">Akutagawa Ryunosuke</span> who wrote this story in the early 1900s when many were writing deeply spiritual tales. This is a story about <span class="indexTerm">Kandata and a spider’s web.</span> Kandata had lived a worthless life and had fallen into hell. He had fallen into the deep darkness. But one day he was suddenly seen by the Buddha, and for just a split second, hell opened. Kandata was a murderer, but he had also once saved a spider instead of stepping on it. So the Buddha, near the pond where he was sitting, found this spider and sent the spider down into hell on a golden spider web. Just at that second, Kandata happened to look up and spot this golden spider web fiber coming down. He grabbed hold and started to climb. It actually held him. He kept climbing and climbing and climbing, seeing that he might be able to escape from this hell on this fragile thread which was holding him. He was wondering how far he had climbed, and he looked down only to see that many others were also climbing out as well. He got furious and said, ‘Hey, get off! This is my golden thread. Don’t get on this golden thread, it’s going to break!’ Just at that moment the thread broke and he fell back into hell. The Buddha sighed and said ‘Oh, this is so sad, but what can you do about that?’ Then he left.</p><p class="P1">13. “Bodhisattvas who are ill should use non-experience to experience the experiences. They acquire realization without becoming complete in the Dharmas of buddhahood and without extinguishing experience.</p><p class="P4">When bodhisattvas are sick and laying down in bed, how should they hold their mind? First, each person has this idea that we are an ego entity, a personality, a being and a separated individuality. We have to let go of these, and become that place where we are not caught and shut down in thoughts about being a body which is separated and individual. When our state of mind gets perturbed, we can’t stand or sit or do anything comfortably. We have to see that this vessel of a body, which is only a tool, has to be let go of. To see how we are born and die in accordance with karmic affiliations. And then to entrust in the  heavens and earth, to awaken to doing this, and then to let go of our attachment, even to entrusting, because we also have to be clear about our own personal qualities and abilities. And for this we have to let go of that ego stance and ego filter and possessiveness. It’s fine to be natural. But if we don’t throw our small selves away completely, we won’t realize our true nature. And so we have to let go of things such as an ego entity, a personality, an idea of being a being and a separated individuality. We are ultimately void. </p><p class="P4">These ideas of being a being or a personality—they are only kimono, which need food, drink and things to stay alive; but all of these things, the food, drink and kimono, are also originally void. Our sickness is void. That basis of sickness from which everything comes is also void and has no substance. Even our environment is void. Although both pleasure and pain are abandoned when the Buddha qualities are fully accomplished, there is then no sacrifice of the great compassion for all living beings living in the bad migrations. To be able to see all of these things, the sick bodhisattvahas these six activities of awareness—the eyes and ears and the other senses and their functions, all of these six tools—which, when facing outward, perceive. With the eyes, we perceive the things that there are to see. With the ears, we perceive the things that there are to hear. With our nose, we smell things that are to be smelled, we taste what is to be tasted, and we feel things that are actually there. The world is then perceived as a form through these various entrances to consciousness.</p><p class="P4">Each of the six senses has a root or world, each has a perceiving organ, and eachs has a noticing part. We use a past experience which says, ‘that is a flower, that is a stone. That’s a flower, that’s red.’ From there it brings forth imagination, and from imagination comes forth motion. We have a flower that’s red: ‘I would like to put that flower in the zendo; it’s so beautiful’, and then our mental activity begins. These eighteen are all written about in the <span class="indexTerm">Heart Sutra</span>:</p><p class="P3"><span class="textMacron">“no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind, no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no object of mind, no world of eyes, through to no world of mind consciousness.”</span></p><p class="P4">From morning into night we see all kinds of forms, we hear all kinds of sounds, we taste all kinds of flavors. This is because our eyes are empty. They are a lens, simply reflecting. The same is true with the ears and with all of our other senses. With the ears, we hear the wind’s voice or we hear a person’s voice calling. We receive these because our organs are empty. If they were not empty we would not be able to see and hear. We have eyes, but those eyes are empty. We have ears, but those ears are empty. We have a nose, but that nose is empty, a mouth but that mouth is empty, a body, but that body is empty, an awareness, but that awareness is empty. This is what non-sensation is, and so we can perceive.</p><p class="P4">There is nothing difficult about Mu. It is just no thing happening there at all. The flower that we see is <span class="indexTerm">Mu</span> and the fragrance of that flower is Mu. So what is Vimalakirti trying to say? Vimalakirti is saying all this to show that, while there is no actuality to sickness, we still feel terrible. We have to look at this as it is: a phenomena; look at it as just a phenomena and see this very closely.</p><p class="P1">Given the suffering of their bodies, they think of sentient beings in the evil destinations and generate great compassion, [thinking] ‘I have already controlled[my suffering] and I should also control [the suffering] of all sentient beings.’</p><p class="P4">In the path of the Theravadin, many perceptions and feelings are cut away completely, while in the path of the Mahayana it is taught that there is nothing so difficult necessary, only to open all of our senses completely. This is the way of the Mahayana, of the bodhisattva. If we do training that says, ‘don’t see, don’t hear, don’t smell, don’t taste, don’t touch’, how can we live a life in society and for society? We don’t do training that covers everything and puts a lid in it. Rather, we instead see people in society and want to help relieve their suffering as our own. When  we  are sick, to see how widely all of society as a whole is sick, so that we can use our wisdom! We have to not get into a place where we shut down completely all of our senses so that we don’t know the experience that will help us give life to our compassion and help the sickness of society. There is someone in society suffering who is even worse off than I am. How can I possibly help them? We receive the suffering that we have been given, and resolving it for society becomes our determined goal. For those who are in an even worse situation and have even greater suffering, we want to offer our compassion. We feel that compassion, and at that very moment there is a mysterious turning, where our desperate mind is liberated by seeing in this way. The pain which I am now receiving in this sickness, I accept it, and I use this experience to help me offer its wisdom to other people. I will get over this sickness so that all beings are able to make use of this. Here is the wisdom.</p><p class="P1">14. “Just eliminate the illness; do not eliminate Dharmas. [Bodhisattvas] teach [sentient beings] so that they eliminate the basis of their illness. “What is the basis of their illness? It is the presence of discrimination [objectified mentation]. It is through objectified mentation that the basis of illness is constituted.</p><p class="P4">In fact, there is no real thing that is sick. While it is actual that we are in pain, and this large-minded feeling to help others is real and motivates us, we really also hurt. This pain is truly a battle with time. It can get more and more painful. We may not know how long it will stay painful. We may not know whether it will be days or weeks or months. We can’t know. And from this not-knowing, we become dark and resentful. We become angry. We become desperate. It is a fight with time. We have to use various ways to resolve this and to maintain our motivation.</p><p class="P4">When we are working on the front line of things in the world, young and healthy and excited about what we are doing, how quickly time passes. By getting older, retiring from our exciting work, having so much time on our hands, we get restless, and we may even get sick. How do we get through this? People at sesshin here know how to give life to each and every breath totally. To entrust in that all-embracing life energy. For people who are sick, it works to use a mantra, such as chanting the Heart Sutra or the last phrases of the Heart Sutra ‘Gyate, gyate para gyate…’, repeating the Buddha’s name or ‘namu amida butsu’. We can dig into doing that, and it has a big effect. It can’t be done in a superficial or a casual way. It has to go straight through to the very core of the sickness. While sickness has no true substance it has been mentally invented into a substance;. we must see that the fact that we are sick is a phenomena, and what is making us suffer is having thought that this phenomena is real.</p><p class="P4">To deeply realize this, we have to dig into the source of that idea that it is a phenomena. To do this we use sussokan, the counting of the breaths, or the koan <span class="indexTerm">Mu</span>. Because we carry around all kinds of thoughts and ideas we can easily get stuck on some thought like, ‘What good will this do?’ We have to use our sickness and pain as our motivation to go deeply into this.</p><p class="P4">Usually, it is interesting to go out to work in the world, to play in the world, or to do things outside. But being sick, we are trapped on the top of a bed, full of pain, it getting worse and worse and wracking us, and we don’t know when it’s going to be over. This is our teacher. It is an opportunity to learn from within, instead of always going out. Like the keisaku in the zendo, we use the sickness to deepen and deepen, to concentrate our focus. And this is what Vimalakirti is teaching. More and more by doing this we become that sickness, and we become the oneness with the body, the awareness and the sickness. Little by little, it all merges and melts together into the oneness. And in that oneness we forget the pain, we forget the body, and we become our true source. There is nothing to be more thankful for than this becoming of the true source. Our zendo is our bed. We continue until there is no separation between inside and outside, and we see that all of the phenomena is void and empty. In that oneness we forget about our body and our sickness, and we see that this true source exists. This Vimalakirti guarantees us.</p><p class="P4">For those who are sick, Master <span class="indexTerm">Hakuin</span>, in the <span class="indexTerm"><span class="T1">Yasenkanna, Idle Talk on a Night Boat</span></span>, taught the way of <span class="indexTerm">Naikan</span> or “seeing within” method. We lay down after having slept already, when we are well rested, and we place our feet a shoulder’s-width apart. From below our navel in the area of the tanden, which is the center of our ki, we breathe in and exhale from our lower abdomen through our lower back, down the thighs, the calves, the feet, to the very soles of our feet. From the very bottom of the feet we concentrate, and bring our attention and concentration back up and into the tanden, the lower abdomen. We repeat, working with the breath and with the ki/chi, and with repetition we penetrate what Hakuin taught. This is the Muji of Joshu.</p><p class="P4">If our ki gets too high, our head becomes hot, our shoulders become tight, and we feel like we are going to explode. Or we could have a state of mind that feels like we are going to sink and drown. Master Hakuin’s Naikan will be useful for both of these conditions if we practice meticulously. In the doing of this, we will relieve our sickness and realize the true source. See this teaching as precious.</p><p class="P1">“What is discrimination [objectified mentation]? It is the triple world. What is it to eliminate objectified mentation?</p><p class="P1">It is done with nonattainment. “If there is no attainment, there is no objectified mentation. What is nonattainment? It is the transcendence of dualistic views. “What are dualistic views? They are the internalistic view and externalistic view. These are without attainment (i.e., not apprehensible).</p><p class="P4">Next Vimalakirti speaks of the Way of Non-Duality, how there is not two—not to be caught on a version of self as opposed to an other, not caught on a version of a world that is considered to be outside of oneself. People often live a life of deep cultivation while not leaving out the people in the world. We have this koan which says, “The pure person of training does not enter nirvana. The badly behaved bhikkhu does not fall into hell.” By aligning our mind we do not defend and hold onto some self-perceived definition of either of these—not the badly behaved bhikkhu or the pure person of training—because then we would look down upon the badly behaved bhikkhu while raising up the pure person of training. Nor is it about pulling up one and putting down the other of anything. This is the wisdom of a bodhisattva. Nirvana and hell are not two separate things. This is what that Way of Non-Duality is showing us. To see this clearly is a very high level of understanding. Vimalakirti teaches how a bodhisattva should actually be living; this is the teaching of the Way of Non-Duality.</p><p class="P4">In this way we can see that while we have to live amidst many different dualistic perceptions and ideas, to not be muddied by them. No matter what a challenge, what a dirty and muddy challenge we might find ourselves in, to clean ourselves from that like the lotus which blooms from the mud—to be among those challenges but keeping the clear mind of the true bodhisattva who doesn’t get caught on either direction of duality. The source of all of this dualism is delusion and hanging onto a proclaimed idea of a small-self, an “I.” This is why we also hang onto this dream version of a life, believing that it will go on and on. It is because our mind is deluded that we think that way, and that we add on various opinions and thoughts to what we directly perceive.</p><p class="P4">People say they dislike urban society and want to go off into the mountains where it’s quiet and they can really concentrate. But instead, to go right into the society and do it with the state of mind of an empty mirror, simply reflecting whatever is encountered! Even when a mirror reflects water it does not make the mirror wet. Even if a mirror reflects fire, the mirror does not get burned. If we have wisdom, then we will be able to see clearly and clarify in the truth these things that we perceive. Remembering the words of the Sixth Patriarch, who said to not add on any ideas of what is good and bad to what we perceive externally, and internally, no matter what comes up, to not give it any attention whatsoever. To clarify this is the activity of zazen. Even if we are in a world that is operating on dualism, to not be caught in that. We have to not be caught on a single speck of anything.</p><p class="P4">With this absolute deep belief and trust we can experience this world beyond the relative way it is usually perceived, beyond any idea of birth and death. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us. It’s an important teaching which we have to practice and actualize. This is the most honest way of living.</p><p class="P4">In this way Vimalakirti taught, and all of the 8000 bodhisattvas who were listening were completely awakened. Without being afraid of anything in the various layers of the world nor of anything inside, they heard this pure and true teaching. The 500 arhats and the 100,000 heavenly beings were also deeply awakened by these words of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P4">Our true nature which lives within that world of false self and inequality—we can live there in a true way if we go beyond delusive ideas and do not let go of our truthful way of being. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching: living the way that is beyond dualism, that way that is awakened completely; living in that way of the Sixth Patriarch when he tells us to not add on ideas of good and bad to anything that we perceive externally, and internally to not be moved around by whatever concerns there might be. This does not mean to run away from society but to stay right in it and polish that mind by not being moved around by anything that comes along. In this way, by living in society we can polish even better. And to know how to do that, we first have to come and do sesshin—to learn how to do that polishing and live that way in society, to live where we’re not holding on to anything whatsoever, not moved around by anything at all but seeing that from the origin there has never been anything whatsoever.</p><p class="P4">Master <span class="indexTerm">Takuan</span> wrote in his letters to <span class="indexTerm">Yagyu Tajime-no-kami</span> (<span class="indexTerm"><span class="T1">The Unfettered Mind</span></span>), how the main point of living like this is to not be stopped and caught by anything. For doing this we have to give every single bit of our energy and passion to burning completely, with complete intensity to become that oneness. As Master <span class="indexTerm">Mumon Ekai</span> also writes, from the top of our heads to the bottom of our feet we have to give everything to not be pulled around at all, to not be caught and pulled off balance by what we encounter or by what we perceive. This is the essence of zazen. And then we can realize that full tautness that is just like blowing up a balloon: we have to keep going and keep going and keep going until it is totally full and taut. When we can continue without stopping, we see how our mind is when we’re not caught on anything whatsoever. We will then be unmoved by whatever comes along. To realize this and to live in this way, to actualize it—that is what is most important.</p><p class="P1">“Mañjusri, this is how Bodhisattvas who are ill control their minds. This is how they eliminate old age, illness, death, and suffering. This is the Bodhisattva’s bodhi. If it were not like this, then my cultivation would be a foolish waste. It is like one who is victorious over his enemies being called a hero: this is the term for the Bodhisattva who has simultaneously eliminated old age, illness, and death.</p><p class="P4">Of course people have problems, and we all have,  without even knowing it, engaged in  unskillful behavior. We have made serious mistakes again and again in things we have done and in various situations without even knowing it. If we know these mistakes, we have to review our behaviors and look at them clearly. This is the truth of the bodhisattva. To search for this source by looking into our past and blaming others, or being against people, anything like that, is to fall into a great misunderstanding. In this world no matter what unskillful behavior we fall into, no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we absolutely cannot blame that on other people. We have to see clearly that it is not the fault of someone else. If we see it as the fault of someone else, we are caught in our own ego accumulation and confusion. I say it once more, as it was said in the old days: if we resent others, we dig two holes. If we are in a mind of resentment, we are digging two holes.</p><p class="P4">If we are sturdy and healthy in physical body and have never been sick, how can we possibly understand another’s sickness? Only when we ourselves are sick, then for the first time can we understand someone else’s sickness. If we have never been sick ourselves, then when someone else is sick and suffering we cannot understand their state of mind. If we experience that suffering, then for the first time we can be empathetic to another’s suffering. Up  to this point, since we live in a world of actuality, we can understand this thus far. But  we also have the endless past,  full of things that we cannot remember. And we are still carrying around our pain and suffering from the limitless past. Why? Because the mind’s problems are not something that just happen beginning today. Along with this era, these times, all people of the past have given rise to this suffering. People become unfortunate and sick because they cannot live ignoring everything from the past. It all piles up upon itself. If today we look at complex sicknesses and mind’s challenges, we clearly see the various things that have not yet been resolved.</p><p class="P4">In domestic violence, for example,  there is a source in the past for this behavior. Without resolving that, the situation and the behaviors are repeated over and over again. Many situations in the world today are like this. Because humankind did not take care of the problems before, we have problems in the extreme, today. We have to look at our present reality and look at what we have done in the past. We have to ask, “What have I done so unskillfully in the past?” We have to make the effort to look carefully and diligently.</p><p class="P1">15. “Bodhisattvas who are ill should think as follows: ‘If this illness of mine is neither real nor existent, then the illnesses of sentient beings are also neither real nor existent.’</p><p class="P4">In Buddhism, the source of sickness is the “mumyo” or dark ignorance. This is the true source of the darkness of the human mind. This is the murk and the ignorance that murkiness produces, and this results in unresolved problems. We do not get bright, and without resolving that lack of brightness, we continue in ignorance. We put aside the wisdom of true awakening, and we live concerned only with our personal satisfaction in our daily life. We don’t even try to resolve our own faults and don’t use those ingredients to resolve our problems. We seek only our own happiness and, with that, we deepen our own problems and create more and more suffering.</p><p class="P4">The world’s problems with human relationships and distrust have been around for a long time. We must look at where they have been through, or we cannot resolve these problems. The Buddha Dharma is not vague and casual in its way of resolving problems and encouraging peace. It has to be done by resolving the actual dark ignorance of all humankind, or there is no real resolution of the problem.</p><p class="P4">For what am I training and for what is clarifying the human mind? These questions are asked because otherwise there is no resolution of the dark ignorance, and without that resolution we have only partial clarification. Then the problems become more and more complex and confusing.</p><p class="P1">“When performing this contemplation, [such Bodhisattvas] may generate an affectionate view of great compassion with regard to (i.e., sentimental compassion toward) sentient beings, but this should be forsaken. Why?</p><p class="P4">We cannot pity people with sickness, or we make their problems more difficult. Rather, to purify our own mind helps others in their efforts to clarify their mind and gives them hope. If we are pitying them we make their burdens even heavier. Each person’s positive energy is what helps them open into their future of infinite possibilities, and we need to support them in this.</p><p class="P4">If you want to truly resolve the problems of all beings, you have to resolve the sickness of all beings completely. If you do this, then the precepts “do good things” and “don’t do bad things”, are clear. If we do bad things, we can see immediately that we will have a heavy heart, and we hurt other people. If we offer our whole life for others, our mind is free, light and liberated. We can experience this directly. Our mind is pure from the origin. To not leave any lumps and twisted messes in our heart is the true way. We have to not leave any darkness in our mind, to not make problems, and to stay clear. We can always make the effort to stay clear with ourselves and others. We need to clarify the all-embracing mind, to give it life, and help others resolve their problems with that state of mind. If we clarify our own mind, then we can help others to clarify their mind. Doing that is the way to comfort all other bodhisattvas and to make the effort to resolve their suffering.</p><p class="P1">“Bodhisattvas eliminate the vexations of sensory data and generate great compassion. If they have an affectionate view of compassion, they would thereby generate aversion toward samsara. If they are able to transcend this they will not have any [such] aversion, and no matter where they are subsequently reborn they will not be limited by any affectionate view. They will be born without bonds and be able to explain the Dharma to sentient beings and emancipate them from their bonds. “It is as the Buddha has explained: ‘It is impossible for someone with bonds to emancipate others from their bonds. It is only possible for someone without bonds to emancipate others from their bonds.’Therefore, Bodhisattvas should not generate bonds.</p><p class="P4">Because of our ignorance, much suffering comes about. Some part of it is karmic affiliation that was beyond our responsibility and not our own personal problem. In this way we might, for example, receive an injury from a bombing or be involved in a serious crisis and receive a great physical disability. There are many ways of receiving these circumstances which are not only from our own ignorance, not only from our confused past.</p><p class="P4">We receive sickness, injury, and disability in many different ways To not be fearful about it, be against it, or be confused by it is to receive it as our way of life. And to see our way of life in this new way is to revitalize and recommit ourselves to living.</p><p class="P4">When we look at it this way, our sickness is not just suffering. Our pain, disability, and injury encourage us to meet with things we don’t want to encounter. Then we can see how to give these actualities life and see how to make use of them. We transform it into a new sense of how to live. This is about how each person actually is, how they live.</p><p class="P4">Each and every one of us here is alive. This all-embracing Dharma is also alive. If we see from a personal small-self perspective, we feel pathetic, sorry for ourselves, and as if we are receiving great injustice and unfairness. But we have to see it with bigger eyes and receive it within a larger view, without holding on to a small-self-centered sense of things. The Dharma is alive and coming to life. We are constantly being given to, to see it in this way.</p><p class="P1">16. “What are bonds, and what is emancipation?</p><p class="P1">“A desirous attachment to the flavor of meditation is the bond of Bodhisattvas; and birth through skillful means is the emancipation of Bodhisattvas. “Further, to be without skillful means is to have one’s wisdom in bondage, while to have skillful means is to have one’s wisdom emancipated. “To be without wisdom is to have one’s skillful means in bondage, while to have wisdom is to have one’s skillful means emancipated.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti says that while living in the world of life and death, this life full of delusion, be fully in this life and from the bottom of our hearts do not be soaked through by and tainted by delusion. This is to not be confused and to not be moved around</p><p class="P4">Even while realizing Nirvana or experiencing an advanced state of mind, to not try to stay in a simply quiet serene mind is the way of the bodhisattva. This is Vimalakirti’s teaching. </p><p class="P4">When a person’s life is challenging and impoverished, they easily become impoverished to the very bottom of their mind. Even if we are challenged by our life, we must not become impoverished in our state of mind as well. Life, and especially a life that always includes suffering, is often walked with great pain, but that pain must not soak into the bottom of our mind. Life does have suffering, and that clear mind which is needed by everyone—the ability to give them wonder and energy—this kind of brightness must be available. This is the way of the bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">Entering an advanced state of mind, people get stuck there comfortably and lose track of the pain and suffering of others. This very frequently happens. We get caught on wanting to guard our own good fortune and comforts. However, there are those who have no food to eat today; how easily we forget their pain! The state of mind of Nirvana, that serenity, even if we realize it, we can’t sit down and rest there. But we have to offer assistance to the many in society with their confusion and suffering. We have to see clearly how to guide them and light their way and not sit down on our own peaceful state of mind. We have to join with them and help them to become liberated. This is the way of the bodhisattva; this is how our everyday life should be lived.</p><p class="P1">17. “What is it to be without skillful means and one’s wisdom in bondage? It is for Bodhisattvas to use affection to ornament the buddha lands and accomplish [the salvation of] sentient beings, to control oneself within [the three emancipations of ] emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. This is called being without skillful means and one’s wisdom in bondage. “What is it to have skillful means with one’s wisdom emancipated? It is not to use affection to ornament the buddha lands and accomplish [the liberation of ] sentient beings, and to control oneself so as to be without aversion within [the three emancipations of ] emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. This is called having skillful means with one’s wisdom emancipated. “What is it to be without wisdom and have one’s skillful means in bondage? It is for Bodhisattvas to plant a host of virtuous roots while abiding in the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views. This is called being without wisdom with one’s skillful means in bondage.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakirti is talking about the way of the bodhisattva that dives into a soiled world without getting soiled, and dives into a pure world yet does not get caught there nor become proud. This is how the Vimalakirti is teaching us to see this world of the mysterious “not two”. Only in this way can we understand it clearly. No matter how filthy and muddy we become, to not have our life energy sullied by it. This is what he is pointing out. This is his main point.</p><p class="P4">People cannot live only liking pure things and disliking soiled things. We have to welcome soiled and dirty things as well and not look down on them and not pretend to be pure. This is what Vimalakirti dislikes most: to divide and categorize into sage and stupid, saints and sinners,  have awakened and have not awakened; desires and Buddha nature. Creating all of these divisions, we become attached to them, and that is not the point. We need to realize the mysterious way of the “not two”. This is the true path. To dive into the world, yet not to be moved around by the devils there, this is the world of the bodhisattva. It is not about guarding and defending a world or protecting our own <span class="indexTerm">small-self</span> and our personal boundaries. It is to dive into the world of devils and darkness and not be moved around by them. It is to liberate each person. We have to have this kind of courage and bravery, or this world will not be liberated.</p><p class="P4">Do not try to escape from discrimination and dualism. Even if we vow to realize all wisdom, we have to not be in a hurry to complete the way. There is only one truth, and we see this clearly. That is the way of the bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">The twelve links of causation, and to go beyond them, is to also jump into the poisonous karmic affiliations. This is the way of the bodhisattva. To see this way of living of a true person, the core of the eternal truth can then be lived. This burning to share this with all people—this is the truth of the mysterious path of “not two”.“What is it to have wisdom with one’s skillful means emancipated? It is to transcend the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views and plant a host of virtuous roots, rededicating [the merit to one’s achievement of ] anuttara samyaksambodhi. This is called having wisdom with one’s skillful means emancipated.</p><p class="P1">18. “Mañjusri, Bodhisattvas who are ill should contemplate the Dharmas like this:</p><p class="P1">“Also, to contemplate the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and no-self is called wisdom.</p><p class="P1">“Although the body is ill, it always exists in samsara. To benefit all without tiring—this is called skillful means.</p><p class="P1">“Also, in contemplating the body, [one should realize] that the body does not transcend illness and illness does not transcend the body, and that this illness and this body are neither new nor old—this is called wisdom. For one’s body to be ill — but never die is called skillful means.</p><p class="P1">19. “Mañjusri, thus should Bodhisattvas who are ill control the mind. They should</p><p class="P1">not abide within [the controlled mind], and they should also not abide in the uncontrolled mind. Why? To abide in the uncontrolled mind is the Dharma of fools. To abide in the controlled mind is the Dharma of sravakas. Therefore, Bodhisattvas should not abide in either the controlled or uncontrolled mind. To transcend these two Dharmas is the practice of Bodhisattvas. To be within samsara and not undertake polluted practices, to abide in nirvana and never become extinguished: this is the practice of Bodhisattvas.</p><p class="P4">Once a monk asked Master Joshu, “All the ten thousand things return to the One; where does the One return to?” [<span class="indexTerm">Blue Cliff Record</span>, <span class="indexTerm">Chau Chou’s Seven Pound Cloth Shirt (45)</span>]</p><p class="P4">All existence in this whole world returns to the absolute One, but to where does this One return? Everything is Amida Butsu’s Oneness and to this it all returns, to the true oneness of the Dharma Ocean. If we say it in a Zen way, all of the ten thousand things are returning to the one Mind. Today’s science would say all things return to energy. Up to this point, if you open your mouth you will understand it without fail. Anyone can say this and does, so it seems easy to understand. But really, where, after all, is this One that it returns to? This monk was seeking seriously and to this degree.</p><p class="P4">It is all too possible that we can end up like <span class="indexTerm">Daito Kokushi</span> who said that for thirty years he was stuck in a <span class="indexTerm">wild fox’s cave</span>. All things return to this One, but if we sit down on that One or on that Mu and don’t have any way of moving on, that is like all bus drivers stopping at just one stop. That is nihilistic death and destruction. All things return to the One, where is that one? If we do a little zazen we know how all things return to One, but where does that One go? We have to find out where that One goes or we will be turning our backs on society. This monk’s question is sharp and cannot be answered lightly.</p><p class="P4">Joshu answered this question: “When I was in Seishu I had a jacket made and it used <span class="indexTerm">seven pounds of flax</span>.” Seishu was Joshu’s home country. He said that he had gone to his home country and had a jacket made and it was only 3700 grams, very light and warm. Can it be said that Master Joshu answered honestly or that he did not answer honestly? There almost seems to be no connection between the question and the answer.</p><p class="P4">It is said that our mind is our action, that Buddha nature is our functioning. As Master Rinzai put it, “When it meets our eyes it is seeing, when it meets our ears it is hearing, when it meets our mouth it is tasting, when it meets our hands it becomes carrying and when it meets our feet it becomes walking.” To work brightly and swiftly is our True mind and our original mind is empty and void, but if we just stop there we are destroyed. If  “all of the things return to One” is only a “one” of intellectual understanding, it doesn’t work. To die completely is the way of Zen and then that “one” that all returns to is realized. That is the “one that is many, and the many that is one”, and this has to be experienced, not just explained with words.</p><p class="P4">Of course if all people return to God it has to be an experience of that God, not just an idea. If all things return to One it has to be that actual One, the Buddha nature. If all returns to energy, if all phenomena return to energy and are born and transform and return, this is also an expression of it. If all things return to the One, it has to be our everyday activity and not just a “One” in our imagination.</p><p class="P4">All people are for One, One is for all people. This way of looking at it is the truth of society. It has to be received as that. God and Buddha or some absolute is not what we return to, but all people are one person and one person is all people, and in each person an absolute worth is realized and found. This is where the truth of Buddhism is found. In this person there is an absolute worth and path—this is Zen.</p><p class="P4"><span class="indexTerm">Joshu</span> said to a monk who asked about all things <span class="indexTerm">returning to One</span>, that of course One returns to all things. He didn’t ignore that but he did not sit down on it either. Of course all things returning to the One is his experience, and he also knew that this One was what gives life to all things in our everyday world, beyond all explanations. This is  Joshu’s point.</p><p class="P4">“I was in Seishu and had a jacket made, it took 7 lbs of flax.” Joshu is not attempting any kind of an explanation but rather digging into the actuality of the question. “I was in Seishu and had a jacket made, warm and light, it only took 7 lbs of flax.”</p><p class="P4">The truth of that One is the truth of all things. This is what gives radiance to our every day life, and this is also the truth of Joshu. All explanations and words and intellectualization are thrown away, and there is Zen’s vivid living state of mind. This clear and full state of mind is the state of mind of Joshu.</p><p class="P1">20. i) “It is neither the practice of ordinary [unenlightened persons] nor the practice of the wise and sagely: this

class="P1">When Vimalakirti explained [the Dharma] in these words, eight thousand Bodhisattvas within the great assembly led by Mañjusri all generated the intention to achieve anuttara samyaksambodhi.</p><p class="P4">In this way Vimalakirti tells us and the whole assembly, gods and bodhisattvas all. This then gave rise to their awakened mind. To bring this possibility to all beings is what Vimalakirti taught, and for doing this, Vimalakirti was a true bodhisattva.</p><p class="P4">In this chapter, the source of humans’ sickness is being clearly shown: it is in our mind and in our lack of awakening. To see ourselves as the center of things is what makes us deluded. The source of that is the ego and being centered on ourselves. To feel that pain is what makes us sick. This is the sickness we have. To realize the pain of all beings is what causes the bodhisattva’s sickness. The greatest weakness of society today is being ignorant and unawakened and caught on our ego. </p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
