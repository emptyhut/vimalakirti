At this time Śakra Devānām Indra, who was in the great congregation, announced to the Buddha, “World-honored One, although I have listened to a hundred thousand sutras by yourself and Mañjuśrī, I had never heard this scripture of the definitive true characteristic of the inconceivable, autonomous, numinous penetration.</p><p class="P3">In Hinduism it is thought the heavenly Gods commanded the caste system to be put in place, while Buddha always taught the equality of all beings. Not a hierarchy of some being above and some being below. It is an important teaching of the Buddha that humans come from cause and effect, not from the commanding of some God. Instead, no beginning and no ending, not created by a God or an absolute power. It is by karmic affiliation that we connect and influence. </p><p class="P3">When we awaken to our true nature, we can make a society of true equality. The Buddha is of wisdom, he’s not moved around by decrees of external gods. The Buddha was born in the warrior class of the caste system but he grasped that it was not worthwhile to be involved in any hierarchy. Rather he deepened his wisdom, not trying for the worldly goods his high caste would bring him. He never rested on his achievements. In his entire lifetime he always taught and lived the Dharma. Not in a narrow doctrinal way, but through teaching us that we use our own senses directly to intuitively perceive this world. </p><p class="P3">If we are seeing in this way we only have to use this life to purify. While we are all born pure, we get conditioned, attached and stuck, and we have to return to our pure original unattached mind and its truth. Not by blindly obeying orders of how to be, but to always live in the Dharma with our minds pure. This is the special flavor of Buddhism. </p><p class="P2">2. “According to my understanding of the meaning explained by you, if there are sentient beings who hear this sutra and who devoutly understand, accept and maintain, and read and recite it, they will definitely attain this Dharma, and will not doubt it. How much more so if they cultivate according to its explanation! Such people will immediately close off the host of evil destinations and open the gateways of good. They will always be protected and remembered by the buddhas. They will subjugate the heterodox teachings and demolish the vengeful Māras. They will cultivate bodhi and reside peacefully in the place of enlightenment. They will walk in the very footsteps the Tathāgata has trod. </p><p class="P3">Here Sakra Indra (Taishaku) says to Buddha that he has never heard such an excellent teaching as this of Vimalakirti, and that he will always spread this without fail. Thereby others will be able to use the truth of Vimalakirti’s instructions in everything they do, in order to purify their state of mind and to liberate others. </p><p class="P3">We must deeply believe these teachings, whether we understand them or not. They are not to be blindly accepted and just received unconditionally. Rather, we are to make use of them to purify and awaken our mind. The obstructions and sickness we have from not purifying our mind will then be freed and released. We can see how without purifying our mind we will be coming from a place of self-attachment only. And Vimalakirti teaches us how to let go of that as well. We see how anyone can understand by listening within and cultivating these teachings. We learn by aligning our daily life with these teachings. </p><p class="P3">These teachings will cut off all possibility of an unhappy life; they will open the way to a fortunate life. Practitioners will be looked after by all the manifestations of the Buddha; they will overcome all adversaries and will defeat all devils. Hearing these teachings correctly, do not be afraid, be free from obstruction – there are always those who are living these teachings and we will be able to learn from them and offer what we have gained to all beings.</p><p class="P3">The heretic, meaning those who follow a path that believes in a seeking externally, may change to the way of internal purification, becoming like a mirror that reflects perfectly. A hating person will see themselves hating and be taught by seeing this that they have to let go of their attachments. This world is a mirror and we are often deceived by what we see. Because we are so full of attachments ourselves we are in pain, and seeing into this we are able to purify and correct our obstructive views and assist others in correcting their obstructive views.</p><p class="P3">We have infinite past experiences over many lives. How many experiences….countless….Not having a pure mind, because we sought to benefit ourselves above others in all of those past lives. Now, we purify our mind. Letting go of our egoistic view, we can bring forth what we have gained from facing our past. No needing to erase all of our past, we can use what is most important from our past and bring it forth. This is the Buddha’s wisdom. </p><p class="P3">Here is a very important aspect of Buddhism in the Buddhist teaching: use the ego when it is necessary and not otherwise, and be able to see that difference. Therefore the importance of Zen is right here and now, and not to be confused with the teachings of gods or with the ideas of devils. Thoughts such as these come from an insecure mind. When we see, realize and realign our mistaken mind, then we can teach a true way of purification. When we work with this process of purifying wherever we go, then every step we take and every place we are is the dojo. </p><p class="P3">We need a dojo at the beginning as a place to learn a true way of purifying and being in our experience. We have to do the practice in our mind as part of our everyday life as well. Everyone comes here with families and jobs, and when you all come here a dojo is created. The Buddha awakened and taught this for all people: offer effort to the good fortune of all beings, before thinking of your own. We work to purify our mind so that it becomes a refuge for all. </p><p class="P2">3. “World-honored One, if there are those who accept and maintain, read and recite, and cultivate [this sutra] as it has explained, I and my subordinates will make offerings and serve them.</p><p class="P3">Here we have the king of the Heavens, Taishakuten, declaring that these words of Vimalakirti Sutra will from now on forward be taught and recited.</p><p class="P2">“As to the villages, towns, mountain forests, and wildernesses where this sutra is found, I and my subordinates will go to those locations in order to listen to the Dharma. I will cause those who do not yet believe to believe, and those who already believe will be protected.” </p><p class="P3">The god Taishaku, the god of all the gods, then says that he and all of his court will serve those who train in such a way.</p><p class="P3">Of course, this is also about opening a dojo. In the beginning, the dojo of Tahoma was a forest. First unknown, now look at how many come and learn to purify their state of mind. Of course, our state of mind changes, and everyone can learn through this too. We change, Tahoma changes; we change, the environment also changes. This is true in every place where people are gathering to practice- it comes to feel like a holy, sacred place. Returning home after being here, we are returning with a clarified state of mind. Being here in the sacred place we can easily purify. Even if it is only for one week, we can find a way to free our mind and take this home with us.</p><p class="P3">The king of the Taishaku heavens is saying there should be these kinds of places everywhere. People can learn how to clarify their mind in this environment, and these sacred places will become a refuge. More of them should be built everywhere.</p><p class="P2">4. The Buddha said, “Excellent, excellent! Heavenly emperor, it is as you have spoken. I am happy for you!</p><p class="P3">  The Buddha agrees and says indeed, this teaching is the source of refuge for all beings and is of great importance for all generations to come. </p><p class="P2">“This sutra extensively explains the inconceivable anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi of the buddhas of the past, present, and future. Therefore, heavenly emperor, if good men and women accept and maintain, read and recite, and make offerings to this sutra, that is tantamount to making offerings to the buddhas of the past, present, and future. </p><p class="P3">As in the Diamond Sutra, the Buddha instructs us to do zazen to attain our most clear state of mind.. This is truth for humankind. Since the king of heaven says all of these great things about the sutra, the Buddha praises him. </p><p class="P3">Humans are always able to realize this purity at any time. As we take our egoistic self-centered view and purify it, we can realize our human wisdom, and we can experience perfect awakening. This most excellent truth about the purity of our mind does not change in any era. This is the Clear mind where there is no ego. Within this mind, all beings are free. </p><p class="P3">When we are born there is no ego. We become conditioned to have an egoistic view. If we ceaselessly work on our pure mind, we can clarify this. For this we have our zazen. The mysterious awakening which pierces through past, present and future, that same awakening of all buddhas, this is what is important to realize. In this way, our Clear mind is ultimately purified. The Buddha says he will protect and guard those who abide in this, and guarantees that he will always bring them the deepest awakening.</p><p class="P3">The Buddha says that all people who are training will succeed in their efforts to go beyond the impurities of the ego filter. But we have to make the effort necessary to realize this purification, individually and together. All of the past, present, and future Buddhas are supporting this and working at it with us. The Roshi has now come to America every year for the past 25 years straight. He has made many, many deep connections with people through meeting and teaching in the world of Zen. A dojo is a place for people to be taught to train themselves and to train others. We are using Tahoma for doing this important work. There are things we can’t do alone, which is why we join with others in making the effort to practice together in order to find the deep truth in everything we see. We encourage one another to be ceaseless in our efforts so that we may bring out this great wisdom in all beings. This is our offering to the Buddha.</p><p class="P4">5. “Heavenly emperor, even if the entire trimegachiliocosm were filled with Tathāgatas as numerous as the sugar cane, bamboo, reeds, rice, hemp, and forests, and if a good man or woman were to revere, honor, praise, make offerings, and provide all their needs for a kalpa or even less than a kalpa, until after the nirvana of those Tathāgatas;</p><p class="P3">This immense universe, which is a thousand times multiplied by a thousand times the size of our own sun’s galaxy, is beyond imagination and meant to be that way. But now, even science agrees with these dimensions. This immense universe is one Buddha Land, and there is one Buddha. If we simply chant the Buddha’s name for one recitation, we can enter the furthest corner of this billion world galaxy. This billion world galaxy is a metaphor for the infinite world of Buddha Wisdom. </p><p class="P2">“After [the nirvana of those Tathāgatas], if he or she erected a stupa of the seven treasures above the relics of every one of those Tathāgatas’ bodies, as long and wide as a single fourfold world and as tall as the Brahmā heaven, [with each stupa constituting] a field ornamented with all [manner of] flowers, incense, garlands, banners, and musicians, paramount in most subtle wonder;</p><p class="P3">One kalpa is the measure of time it would take for a 40 cubic meter stone to be worn away by a heavenly being coming down once every one hundred years, dancing in her feathered robe. Once every one hundred years, just the tip of her sleeve brushes that stone. The length of time it would take for this huge rock to be worn away is one kalpa, also known as one aeon. And then the Buddha added, <span class="T1">“</span>What do you think, prince of gods? Would that noble son or daughter receive much merit as a consequence of such activities?”</p><p class="P2">“If [that good man or woman] made offerings to [these stupas] for a kalpa or less than a kalpa— </p><p class="P2">“What do you think, heavenly emperor? Would the blessings planted by that person be great or not?” </p><p class="P2">Śakra Devānām Indra said, “They would be great, World-honored One! One could not fully explain their merit, even in a hundred thousand koṭis of kalpas.” </p><p class="P3">And of course, these activities must be for the best fortune of all beings. So how much merit is there, could there be in this? The Diamond Sutra also has this kind of description that is beyond the measurable.</p><p class="P2">6. The Buddha told the heavenly emperor, “You should understand, the good man or woman who hears this scripture of the inconceivable emancipation and who devoutly understands, accepts, recites, and practices it will have blessings even greater than the former person.</p><p class="P2">I got this far, but the stupa part has me stumped! One sutra was duplicated and I cut it out….</p><p class="P2">“Why? The enlightenment of all the buddhas is born from this. The characteristic of bodhi is immeasurable, and based on this the blessings are immeasurable.” </p><p class="P3">Again the same way of immeasurable expression found in the Diamond Sutra is being given here. Sharing a four line gatha or an instruction in inconceivable liberation is far greater in importance than any material offering. Even yet beyond that is actualizing these teachings and realizing them through one’s direct awakening. The Buddha continues always reciting, experiencing, sharing with others, becoming it, because it is from that wisdom that all the buddhas are born forth. </p><p class="P3">Not a conceptual “Buddha” rather one who is as Master Rinzai has taught, a being who has realized the dharmakaya, the clean pure light in a moment of your mind. The sambogakaya, the undifferentiated light in a moment of your mind. The nirmanakaya, the undiscriminating light, in a moment of our mind. </p><p class="P3">From the time we were born, we gathered data and formed an ego from that data. But we have to return to a state of zero. These three kayas are prior to that ego filter, prior to any reasoning, prior to any conceptualization. Not to do zazen with a head full of thinking but with a state of mind of letting go completely. This is the state of mind of the dharmakaya, the mind of the great perfect mirror wisdom, from which all functioning manifests. </p><p class="P3">If we don’t perceive in a way that is limited by our judgements and our mental ideas, we truly hear people’s deepest pain as it really is. This is the true perception of the Buddha-to see and hear and smell and taste and experience with not a single idea or opinion added to that perception whatsoever. </p><p class="P3">The clear pure light in a moment of our mind: not to see with any dualism, but see everything exactly as it is, to see things clearly as they are before dualistic perception arises. Seeing a flower, becoming that flower-this is how we experience the truth of the universe directly. This is the merit of the Vimalakirti Sutra, that offering a pure mind is the greatest offering to the Buddha.</p><p class="P2">7. The Buddha told the heavenly emperor, “At a time immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of kalpas in the past, there was a buddha named Medicine King (Bhaiṣajyarāja), a Tathāgata, Arhat, Fully Enlightened One, One Endowed with Wisdom and Conduct, Well-gone One, Knower of the World, Supreme Master of Discipline, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, and World-honored One. His world was called Great Ornamentation. His kalpa was called Ornamentation. </p><p class="P3">In infinite kalpas past, in the infinite future, meaning that there is no beginning nor any end to this world, that cause and effect create further cause and effect. Yet before any of that there was a Buddha named Bhaisajyaraja, or Sesson Butsu and here it tells what wisdom and what character such a  Buddha had. Wisdom to realize everywhere, always in an enlightened state of mind, a knower of the world to guide others as is necessary. Incomparably excellent character, as well as a disciplined way of life, a teacher of gods and men. </p><p class="P2">“That buddha’s lifespan was twenty small kalpas. </p><p class="P2">“He had a śrāvaka sangha of thirty-six koṭis of nayutas [of members], and a bodhisattva sangha of twelve koṭis. </p><p class="P2">“Heavenly emperor, at the time there was a wheel-turning sage king named Jeweled Canopy, who was endowed with the seven treasures [of the cakravartin] and ruled the fourfold world. The king had one thousand sons, who were handsome, courageous, and able to subjugate their enemies. </p><p class="P2">8. “At the time Jeweled Canopy and his subordinates made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata, providing all that he needed for a full five kalpas. After five kalpas he told his thousand sons, ‘You should also make offerings to the Buddha with a profound mind, like me.’ Then the thousand sons, accepting their father’s order, made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata, and they provided for his needs for another full five kalpas. </p><p class="P3">Yakuyo Nyorai had a life span of twenty kalpas and had thirty-six million billion disciples and bodhisattvas who were trained by him. There was also a monarch named King Ratnacchattra who guarded everyone’s peace and great good fortune. This monarch was very wealthy and had one thousand children who were all courageous and worked hard to keep the country well. This King Ratnacchattra honored the Tathagatha and in this way that he honored the Tathagatha after five aeons and his time was over, he said to his children, his one thousand children, that they should also worship him. </p><p class="P2">9. “One of those sons, named Moon Canopy, sat alone, thinking ‘Might there be some offering that would exceed even this?’ </p><p class="P2">“Through the Buddha’s numinous power, a god’s voice was heard from space, ‘Good man, the offering of the Dharma surpasses all other offerings.’ “[Moon Canopy] then asked, ‘What is an offering of the Dharma?’”</p><p class="P3">And then he asked them, <span class="T1">“</span>What is this “Dharma-worship”</p><p class="P2">“The god said, ‘You may go ask Medicine King Tathāgata. He will give you an extensive explanation of offerings of the Dharma.’ Prince Moon Canopy immediately proceeded to Medicine King Tathāgata and bowed to his feet, then stood to one side and addressed the Buddha, ‘World-honored One, of all the offerings, offerings of the Dharma are superior. What are offerings of the Dharma?’</p><p class="P2">10. Buddha [Medicine King] said, “Good man, offerings of the Dharma are those made to the profound sutras explained by the buddhas</p><p class="P3">If you want to know this then ask Hyakuyo Nyorai, he will tell you correctly. He went and did correct prostrations to Hyakuyo Nyorai and asked his question, <span class="T1">“</span>What is Dharma-worship?”  And he was then answered, the teachings of the Buddha, to experience them well, chewing them thoroughly and to experience these teachings as the way to pure mind, not to conceptualize them but to realize them with this pure mind, live them and not go into a mental state about them. </p><p class="P2">“In all the worlds, these are difficult to believe in, difficult to accept. They are subtle and difficult to see, pure and without defilement. They cannot be attained with only discriminative thinking. “They are contained in the storehouse of the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. </p><p class="P3">In our chanting, if we add on any of our own personal interest, we cannot purify. But in the dharani chanting which is what being written about with these words, there is no placing of our own personal state of mind. There are many dharani and all of them are for entering Samadhi. As is written in the Song of Zazen by Hakuin, <span class="T1">“</span>How much more so then if on reflecting within ourselves, we directly realize self-nature, giving proof to the truth that self-nature is no nature. We will have gone far beyond idle speculation.”  This is all the practice of the Mahayana. For those who live in the world, with families, with jobs while having a self cultivate Samadhi to forget that self completely.</p><p class="P3">As the Sixth Patriarch has said in his definition of zazen, <span class="T1">“</span>To add on no idea of good or bad or anything to what we perceive. To hold no concerns within. Forgetting personal benefit completely.”  We forget our small self. And like one who dances on the stage, is not at all thinking about or concerned with whether their body approves of their dancing or not while they are doing it. The dancer is only absorbed in the dancing totally. This state of mind is true functioning, yet this is not possible unless everything is let go of totally. Otherwise everything becomes a way of looking away from our focus. We have to keep that focus, that way of entering Samadhi in everything we do-without thinking about meaning and preference. </p><p class="P1">“As for the Mahayana practice of zazen there are no words to praise it fully. The six paramitas, giving, maintaining the precepts, various other good deeds, like invoking the Buddha’s name, repentance and spiritual training, all finally returning to this.”  </p><p class="P3">This way of entering Samadhi is the core of all training. Without Samadhi, none of it is actual training. Whether it is painting or any art or practice,it has to enter this world of Samadhi. And dharanis are what cultivate Samadhi. There is no meaning to a dharani. It purifies our mind as we forget ourselves completely, that is the Dharma worship. And here what is most important is that compassion comes forth from this like a mirror, we reflect exactly what comes in front of us with nothing else entering in. A sad person comes in front of a mirror, a sad person is precisely reflected. This is true because of our purified mind. And this comes, and is possible because of our Samadhi. </p><p class="P2">They are sealed by the seal of dhāraṇī. They take one to [the stage of] nonretrogression and to the accomplishment of the six perfections. </p><p class="P2">“They discriminate the meanings well, and they accord with the dharma of bodhi. They are supreme among the host of sutras and induct one into great sympathy and compassion. They transcend the affairs of the hosts of Māras and the various heterodox views. They accord with the dharma of causes and conditions. </p><p class="P3">There are all kinds of people in the world, challenging, difficult, mistaken, but live in the right way of things in this state of mind. They’re not moved around by any of those. This is the Dharma-worship. </p><p class="P2">10. Buddha [Medicine King] said, “Good man, offerings of the Dharma are those made to the profound sutras explained by the buddhas. “In all the worlds, these are difficult to believe in, difficult to accept. They are subtle and difficult to see, pure and without defilement. They cannot be attained with only discriminative thinking. “They are contained in the storehouse of the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. </p><p class="P2">They are sealed by the seal of dhāraṇī. They take one to [the stage of] nonretrogression and to the accomplishment of the six perfections. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha is telling this to the Taishaku king that for us to always be forgetting ourself, matching each situation perfectly, this is the Dharma-worship. Whether chanting of the mantra, chanting of the Buddha’s name, or zazen-doing it with our whole body. We forget our body, forget our thinking, this is the Dharma-worship. To please not do a zazen of form only, but to let go of all of the concepts and the ideas and the extraneous thinking. And then in our work, in our family life, and everything that we do in the world as well, comes to be done in Samadhi. There, anywhere, everywhere, not falling into the way of conceptualization, this is the Dharma-worship.</p><p class="P3">Our zazen is a dharani. Chanting the Buddha’s name, Namu Amida butsu, is a dharani. Nomu ho renge kyo is a dharani. Gyate gyate paragyate parasamgyate bodhi svaha is a dharani. When we chant <span class="T1">“</span>namu ami dabu,” we lose track of our small self completely. And we become the dharani. Our ignorant with this, our ignorant body brings forth the Buddha mind.</p><p class="P3">The Buddha is become completely when we are absorbed into this dharani. And this is zazen. As Daruma Daishi has defined it, <span class="T1">“</span>Letting go of all of our connections to anything external. And dropping all concerns within. When our mind is like a tall strong wall, then wherever we are, we are at one with the true path.”  This is the first definition of zazen. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">Buddha</span>’s wisdom came forth from his deep Samadhi experience and his zazen. This wisdom was first put into words by Daruma Daishi. In his writing called, <span class="T1">“</span>Two-fold entrance into the path.”  Niso Eka Daishi at the beginning, followed that definition of zazen that was given by Bodhidharma. To cut away all access to anything external and let go of any concerns within, he asked Daruma Daishi if he was doing it right to be doing it that way. But Daruma Daishi would never answer him. Niso Daishi, thought he understood it, yet Daruma Daishi never answered him. He continued until he suddenly realized this was not about words, was not about any definition about inside and outside and letting go, and a tall wall. It was about a way of becoming directly that state of mind. </p><p class="P3">If in our zazen we are still caught thinking about our breath and our body, it is not zazen. To forget the body, forget the breathing, to forget it all, the surroundings, if not like that then it is not zazen. Niso Eka Daishi experienced this and for the first time Daruma Daishi acknowledged what he was doing. If we are still caught on our breath and our body, that is not it. We have to dive completely to all of those. And then without fail a new fresh awareness is formed.</p><p class="P3">In the case of Master Joshu and the question of whether a dog has a Buddha nature or not, Mumon Ekai Zenji writes in this case of how to do this kind of zazen and how to work with this koan. He tells us in the commentary, <span class="T1">“</span>We have to use every one of the 360 smallest bones in our whole body. We have to use 84,000 hair pores, only then, if with our entire body and being, we give rise to this great doubt of what is mu?”  [see Gateless Gate (1)]</p><p class="P3">Not with a nihilistic idea and not with an idea there is a something that could be the answer. But continously asking that question, from morning until night, night until morning. We continue in every moment of the day, this mu is held and our conditioning drops away, our attachments drop away, our ideas  all drop away. It is as if we have a red hot iron ball right in our mouth, we cannot spit it out. We cannot swallow it down. All we can do is continue. We continue and we continue, dropping it all away. Letting go of every bit of it. Until we realize this place where there is no longer any inside or outside, this is the state of mind where there is no small self left. </p><p class="P3">We become like a mute, a person who physically can’t speak but has had a dream, but can’t tell anybody that dream because there’s no way to put it into words. This is the way the experience affects us. Our body is no longer in our awareness nor are our thoughts in our awareness. In this way we are like a person who is mute trying to tell their dream. </p><p class="P3">A state of mind where there is nothing left whatsoever. This is not being stuck in a dark place. But this is not yet the whole picture either. From deeply dying in this way of letting go of everything, we are reborn and from there the Buddha’s wisdom is manifested. </p><p class="P3">We sit for this huge great irreversible human radical revolution and this is the Dharma-worship. We work for this in our zazen then our Buddha wisdom is free to manifest. In every sitting we work for this. </p><p class="P3">We sit one period of zazen and we become one incense stick of a Buddha. We sit many, many periods of zazen and we become many incense stick size of Buddha. We don’t sit down as an ignorant person and keep up a dualistic conversation with ourselves. We have to put all of that away and use a mantra for the breath. To be free and let go of all dualism. Each breath is what does this. </p><p class="P3">We then work with koan, to realize that Buddha wisdom. There are 1,700 or more koans. Each and every koan has a different purpose and its own very specific awakening. If we realize these koans then we can work in society simply because we are not smack in the middle of all of the ideas of distinctions. We are not moved around at all. </p><p class="P3">First is not to be caught on anything extraneous. Most important is to not add on any thinking to any of it, any perception, any moment. Or as the great Daito Kokushi has said, <span class="T1">“</span>It has to be like we are sitting on the busiest bridge of the third and fourth street in Kyoto and sitting there as if there’s not, and these people are passing by all the time, sitting as if there is not a single person going by. Only becoming each and every moment in activity completely. We are born like this but we have added on thoughts and data and ideas for each of us. And so it gets confusing. And this is why we have to purify it to where we are not trying for our own benefit. </p><p class="P3">People may say, we can’t work in society without trying to make something for our own benefit. Then what is the point?  But if we think we cannot live without such dualistic mind, we have to experience this place where all of our dualistic tendencies are let go of. We lose our ability to live intuitively when we are only ever living through our dualism. To see this clearly and do zazen and see how deeply we can believe in each other in the deepest way. Zazen is not for raising anti-social people, but to realize and believe in that equal deep mind in all others. This is the Dharma offered through Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P2">“They discriminate the meanings well, and they accord with the dharma of bodhi. They are supreme among the host of sutras and induct one into great sympathy and compassion. They transcend the affairs of the hosts of Māras and the various heterodox views. They accord with the dharma of causes and conditions. </p><p class="P3">All of the buddha’s teachings are about cause and effect. If we plant a good seed, we get a good plant. When we do something bad without fail, it comes back to us. We sit here for a week and we become a bright clear state of mind. We polish as a result of that. We brighten. This is how our mind works. </p><p class="P3">There are so many complex matters going on in society all the time. To not be mixed up in these but allow our mind to be purified so we can see so much more clearly. To see how things work clearly, just as it says the first two stanzas of the Dhammapada, “We are what we think, having become what we thought. At the wheel that follows the cart pulling ox, sorrow follows an evil thought. We are what we think, having become what we thought. Like the shadow that never leaves one, happiness follows a pure thought.”  To not make our minds complex and full of various things, rather to bring into being the causes which then bring forth good results. This is a matter of karmic affiliation that things become as if we have planted them. So to follow that law. This is a law of how all things work. And with that we will have good results. This is also a dharma offering. </p><p class="P2">11. “They are without self, without person, without sentient being, without lifespan. They [teach the three emancipations of] emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness and nonactivation. </p><p class="P2">“They are able to make sentient beings take their seat in the place of enlightenment and turn the wheel of the Dharma. </p><p class="P2">“They are praised by all the gods, dragons, [demonic] spirits (yakṣas), gandharvas, and so on. </p><p class="P2">“They are able to make sentient beings enter the store[house] of the Buddha-Dharma. </p><p class="P3">To not make our mind complex. This was taught over and over again by the Buddha and in that four ways of being a person which are given here, that way of not seeing ourselves as a self, a being, a life or a soul. Instead, not narrowing our idea of what it is to be a living person that is what is being said here. Over and over again, in place after place, the Buddha said the same thing. </p><p class="P3">To see clearly, and with that clarity align things that are happening in the world, not leaving them in a mistaken way just because it is easy. Because we are human we have certain wisdom. It isn’t always respected by every living being. But offer this wisdom to all living beings, for this abundant wisdom has to be seen and offered not just with human’s good fortune. </p><p class="P3">Not each and every one out for their own benefit or else we are not able to be in that equal state of mind around each other. This means to not be caught and not be stuck in our small minded version of how things work. In this, it is important to see the big picture letting go of the idea of being a self, or being a being, or being a life or being a soul. The Buddha says this, take the whole thing for the benefit of all society and not just for a special personal part. This is the Dharma-worship.</p><p class="P2">“They accommodate all the [types of] wisdom of the worthies and sages. They explain the path practiced by the host of bodhisattvas. They rely on the meanings of the true characteristic of the dharmas. They illuminate the dharmas of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and extinction. </p><p class="P3">In this way, also our zazen as it says in the Heart Sutra, from the very origin there was never any birth or death, in the same way that a mirror does not burn up from reflecting fire. </p><p class="P3">We analyze the emotions so we have to go deep until we simply reflect, this is the master within the master. Only the reflecting only is taking place. There is only  that clear eye seeing everything equally. We will all die so we have to see clearly while we are still alive. We have to open this deeply seeing eye. </p><p class="P3">This is the point most specifically made in the Heart Sutra. See that all of this, no matter what we may encounter, every single bit of it is phenomena just as the Heart Sutra is telling us that it is all emptiness. </p><p class="P3">The 84,000 bodhisattvas showed this when they came to the four and a half tatami sized room of Vimalakirti, where he was lying sick. It doesn’t get simpler than that. That’s why that room was so small. And why he was there in that room. He stayed there alone in that small room and yet 84,000 bodhisattvas could fit in there. And with this huge mind that reaches the furthest expanses of the universe that we all are endowed with from the origin. But if you get caught on ideas and opinions and preferences then we just get narrow. </p><p class="P3">The point of doing zazen  is only realize that huge mind. To sit where there is only one in the whole universe. But if our mind is not zero we are not empty, and if we are empty, then no matter what comes, we don’t get entangled and moved around by it. People of great mindedness don’t get angry. They don’t get upset. Realize the state of mind that holds on to nothing. We are appearing as a man, a woman, young, old, sick or healthy, however, our mind is what uses all of these. Yet our mind originally is without any form whatsoever. We can’t misunderstand this. We have to see this clearly. Rather we have to become this clearly. As it was put so well by the poet Masaokoshiki. On his death bed he wrote this poem:</p><p class="P1">The gourd flower is blooming.<br/>The phlegm is all stuffed up.<br/>Is this the Buddha?</p><p class="P3">If we are looking at him and feeling sorry, that is missing the point. He’s looking at himself so objectively at this very final last minute of his life. The gourd flower blooms. The phlegm in my throat is all stuffed up. Is this the Buddha?</p><p class="P3">Masaokoshiki is a man who did a lot of zazen. Today people ask  what is there to live for? They don’t see that though our bodies may die, our wisdom lives on. And that is why it is so important for us to have a clear awareness. We have billions of cells and they are dying and being born. We change every instant, and yet we get caught. If we think about all the things that are going on, we just get exhausted. Instead, be in each moment like flowing water. Flowing water that is not stopped by anything. Whether it comes in contact with boulders or a fallen tree, it just keeps flowing. Our body and our thinking can be truly clear when we practice in a non-stagnant flowing manner, to live this way is our Dharma offering.</p><p class="P4">“They are able to save all sentient beings who commit infractions. They can render afraid the Māras, heretics, and those attached to desire. “They are praised by all the buddhas, worthies, and sages. They reject the suffering of samsara and reveal the joy of nirvana. They are explained by all the buddhas of the ten directions and three periods of time. </p><p class="P3">The Dharma-worship is not of material worth. But see that holding onto nothing at all, that is the Dharma. The majority of those in society don’t yet know of the Dharma and are drawn to other lopsided, confused belief. But if our state of mind is clear and bright, we don’t get pulled around by externals. The teachings of the Buddhas on how important it is to purify the mind fill listeners with joy and gratitude when they hear it and share it. </p><p class="P3">So we purify our state of mind, Buddhism is not like other ‘<span class="T2">isms</span>’. From the beginning, the Buddha dharma has taught the three pure precepts; <span class="T1">“Don</span>’t do bad things. Do  good things, and purify your mind.” This is the core teaching of the Buddha, as well as the teaching that from the origin, all of our minds, are empty. Not relying on something external; all dogmas and methods and doctrines of a teaching are reduced to this truth of holding onto nothing at all.</p><p class="P3">When we open our mind widely in this way, all things are truth. Just as is it is, simple to see that we see with the eyes, that we hear with our ears, we smell with our nose, we taste with our mouth, and we feel with our body. Open our eyes to this as the way of truth without a speck of preconception of what is true. We all have the ability of our senses, but the origin of the perceptions is that mind which holds on to nothing at all. </p><p class="P3">When we were born we already were endowed with that mind that realizes the truth. This is why Master Rinzai has taught us, </p><p class="P1">“In this five foot lump of red flesh, there is a true person of no rank which is always coming in and going out. You haven’t seen this true person yet, see it now!”  </p><p class="P3">The true master, the true mind through which our senses perceive has nothing to do with appearances such as hair color or skin color or eye color. If we are not caught and cluttered, if we see the world exactly as it is, we see that nothing is permanent. Everything is always changing. We suffer because we gather up and cling to so much. But from the origin, everything is empty. Our true mind is serene and clear and unmoved in every situation. Yet gathering everything to themselves, some people do commit crimes and there is a teaching to save these people as well-there is nothing to hold onto in our minds whatsoever.</p><p class="P2">“One who hears such sutras, and devoutly understands, accepts and maintains, and reads and recites them, will with the power of skillful means explain them clearly and with discriminative understanding for sentient beings. This is because that person will be maintaining and protecting the Dharma. This is called the ‘offering of the Dharma.’</p><p class="P2">12. “Furthermore, when one practices as is explained in the Dharma, one will be in accord with the twelve [factors of] causes and conditions, transcend the heterodox views, and attain forbearance of the birthlessness of dharmas. There is definitively no self and no sentient beings, and within the retributive results of the causes and conditions there [will be in such persons] no disagreement, no contention, and the transcendence of all the qualities of self. </p><p class="P3">There are people who are attached and caught, who do not want to hear that everything is always changing. That their fame, their great fortune and all that they have gathered is not permanent. They can’t take it with them. They all become insecure and they have great fear. To bring them to this fear is also a Dharma-worship. Mistaken people will be in fear and to provide these people with this fear is also a way of Dharma worship. </p><p class="P2">“They will rely on meanings, not on words. They will rely on wisdom, not on knowledge. They will rely on sutras of comprehensive meaning and not rely on sutras of incomplete meaning. They will rely on the Dharma and not rely on a person. They will be in accord with the characteristics of the Dharma, without anywhere that is entered, without any refuge. Ignorance will be thoroughly extinguished, and hence the processes will be thoroughly extinguished. Thus birth will be thoroughly extinguished, and hence old age and death will be thoroughly extinguished. </p><p class="P3">This world is full desires, but instead of being pulled around by them, to realize that place of the dharmakaya, the clean, pure light in a moment of our mind. Of the sambogaya, the undifferentiated light in a moment of our mind. The nirmanakaya, the undiscriminating light in a moment of our mind. If we realize this, then we can let go of our dualism and become this emptiness. This truth is not born and does not die, we see how everything dies, but to not be deceived by such things dying, not to be attached to them, but to see them as they are and not be deceived. </p><p class="P3">The flowers, the colorful flowers in the mountains blossom like a great brocade. The waters in the valley streams flow quickly, a bright blue indigo. This flowering and this flowing are as they are, the eternal dharmakaya. The dharmakaya is not a thing that is in the flowers or in the streams, rather it is our total-seeing mind in this one moment. This doing totally is Dharma-worship. See the importance of this very moment, not feeling things are meaningless because the world is in flux. This is the truth of all of the Buddhas.  [Dairyo and the “Dharma-Body”. see Blue Cliff Record (82)]</p><p class="P3">The Vimalakirti sutra teaches that this truth is easily understood by all people in all eras. The twelve links of dependent origination is this basic psychology of Buddhism. We are a body with senses and with these senses we touch this world. In that touching of things, we then we find that we have attachments and we live a life shaped by that touching the world and wanting things in it, attached to what we contact. </p><p class="P3">When we lose things that we are attached to, we suffer. This is the way the twelve links of dependent origination work. We have to know who we really are, and experience the truth through that  deeply seeing eye or we are full of angst and insecurity. If we don’t look at ourself carefully and see what we really are, we may think there is a great way to live thinking that this thing is mine alone, that we can own things with money and these things that we want belong just to me, and this is why we suffer. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths, that we suffer because we gather, and when we gather we get attached to what we gather. But if we are able to let go of all of that, we stop suffering. We do this work of releasing using the eightfold path, directly understand this path and then there is no longer any being caught on birth and death because there is no birth and death. There is nothing extra and there is nothing missing. We think that we own bodies, and then we understand that we have bodies that are tools. </p><p class="P3">Our bodies we received from our parents as Master Ikkyū has said, <span class="T1">“</span>On this day, of this month, I now return this body which I was given and have been using for this whole time of my life.” These bodies that we use have to be returned. But that which uses this body has no birth and no death. </p><p class="P3">Our mind is not produced by our bodies, that true mind has no form from the origin. Our senses express the abilities of that mind that is not made by our body. Our body is used skillfully by that true mind. See that our mind is like a mirror clearly reflecting, no mirror says ‘I am a mirror’. Our mind is actually nothing at all, and yet, with our sense abilities it is able to see and hear and taste and smell. </p><p class="P3">Satori is the realizing of this directly. Satori is not some special kind of experience. Things come and go before a mirror and no mirror gets heavier or lighter because things come and go. Like the state of mind like a baby who just expresses what they are feeling in that moment. They are not necessarily going through some great experience because they laugh or cry, naturally living without fear. Our fear has come into being, it comes later and mostly from our need for approval. Prior to this we are simply a pure, empty mind. As we get older, we have to return to that direct mind which we see in a baby.</p><p class="P3">Originally we were in Clear mind. If we plant a good seed, then good things come forth from the seed planted. If we give a seed everything it needs it can grow in its best possible way. This is called cause and effect. </p><p class="P3">Our way of being, our point of view is part of our cause and  how we are with people is the effect of that. Fortunate or not fortunate is about how we relate to other people. To do this without ego is Dharma-worship. As the Beatitudes say, <span class="T1">“</span>Blessed is the one with the mind of the child for they shall enter Heaven.”  This is our original mind, and with that mind receiving only what we need and using what we learn for all people that is Dharma-worship.</p><p class="P3">We must look at words and how things are said, things that are appropriate at one moment may not be appropriate at a different time. To not hold onto any thought at all is what is most important. This is the true wisdom. If we are without preconceived notions, then we don’t see mistakenly. The world is a feast and our wisdom is the vessel for that feast. How we receive this world has everything to do with how our wisdom is and our way of being a vessel receiving what we perceive. </p><p class="P2">13. The Buddha told the heavenly emperor, “When Prince Moon Canopy heard this Dharma from Medicine King Buddha, he attained the forbearance of compliance. Taking off his jeweled robe and bodily ornaments, he offered them to the Buddha, saying ‘World-honored One, after your nirvana I will practice the offering of the Dharma and defend the correct Dharma. Please use your numinous charisma compassionately, so that I will be able to subjugate the vengeful Māras and cultivate the practices of the bodhisattva.’” </p><p class="P2">Knowing the profound thoughts in [the prince’s] mind, [Medicine King] Buddha made the prediction, “At the very end, you will defend the Dharma city.” </p><p class="P3">Furthermore, the Buddha says these words to Taishakuten, that we should see that there is suffering, but that how are we to become liberated from it?  Thinking the world is full of terrible people, that this is a terrible world is not the way forward. Instead to awaken our deep state of mind and see actually how everyone is a Buddha. Everyone has always been endowed with that nature and that is the Mahayana. </p><p class="P3">Everyone is capable, everyone has the potential of understanding all of this. It may come to light for different people at different times in their lives, it is not that one can cure another. It is just that the understanding has not yet occurred in the other. People are different but the Dharma is not. What is understood is the same. But, we are different in how we come to understand it. </p><p class="P3">As the Heart Sutra teaches, we are all born with the mind that is without birth without death, nothing missing, nothing extra, none of this existence has ever been something we were attached to. But we get a deluded view from our ego and we think that we are attached, or we think that we have to be good. If our mind is clear, we don’t judge and see in this deluded way. We can be our original Clear mind and then we are unattached. </p><p class="P2">14. [The Buddha told the] heavenly emperor, “Prince Moon Canopy then saw the purity of the Dharma. Hearing the Buddha bestow a prediction [of future buddhahood] on him, he developed faith and left home. After cultivating the good Dharma with exertion for not very long, he attained the five numinous penetrations and became a bodhisattva. He attained dhāraṇī and unending eloquence. After the nirvana of that buddha, using the power of the numinous penetrations, dhāraṇī, and eloquence that he had attained, he disseminated the wheel of the Dharma that Medicine King Buddha had turned for a full ten short kalpas. Through his diligent practice and exertion in defending the Dharma, in that lifetime Moon Canopy bhikṣu converted a million koṭis of people, who became irreversible in their [quest for] anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Fourteen nayutas of people generated the profound inspiration to become śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Immeasurable sentient beings gained birth in the heavens. </p><p class="P3">When we get old we have to look at our state of mind just as it is, seeing that there is no devil making us behave badly. Rather there is a mind’s light that is shining through even in what appears to be darkness. Not being upset when we go into the kitchen and we forget why did we go in there. What were we going in there for anyway?  Hold onto our strong motivation and don’t keep saying how very old we are. Work with these things creatively and use with our natural wisdom, then it is the same as not getting caught on our narrow-minded anger and hostilities. At every possible opportunity decrease the anger and live in a way that is positive. This too is our Dharma-worship. </p><p class="P2">“Heavenly emperor, was not the Prince Jeweled Canopy of that time an unusual person! As of now he has attained buddhahood and is entitled Jewel Mirage Tathāgata. Those thousand princes became the thousand buddhas of the bhadrakalpa. The first achieved buddhahood as Krakucchandra, and the last will be the Tathāgata named Ruci. Moon Canopy bhikṣu was I myself. </p><p class="P2">15. “Thus, heavenly emperor, you should understand this essential point: the offering of the Dharma excels all other offerings. It is supreme, incomparable. Therefore, heavenly emperor, you should use the offering of the Dharma to make offerings to the buddhas.” </p><p class="P3">In people, in human beings, flexibility is of the greatest value. If there are various opinions, to see the many sides and look at what is the best solution, not bringing in emotions and an ego view, and conflict, rather be with harmony and share a huge state of mind. We cannot be impatient in our zazen if we are cultivating this huge state of mind. These bodhisattvas awakened to this state of mind and not being moved around, upset or in conflict could bring forth the Dharma offering.</p><p class="P3"> We look at the bodhisattvas, Kannon sama, Manjusri, Fugen, all are the manifest patience of Mahayana wisdom. In a person of the world, with earings and necklaces, all of these decorations he then offered. Sesson Buddha then the most advanced Buddha of all of them said that he would promise that he would guard and protect the way of the bodhisattvas. His deepest vow is they may all realize complete liberation. </p><p class="P3">In the same way the Buddha says to Makakasho Sonja. <span class="T1">“</span>I have the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvana. The true form of the formless and the subtle Dharma gate independent of words, transmitted beyond doctrine, thus I have entrusted this.”  </p><p class="Standard">That truth, that actual original nature, awake to it completely. Do not to dwell in dark states of mind, but think of those in society with no separation between you and them. To be grateful for this day’s life is the greatest blessing. See clearly and directly, not thinking or wishing we had this or that. Taishakuten says that the most important Dharma-worship is to support people in the Dharma.</p></body></html>
