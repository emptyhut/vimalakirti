At this point Śāriputra saw that there were no seats in the room. He thought, “Where will this congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?” The Elder Vimalakīrti knew what he was thinking and said to Śāriputra, “Which is it, sir—did you come for the Dharma or come seeking a seat?”</p><p class="P3">From today we will read together the sixth chapter of the Vimalakirti Sutra, “The Inconceivable.” Vimalakirti, it was written, has been visited by many—32,000 bodhisattvas and 8000 great disciples all were in the room where Vimalakirti rested. This room was approximately two meters by two meters in size, yet into this tiny room where everything had been removed except one bed where Vimalakirti was resting, all of those people entered. The great tea master Rikyu, who held Vimalakirti especially important, purposely used this same size - room for the smallest gathering of people to drink tea together. Today in Japan this same size room is still used for the serving of tea.  Large tea gatherings can be for hundreds, but a small tea ceremony is always for only three or four people, each invited specifically because their mind would meet well with the others and they could communicate. This is the way of the small tea room tea ceremony. Nothing luxurious is used, always making use of what is already there, and being creative with everything.  That which is used and served is the entertainment and the subject of conversation during the tea ceremony, and while drinking tea to also learn the wisdom of the Buddha.</p><p class="P3">Two meters by two meters, this small room where Vimalakirti was is also called a ‘hojo,’ the basic unit of size for a room for simple, harmonious communication. But how would all those disciples and bodhisattvas possibly fit into that room of two meters by two meters? Good and bad, many and few, success or failure–using these dualistic ways of looking at things, these kinds of ideas and discriminative ways of thinking, they could not possibly fit into a room two meters by two meters. But if that room of two meters by two meters is known as the whole universe, then all of them can fit easily.</p><p class="P3">And so we might ask, why not just say from the start that this single room was like the whole universe? This is where Zen does not allow dualistic thought. This room is the manifestation of each person’s mind, and if it is a mind which is clear and unobstructed, then it is the size of the universe. If it is a mind full of dualism and discrimination, then this room is very small. Two to three millimeters is the size of our retina, and yet into our eyes what huge things enter! We can perceive enormous things with those very tiny retinas. How is this possible? To live in a huge state of mind, more huge than one can usually fathom! This room of Vimalakirti was not mystifying for him. Four thousand people, even 100,000 people or any number of people could go in if they just went in one at a time. To be creative in this way is our wisdom. This is the teaching of the chapter on The Inconceivable.</p><p class="P3">Sariputra Sonja, who was one of the Buddha’s great disciples, had the greatest wisdom. He was called Sharishiva and he is read about in the Heart Sutra where he appears twice–his name meaning he is the son of a woman who is like a white bird (shari). His mother had been very, very wise, and her brother was also wise; he was a scholar who was named Choumo Shi Sonja. “A scholar who has very long fingernails” was the name of her brother because, when he learned about the nephew to be born to his sister and the great wisdom this nephew was bound to have, being born as the son of such a great wise mother, he was so excited that he even forgot to cut his fingernails. Sariputra was this nephew and a great disciple of the Buddha.</p><p class="P3">The Vimalakirti Sutra is a great advertisement for the Mahayana, along with some other sutras which are particularly for that, and Sariputra Sonja plays the role of the bad guy in this sutra occasionally. For example, here he notices there are no chairs for all the bodhisattvas and others to sit down on when they come to visit Vimalakirti, and he mentions that they need chairs for all the visitors who come into the room. To which Vimalakirti says, “Sariputra, did you come with Manjusri to visit me or to find a chair? Didn’t you come because Manjusri and I are going to be discussing the Dharma, and now you want a chair, too?” </p><p class="P3">No! No! replies Sariputra. I have came for your great wisdom. I’m not waiting here for a chair.</p><p class="P1">2. Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, those who seek the Dharma should begrudge neither body nor life. How much more so a seat!</p><p class="P1">“To seek the Dharma is not a seeking in the context of form, sensation, concept, processes, and consciousness, nor a seeking in the context of the realms (dhātus) and entrances (āyatanas).</p><p class="P1">“[To seek the Dharma] is not a seeking in the context of [the three realms of] desire, form, and formlessness.</p><p class="P1">3. “O Śāriputra, in seeking the Dharma one should not be attached to the Buddha in seeking, nor be attached to the Dharma in seeking, nor be attached to the congregation [of the Sangha] in seeking. In seeking the Dharma, one should seek without recognizing suffering, one should seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering], one should seek without contriving the complete realization and cultivation of the path. Why? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If one says ‘I will recognize suffering, cut off the accumulation [of suffering], and realize the extinction [of suffering] and cultivate the path,’ this would be a contrived theory and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti says then what Dharma is. It actually is wisdom, and this wisdom is innate. Not to be confused with learned knowledge, but to be wise and creative from that inborn wisdom! Today we have infinite information and knowledge–from the internet, for example–but we have to use it creatively and wisely, to make use of this wisdom with which we are all endowed. The Dharma is not something to be sought for externally. That source of all knowledge is wisdom and Dharma. All Dharma is the universe; it is the universe which uses that knowledge. If there is no Dharma we cannot make use of our knowledge, so especially for liberating others it is very important.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti says, “Sariputra! This is Dharma! This is our body! Or else it is nothing but a lump of flesh. You come and are saying that you want to have a chair. Well, this body is not to be what uses the Dharma; the body is used by the Dharma. Just to come and rest our body is not the point of it.” In this way he further reprimands Sariputra.</p><p class="P3">To clarify the Dharma we have to look at our perceptions–our hearing of the bird, our seeing of the flower. “What kind of bird is that?” “It’s a red flower!” This questioning brings forth motivation to act, and we want to put the flower in our room. We put the flower in our room and  use our senses further in the doing of that. Because we have a body we also have many desires. We want to see something, we want to hear something, we like one thing, we dislike another. Our ego has preferences. We feel insecure, we get confused in our mind; sometimes we also feel good and aligned. But all of these come forth from our five sense aggregates. Even if we feel it as something externally caused  or something happening to us, there is actually nothing causing it. It’s only a function of a phenomenon coming from the activity of these aggregates. And in seeing this clearly and actually realizing this is what’s happening, we can see the emptiness of our own suffering that has only ever come forth from these transient aggregates; what influences us strongly here is our habits and our preferences. Our zazen and our wisdom enables us to clarify this. To see directly and clearly that our body is empty, our motivation is empty, our ego is empty, and our feelings are empty! Our body is a collection of billions of transient cells. We are not always seeing that red flower, and we only move to pick it because there was a motivation which arose from the seeing of it. Our ego was never there in the first place when we were born, but formed later around the age of three when we began to perceive dualistically. None of these have any fixed, substantial, actuality and so they are only phenomena and not Dharma, and there is nothing there to be pulled around by. Our perceptions and the movement that comes forth from them are always changing, and because we are engaged in these things that are always changing, that cannot be said to be Dharma. Dharma is that which does not change.</p><p class="P3">Making it even more complex, we have these six perceptions: our eyes see, our ears hear things, our nose smells things, our mouth tastes things, there is feeling on our skin of hot and cold, we hold things, and we also have a wide, huge awareness, even of this whole earth, using various combinations of our senses. But even if we see a flower, if we had had no previous experience we wouldn’t know that that which we are seeing is a flower or that that flower that we are seeing is red. Also, our eyes and ears are not dependable, but always changing. So these as well are not part of what the Dharma is because they are always changing.</p><p class="P3">We see and hear and smell, but it is the source of all of that that is the Dharma. It is not about what is doing or what is being perceived, but that which gives life to the perception and that which is manifested by it. The river is not the Dharma, the mountain is not the Dharma, the flower is not the Dharma, the other manifestations are not the Dharma, but that which is doing the manifesting is the Dharma. If we were to put it in a different way, it is not about mentally understanding, it is about what is prior to that mental understanding. Forgetting our small self completely, to return to the place prior to where there is any notion of a small self, where there is no self to be understood–to perceive it from that place, it is then called the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">People in the olden days always wanted to put it so intimately. In the way that Kobo Daishi said it as well, the Dharma is that which is doing the seeing, the hearing, the smelling. But meanwhile there is no noticing of that seeing, hearing and smelling being done, like a fire that can’t burn itself, like an eye which can’t see itself. They function but they cannot self-reflect. In this way, to function with no self-reflection, this is the Dharma. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti further says this is a world of many strata. These three strata are the realm of desire, the realm of form, and the realm of formlessness. For some people it seems like a world based on desires for this and for that–things to see, things to hear. Others will see it as  a material world, a world based only on that which is material; they are unable to believe in things that are invisible or that cannot to be perceived by the senses. The world of the formless is the world of the artist, the musician, the writer–the world of mind, of creativity and perception. We all see these strata, these three realms, in different ways, and we all see our lives in terms of these three different strata. If we are stuck on one particular stratum, if we depend on something–something which is material, something which is of one of those strata–then that is not the Dharma. The Dharma is that which is doing the seeking of the desire, the seeking of the form, the seeking of the formless. We live in a way that is a combination of these various strata, but if we depend on any of them, that is not the Dharma. Only if we can forget ourselves completely, then we can open up to becoming that Dharma completely.</p><p class="P1">“To seek the Dharma is not a seeking in the context of form, sensation, concept, processes, and consciousness, nor a seeking in the context of the realms (dhātus) and entrances (āyatanas).</p><p class="P1">“[To seek the Dharma] is not a seeking in the context of [the three realms of] desire, form, and formlessness.</p><p class="P3">Again Vimalakirti teaches: A Buddha statue is not the Dharma. Neither are the words written in the sutras the Dharma. No matter what excellent features on a Buddha statue, that is only meant as a representation of the splendid character of the Buddha, not some statue to be worshipping. Many people will say that all these people training here (at Tahoma Monastery), they’ve been training for so long and they’re still all so messed up. But of course! That is why we continue training, because we’re all so incomplete; we’re not totally empty-minded all the time. When we express the state of mind of Dharma it is most splendid.</p><p class="P2">Obaku and Shukusho Kotei</p><p class="P3">Rinzai Zenji’s teacher, Master Obaku, was always doing prostrations. One time when Master Obaku was doing prostrations in the place where he had been learning from Enkan Kokushi he was visited by the emperor-to-be, Shukusho Kotei, and the emperor-to-be said to him, knowing that he was very fond of the words of Vimalakirti, “Vimalakirti says that we should not be relying on anything, not even on a Buddha, a Dharma, or a Sangha. So why do you do prostrations all the time if it’s not prostrating to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha?” Immediately Obaku slapped him. And Shukusho Kotei got very angry and said to him, “You are way too rough! Only to become empty-minded completely, this is the best way to realize this place.” And Obaku then answered him, “Where in that empty-mindedness is there any such thing as rough or not rough?”</p><p class="P3">When great athletes are playing their sports in the best possible way, they are not thinking about their feet and their body and their hands. There’s a poem about playing an oriental stringed instrument called the shamisen that goes,</p><p class="P3">The shamisen—Play it with your heart. Do not play it with your hands. Don’t play it with your hands, But become that quiet mind.</p><p class="P3">Great athletes, great artists–none of them are concerned with what part of their body is doing their art and sport. Rather, to live in accordance with the Dharma and become totally empty-minded; in this way it all becomes expressed of itself.</p><p class="P3">Our zazen as well is not about thinking about how good or bad our zazen is. By the third day here we have forgotten the external world and can just melt completely empty-mindedly into the sitting, the drinking, the meals, the walking. We have an idea that we are sitting well or that we are not, and immediately the ego slips in. To joyfully dive in and become one with each activity, with each moment: that is the Dharma. Not to be criticizing ourselves and separating from it, but to realize that we are being given life, we are being lived through by this Dharma. To not be training and always be criticizing ourselves, but to find that by continuing this ongoing training, even the inclination to do that melts away. In this way our training enables us to see how the Dharma is truth.</p><p class="P3">When Vimalakirti teaches, we hear his deepest wisdom being expressed, and without even knowing it we learn from listening. This is his superior skillfulness.</p><p class="P1">3. “O Śāriputra, in seeking the Dharma one should not be attached to the Buddha in seeking, nor be attached to the Dharma in seeking, nor be attached to the congregation [of the Sangha] in seeking. In seeking the Dharma, one should seek without recognizing suffering, one should seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering], one should seek without contriving the complete realization and cultivation of the path. Why? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If one says ‘I will recognize suffering, cut off the accumulation [of suffering], and realize the extinction [of suffering] and cultivate the path,’ this would be a contrived theory and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">This is taken from the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path which were constantly being taught by the Buddha, teaching that suffering comes from grasping and then feeling sad when we lose the things we grasp for, and that the cessation of suffering occurs by practicing the eightfold path.  But the verbalization of even these essential teachings is not the true Dharma. If we even think we have practiced or are practicing or have practiced a lot, that is no longer the Dharma. Yet neither does that mean that we should not seek and not practice. Rather, we should seek and practice but do it so thoroughly and so completely that we don’t even notice we’re doing it anymore. </p><p class="P3">As Master Dogen has said, we all have the potential within, but without awakening that potential, we can’t manifest it. The Buddha’s most direct Path of Cessation of Suffering—if we are attached even to that Path, that is not the Dharma. The reason the verbalized Eightfold Path is not the point is because it often ends with words only–emptily spoken words while we are in actuality still attached. To say, ‘I understand the Path and have stopped grasping’–that is formulation and verbalization. Rather, to actually do it to where we don’t even notice we are doing it. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti puts it this way, though frequently people couldn’t really get it when told to practice even beyond knowing they’re practicing, to seek to where there is nothing more to seek, without even knowing one is seeking. But this is the truth of the Path.</p><p class="P3">Neither are the Precepts words, but they are a way of living from within. As the Buddha taught, Take refuge in nothing which is external. Take refuge only in the Dharma. Do not take refuge in other people; take refuge only within. As the Buddha said at the end of his life, he had never spoken a single word of Dharma. As it is also said, All things are transient, nothing is eternal. This is the way things actually work. We get very caught on some ideas or something we think is absolute, but there is nothing that is fixed; everything is transient. If we get caught on anything, we are immediately mistaken. But if we are free from any grasping, our mind is naturally and spontaneously calm and peaceful. Originally there is not one single thing. With this state of mind we live every day and then everything becomes realizing the Dharma. We see that things manifest and disappear, and we don’t get caught on any of that. We perceive ourselves as deluded, but to not hold on to even that. That is not seeking. The transiency of all of it has to be recognized. But if we hold even that as something absolute, that goes against it.</p><p class="P3">So these are the road signs to the Path up the mountain, but it has to be walked, actually walked, continuously, not just referred to verbally. And when we finally reach the top of that mountain we forget those road signs, those hard switchbacks, the valleys below. It is not about walking this mountain forever. It <span class="semiBoldItalic">is</span> about getting to the mountain’s top, realizing that liberation. But while seeking we cannot get caught on its verbalization and stopped there.</p><p class="P1">“O Śāriputra, the Dharma is named extinction, it is calm and peaceful: if one practices generation and extinction this is to seek generation and extinction, not to seek the Dharma.”</p><p class="P3">Sariputra had come to Vimalakirti’s room where there were many thousands of beings and asked for a chair. “Reverend Sariputra, did you come here for the sake of the Dharma or did you come here for the sake of a chair?” The Dharma is about forgetting your body completely. There is the story of the disciple of the Buddha–one of his relatives–named Ananda. He had a severe carbuncle on his back. There was a doctor named Giba who was always close by the Buddha and taking care of him, who said that he would operate on the carbuncle on Ananda’s back. To cut it would hurt very much, and there were no such things as anesthetics in those days. But Ananda said that he would listen to the Buddha’s teaching during the operation and then he would feel no pain because he would forget his body completely as he listened to the Buddha’s teaching. And that is what he did, losing track of his body completely while being operated on.</p><p class="P3">At first we notice our body so much in zazen. But eventually we even forget we have a body. We lose track of every kind of thought. We become only clear and we become a state of mind which is equanimous. This is how it works when we are not holding on to any idea about it.</p><p class="P3">Nangaku Ejo Zenji trained with the Sixth Patriarch. When he first came to visit the Sixth Patriarch, the Sixth Patriarch asked him where he was from. This question cannot be answered casually; it’s not going to be satisfied with a name, a place, or simply calling oneself a monk. To truly answer this question it took Nangaku Ejo eight years–eight years until he could say that only what can’t be spoken of had arrived there. Nangaku Ejo Zenji was already an excellent, high-level scholar, and yet it took him eight years to realize this state of mind and to actualize it. Asked who he was, and the Sixth Patriarch not accepting anything he would come in with: not a man, not a woman, not rich, not poor, not enlightened, not ignorant–he dug into it deeply. But no matter what words or ideas he brought in, they were not accepted. He sat and sat and realized an immovable state of mind. The Sixth Patriarch was not just listening to his words when he came in, he was seeing that state of mind.</p><p class="P3">This answer of Nangaku Ejo’s is the same for all of the Buddhas, it is the same for Shakyamuni, the same for all of the awakened ones. No one was talking about how they had realized some great state of mind. ”Now, don’t soil it!” This is true of everyone, whether they realize it or not. In earlier history, Zen teaching would often be expressed by drawing a circle. These circles were drawn to express that state of mind which is beyond dualism, where there is no such thing as dividing it into good and evil. No need to use words. And one who had realized this experience would easily understand why it was a circle that was drawn.</p><p class="P1">“The Dharma is named the undefiled: if the dharmas, up to and including nirvana, are defiled, then this is defiled attachment and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">The Dharma is to let go of everything, even letting go of our own idea that we are practicing. To not even be thinking that we are doing something called “practice,” like an athlete who isn’t thinking that she’s making a great play or a musician who isn’t thinking that he’s making great music. In our daily life when we are doing our very best, our deepest and most effective work, we have forgotten our body and our thoughts completely.</p><p class="P1">“The Dharma is without any locus of its practice: if one practices in the Dharma, this is a locus of practice and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">“The Dharma is without grasping and forsaking: if one grasps and forsakes the Dharma, then this is grasping and forsaking and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">In the world, people are not always holding onto what they are doing or thinking about whether they look good or not. For example, we have someone as great as Mother Theresa, helping the poor, helping people who have Hanson’s Disease (formerly called leprosy) and other great challenging problems. And yet she certainly was not thinking all the time about what a good job she was doing. We have to throw away everything we are doing. Only in doing that is it truly the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">4. “The Dharma is without locus, it is not a secure refuge: if one is attached to locus, this is to be attached to locus and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">The Dharma is not only about something which happens in a zendo but is in every single part of our life, in our everyday life. We are making it into something special when it is about not being moved around by anything.</p><p class="P1">“The Dharma is named ‘without characteristics’: if one’s understanding accords with characteristics, this is to seek characteristics and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">As Hakuin Zenji has said in the Song of Zazen, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be any place else. Realizing the thought of no-thought as thought, whether singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.” To be in this truth in each moment, no matter where we are. No matter what we are doing, we do it because it is necessary: waking, sleeping, coming, going, but never moving a single step. Things come right to us, we don’t move toward or away from them at all. It’s not about thinking, “I did this,” “I finished that.” Just as Hakuin is telling us here, it is not such a dualistic view.</p><p class="P1">“One cannot abide in the Dharma: if one abides in the Dharma, this is to abide in the Dharma and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">In the Diamond Sutra it is written, “Abiding nowhere, Awakened Mind arises–that which is not moved around by anything, just wherever we are, doing the tasting, the seeing–just wherever we are doing whatever we are doing without being stagnant in anything we do or anything we say. </p><p class="P3">We know this place which is talked of in days of old as a place where the river flows, and even if there are great rocks and huge tree trunks it continues just flowing right by them, going forward, not stopped, not with an idea that something has to be like this or has to be like that. That is only playing around with dualism and is not the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">“One cannot see, hear, sense, or know the Dharma: if one practices seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, this is seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing and not to seek the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">We are living along with the Dharma, but while we live with it we don’t know it because there is no discrimination. And when there is no discrimination, that is the Dharma. The Dharma is for all people to live in any and every situation but it is different in accordance with whether we have realized that or not. At each place at each time we can get easily confused, but it isn’t about whether we were praised or insulted. We are not moved around by any of that. Each moment’s life energy is our Dharma. Even dualism is Dharma, too. We are not caught on that either, or resistant, saying, “No, no, it must be like this!” In each moment, just being in accordance with each and every situation completely, not dealing with such differentiations as color and form or being young or old, man or woman, rich or poor; realizing each situation and moment clearly but not being caught by anything in it. Because we get caught, the world gets complex. We get stuck. We think of suicide. But this is because we don’t understand. There are always going to be ways out. To experience this we have the Sixth Patriarch’s definition of zazen: “To let go of every idea of good and bad that we are always attaching to all of our perceptions of things external, and at the same time, to drop all of our concerns within.” To not be caught on what we see, hear and feel all over the place; we have to let all of it go–once–to the place where we can see how huge we really are. This is the word “maha” of the Maha Prajna Paramita Sutra– the Heart Sutra–that hugeness as huge as the great sky, endless and boundless. We are that huge. We are completely free. We are able to be like a flower or a bird. And while this is the Dharma, if we think that about it, it becomes dualistic.</p><p class="P3">The thoughts which we have to have because we need to do things–they’re not so many; they’re relatively few compared to the huge number of thoughts that come up as soon as we sit. We’re astonished by how many thoughts are suddenly buzzing around in our head as if we had struck a bee’s nest; there are that many thoughts coming into our head. It’s also kind of like methane gas, a methane gas puddle in our brain with all of these fermenting thoughts. And we’re kind of addicted to this methane gas in our brain. We get addicted to this methane gas and we want to stay caught on our thoughts. We have to send fresh air into this by holding on to nothing at all–not just thinking that we should be holding onto nothing at all, but actually holding onto nothing at all, and this is not so easy. The thoughts keep pouring in and pouring in and pouring in.</p><p class="P3">If it is something of form that we are trying to move out of our way, an object or material thing, we can just push it over there, move it away. But in our mind it is so hard to push away a persistent thought which keeps coming back. For this we have to use wisdom. Wisdom is something like a mother in a store with her child who has decided that he is definitely going to have his mother buy a certain thing, even if he has to scream and shout until she finally gives up and does it. But for this screaming child, a wise mother will simply, quickly, turn his attention to something completely different. And suddenly the child will have totally forgotten that he was upset, and what he was upset about. Suddenly the crying stops while the new external interest is discovered. The Dharma is not about being caught. But we have to be able to liberate ourselves or we cannot liberate others.</p><p class="P3">We put things in our mouth and saliva comes forth; we swallow and our stomach conveniently divides things into fluid and solids, and sends what the liver, lungs and heart need, to them. These are all done without our even helping. Our organs all work on their own without even being given orders from the brain. Even if we don’t chew well and eat too many oily things, our body still moves things through.  In the same way, if we think too much then we go against the natural way. But even this is still the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">5. The Dharma is named the unconditioned: if one practices [within] the conditioned, this is to seek the conditioned and not to seek the Dharma. “Therefore, Śāriputra, if one seeks the Dharma one should be without seeking regarding all the dharmas.”</p><p class="P3">So, Sariputra, if you are interested in anything, you block Dharma’s natural way of being. But to be empty-minded is not so easy. It’s very difficult. When we are three we get interested in having our own personal position and we defend ourselves by attacking others. If we are always living in dualism it is so hard for us to return to empty-mindedness. But we have these inescapable gates which will remind us and teach us how. Those are the gates of birth, sickness, old age, and death. We always think this death is something so far off, but we never, never know. To always be ready! There is not a way that we can do this. We’re always trying to choose the best thing, but that will not do this, either. People are always trying to take what <span class="semiBoldItalic">they</span> want most, what is of the most benefit, but this won’t do it. We come into this world naturally, with only one thing, and that is our Unborn Mind. As it says in the Heart Sutra, our true clear Mind is like a mirror; it simply reflects everything that comes to it. Those things that are reflected in a mirror have no substance, and even if it reflects dirty things, a mirror does not get dirty. But whatever comes to it is simply reflected from this Unborn Mind–the mirror-like Mind. And everything that comes is accepted, and everything is then let go of. As Daruma Daishi has said, to let go of every single external connection we have, completely, and then to give up every concern within. He taught our refuge clearly. To not push things that we’re trying to have happen, with insistence: we’re always trying to fight and push to get what we want, and this is where the problem arises. We have to take refuge in the Dharma and its cultivation.</p><p class="P3">In China there is a teaching of having no intention, no rank and no meaning. In China it is also said that for ruling people wisely it has to be done evenly. And for this, the idea of merit is important. They teach, for example, that we receive rain and sun and natural blessings as merit that we all have equally, seeing as we are all given these together. Also, for the global problems today this is important. What will come, will come. To become huge, to see this clearly, and to see how today people are in such a big hurry when what we need to do is to wait and be patient for things because the natural course will come forth. We instead try to make it all happen so fast and try to make things get going so fast, and so we crush what might happen. Everything is already right just as it needs to be. To trust in that and to see things from our most huge state of mind.</p><p class="P1">When he spoke these words, five hundred gods attained purity of the Dharma eye with regard to the dharmas.</p><p class="P3">This chapter “Inconceivable Liberation” is truly telling us of the inconceivable. We generally live in a dualistic mental world and cannot stretch easily to a world of the inconceivable. That actuality of the inconceivable becomes hard to believe. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti leaves that common sense world behind to teach us the truth. We are born and live for a lifetime, and get through life and its pains and sufferings shut down in a framework of life and death. We learn to think from early on that we are this person and we judge things accordingly, seeing only through our limited awareness and experience. We live in our sullied world wanting to break through it and be liberated from that narrowness. For this, God and Buddha and Infinity and a Life Forever have been invented, imagining a heaven, a paradise which opposes a dirty world, making these imagined things, making an absolute that we believe–this is how it is. This is our great foolishness, making us even more melancholy today.</p><p class="P3">Today we have this idea of liberating; we see this idea but we can’t easily pick up what we have once discarded in a world that has thrown away god. So what moves this world? What is its engine? For our ancestors who believed in a god it was their conscious ideal. But caught on the small-minded concept of who we are, and because we could not mentally grasp something so huge, we could not make the leap. This is why Vimalakirti is working with us like this.</p><p class="P3">Sariputra carelessly said what had popped into his mind, that all these bodhisattvas were there to hear the Dharma and wouldn’t they get tired without even a single chair. Vimalakirti answered, had he come there for the Dharma or for a chair? For the Dharma we have to give up everything–our body, all of it. As Daruma Daishi said to Niso Eka Daishi who had come to ask him to teach him the Dharma, “With a small-minded, ambitious, conceited mind like yours, one cannot perceive the Dharma.” People today are all stuck on an idea of their small, limited, self-centered identity, and we don’t want to give that up. This is what Daruma Daishi was saying to Niso Eka Daishi. And because in those words, like these of Vimalakirti, things seem like bragging, people have a hard time believing them. And because we are so entrenched in our mentally attached framework, we can’t even begin to imagine our true source, which is what is being shown here.</p><p class="P1">6. At this time the Elder Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī, “Sir, in your wanderings throughout the immeasurable ten million koṭis of incalculable numbers of [buddha] countries, which buddha land has lion seats made with the best and most wondrous qualities?” </p><p class="P3">Since Sariputra had spoken earlier about the chairs, Vimalakirti brings this up, addressing Manjusri–the same Manjusri who is honored in the middle of the zendo, being, as he is, the manifestation of wisdom who can see everything in everyone as perfectly equal. Piercing through the past, the present and the future, Manjusri can move freely through these worlds which are immeasurably distant. In the cosmology of India there is one sun, one moon; around the sun the planets move, including our Milky Way, and there are one thousand of those. One thousand of those is one small realm. There is one buddha in each small realm, teaching the truth. And one thousand small realms make a medium realm, and one thousand of these medium realms make a great big realm. If we gather three thousand great big realms, that is the size of our universe–beyond imagination. And it is countless, immeasurable years–this we cannot even figure out with the computer. Vimalakirti says to Manjusri, “Didn’t you see a fine chair over there in that far-off world some place?”</p><p class="P3">Mañjuśrī said, “Retired scholar, in the east, as many countries away as there are grains of sand in thirty-six Ganges Rivers, there is a world-system called Characteristic of Sumeru. Its buddha is called Sumeru Lamp King, who is manifest [in that world] at present. That buddha’s body is eighty-four thousand yojanas tall. His lion seat is eighty-four thousand yojanas high and paramount in ornamentation.”</p><p class="P1">7. At this the Elder Vimalakīrti manifested the power of numinous penetration, and immediately that Buddha dispatched thirty-two thousand lion seats, tall, wide, and pure in ornamentation, which arrived in Vimalakīrti’s room. This was something the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indras, Brahmās, and four heavenly kings had never seen before.</p><p class="P1">The breadth of the room entirely accommodated the thirty-two thousand lion seats with no obstruction. Nor was there any deformation of the city of Vaiśālī, Jambudvīpa, or all the worlds of four continents. All appeared just as before.</p><p class="P3">At that moment Vimalakirti, having focused himself in concentration, performed a miraculous feat such that the Lord Tathagata Merupradipadaya in the universe Merudaya sent to this universe 32,000 thrones. These thrones were so tall, spacious and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, shakras, brahmas, lokapalas and other gods had never seen the like.</p><p class="P3">The Ganges River, which runs from the Himalayas and empties into the Bengal Bay, is a huge river. One cannot even see across to the other shore. And there are as many lands as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. The land that is far away is Merudaya and its buddha is named Merupradapadaya. He has a throne that is inconceivably huge. Vimalakirti then used his supernatural powers–kind of like using a cell phone today–and then had delivered by freight–kind of like Japanese takubin today—all of these chairs delivered to the two-by-two meter room of Vimalakirti, and they fit there with no problem at all. With any common sense this would not be possible. Even with these many huge chairs in this small room there was no twisting or problem, and everything fit perfectly. When we hear this it sounds like a lot of bragging, but even in our own tiny physical eye fits a Mt. Rainier and the sky so full of far away stars. So we can’t call that bragging. We have to look at what our own amazing body and world can do.</p><p class="P3">(The roshi) recently received a photograph of the Andromeda Galaxy, and it was taken at home. Imagine that! We can photograph something as huge and far away as that, and yet we still stay hemmed in by thoughts about how terrible that person is and how could this person do that and how bad the economic situation is and shall we hang ourself or rob a bank. Here we have a huge mind that can create so many positive alternatives. It is this that the Vimalakirti sutra is pointing out.</p><p class="P3">These thrones were so spacious and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, shakras, brahmas, lokapalas and other gods had never seen the like. The thrones descended from the sky and came to rest in the house of the Licchavi Vimalakirti. The 32,000 thrones arranged themselves without crowding and the house seemed to enlarge itself accordingly. The great city of Vaisali did not become obscured, nor did the land of Jampudvipa nor the world of four continents. Everything appeared just as it was before.</p><p class="P1">8. At this time Vimalakīrti said to Mañjuśrī, “Take a lion seat and sit there along with the bodhisattvas and superior ones. You should adjust [the size of] your body to match the image of the seat.”</p><p class="P1">Those bodhisattvas who had attained the numinous penetrations immediately transformed themselves to become forty-two thousand yojanas [tall] and sat on the lion seats. But none of the beginner bodhisattvas or great disciples were able to ascend [to the seats].</p><p class="P3">Then Vimalakirti invited them all to get up on the thrones, which the bodhisattvas did with their supernatural powers. So why could they get up on those huge thrones? Because they do zazen and they know how to go beyond the zendo, swallowing it all down. To say our body is hurting and we are in bad shape here and there, it really doesn’t make any sense. </p><p class="P3">We do each breath as if we are filling a balloon– each breath, every breath–with every one of our 360 smallest joints, our 84,000 smallest hair pores, with all of them, with our whole body and being, to throw ourselves into this, one breath after the next. It is as if a balloon is being inflated. Our hair pores are standing on end. We would explode with a single touch of a pin. That mind that was caught on an ego is pierced through. We have to awaken to this state of mind, which we have been endowed with from the origin. There is nothing to be afraid of. No matter what suffering comes, to extend our hand to help. Our universe-sized awakening is already right within each of us.</p><p class="P3">But the unripe bodhisattvas, they were like the drivers in Japan who have the cars with the green leaf marks saying, “Please, if you’re afraid of how I drive, let me go slowly and you go ahead.” These young bodhisattvas, they didn’t quite have it together yet, and they were having a hard time getting up on those thrones. All of the experienced bodhisattvas could get right up on the huge thrones, but the disciples were having a hard time. </p><p class="P1">At that time Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “Take a lion seat.”</p><p class="P1">Śāriputra said, “Retired scholar, this seat is [so] huge I am unable to ascend it.”</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti asks Sariputra, who was the one who had asked for a chair in the first place, now that he had one why didn’t he sit down on it. “I can’t. It’s too big for me; I can’t get up on it.” We are always thinking in terms of our own size. But in fact, as Master Hakuin has said, “We are like one who in the midst of water cries out desperately in thirst. We are like the son of a rich man who wandered away among the poor.” In fact, we are water, but being caught on ourselves we always think that we are ice. We can’t fit as a plate-shaped piece of ice into a cup until we become water. If we try to adjust everything to our idea of our own size we can’t meet and merge with other things, always needing to be adjusted to. We have to become flexible and accommodate to whatever comes along, being free and open, not just waiting for a chair of our own size to come along. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, after you have worshipped Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata you will be able to sit there.”</p><p class="P3">Then the beginner bodhisattvas and great disciples worshipped Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata and were immediately able to sit on the lion seats. </p><p class="P3">A prostration is something to be very thankful for, a way to let go of our ego, a way to become humble. It helps our circulation and also massages our organs. Prostrating is a wonderful thing. “Prostrate to the Tathagata. You will all be able to sit.” And as soon as they prostrated and became humble they were easily able to sit down on the tall thrones.</p><p class="P1">9. Śāriputra said, “Retired scholar, this is unprecedented! Such a small room has accommodated these huge seats, and there is no hindrance in the city of Vaiśālī, nor is there any distortion in the villages and towns of Jambudvīpa, nor in all the worlds of four continents, nor in the palaces of the gods, dragon kings, and demonic spirits.”</p><p class="P3">If we climb to the top of Mt. Rainier we know this experience very well. We finally get all the way to the top of the mountain and we look down below us. The houses appear the size of a sesame seeds. And we know that in each and every house there are pains and there are pleasures. We can see all of them with a huge breadth of vision. But even though we can feel this hugeness of mind, again we get caught by what other people are doing all the time. People who go out into space see the earth spinning below them and they say, “In five minutes we can see the main countries of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam flying by, rolling below us. Why can’t people down there all get along, anyway?” They say they don’t want to return to such a complex world when it doesn’t have to be that way. “But it’s my home, and please, couldn’t we start getting along together!.”</p><p class="P1">10. Vimalakīrti said, “O Śāriputra, the buddhas and bodhisattvas have an emancipation called ‘inconceivable.’ For a bodhisattva residing in this emancipation, the vastness of [Mount] Sumeru can be placed within a mustard seed without [either of them] increasing or decreasing in size. Sumeru, king of mountains, will remain in appearance as before, and the gods of the [heavens of the four heavenly kings and the Trayastriṃśa [Heaven] will not sense or know their own entry [into the mustard seed]. Only those one is trying to save will see Sumeru enter into the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the teaching of inconceivable emancipation.</p><p class="P3">Next Vimalakirti teaches, responding to Sariputra who had been so impressed. Vimalakirti says to Sariputra: “It is not so mysterious that we can take all of this right into our mind.” The Diamond Sutra, says, “Abiding nowhere, awakened Mind arises.” Our mind, which then receives and becomes everything, is able to think and see and hear and perceive, but nevertheless, our mind has no form. Yet we can put everything into a person’s clear mind. This is truly the inconceivable and it is not mysterious; it is regular. When we are holding on to nothing at all, everything can be encompassed and received. It’s the bell, it’s the han, it’s the zazen. How often have we thought that we couldn’t put more in and then we let go and are able to receive and accept it all. But because we often don’t let go as we perceive, we feel this narrowness. As soon as we do let go we feel no more narrowness at all. If we are small, we get restricted; but letting go, we can truly even put Mt. Sumeru into a mustard seed.</p><p class="P1">11. “Also, [a bodhisattva] may cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single pore.</p><p class="P1">“[The bodhisattva does so] without discomforting the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the fundamental characteristics of those great oceans [remain] as before. The dragons, demonic spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into the single pore]. At this, the sentient beings [just mentioned] are not discomforted.</p><p class="P3">Next, the oceans are collected into a pore on the skin in the same way as Mt. Sumeru is put into a mustard seed. Just as when we walk into the library looking for a book we don’t look around and say, “How can I possibly ever read all of these books?” Once there was a priest named Chijo, and he was addressed by a scholar, Daigaku, who said to him, “How come Buddhism is always saying such grandiose  things, making such huge statements?” To which the priest said, “Well, how about you? You’re a great scholar, and you’re called one who has read tens of thousands of books. How is it possible that all those books–he knocked him on the head and said— “How can all of those books possibly fit into a head like this, the size of a small coconut?” </p><p class="P3">To be able to read and receive so many books we have to be able to go beyond any idea of many and few or small and large. Vimalakirti is teaching how, in order to pry us away from being caught on these limiting ideas.</p><p class="P3">This all sounds like bragging, but if we stay small and caught, everything else also gets small. While we think that this is something about things outside of ourselves, it’s a mistake; all of this is right within us. And we see how all of it is only phenomena. If we try to see from our ego we always get stuck in a tight place, but if we open up and go beyond it we can pierce through it all.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti saw through Sariputra’s one moment of wanting a chair and picked up on it. Our body, its emotions–we think we can rely on them but we get confused by phenomena; this is taking us away from the source, which is the Dharma. That which has form is emptiness; that which is emptiness is form. This world and all existence is phenomena. The source of all of it is the Dharma. Since there is no other word or way to put it, some say that it is called something or other but if we don’t know the actuality of it we can get caught on each and every word, label, and every phenomenon in it. If we see in a phenomenal way, we only see the mental version, the ideas and the concepts; these are all phenomena. But the Dharma, when seen clearly, goes beyond even the inconceivable.</p><p class="P3">Five hundred years ago, in Togano lived Myoe no Shonin who wrote:</p><p class="P4">See this one, small, purple violet? </p><p class="P4">This purple color–</p><p class="P4">Who has dyed this flower this beautiful color?</p><p class="P3">This is a purple flower which is not separate from all other life. In it we can find infinite time, infinite space. We have to see this infinite place in this small flower–the inconceivable which is so much more huge than our narrow, mental calculations, a purple which science could not possibly imitate, and what would it want to do that for, anyway. The flower is the Buddha’s truth, but we are so caught by our own opinions about what we like and what we dislike that we get into confusion that never stops.</p><p class="P3">We are not doing zazen to save ourself only but to see how we are not just this small mind. When we see this huge Mind we can’t be restrained by our simply sore legs or a bumpy state of mind. It is not that only we are blind but that the whole world has somehow become blind like that. So here we see that there is a limit to that and we have to go beyond it.</p><p class="P3">What is being taught by Vimalakirti is the same thing we learn by truly doing zazen, but not by never asking when we deeply need to know. We have to sit to where we lose track of our own body and our myriad thinking. The sense of the zendo goes, and we enter deeply into this very instant in which the world has been drunk down completely. Zazen has a huge power. People in the zendo are fifty-three, and not one person there is thinking that I am here; there is this state of mind for everyone. We return to that true awareness that gives birth to mountains and flowers, gives birth to the zendo, to these lives everywhere. And even if we experience this depth, nothing changes, but our zazen opens us up to the possibility of experiencing it.</p><p class="P1">12. “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva residing in inconceivable emancipation who eradicates grasping of the great trimegachiliocosm does so just like a potter grasping a wheel in his right palm: were he to throw it past world-systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, the sentient beings within [that great trimegachiliocosm] would be unaware of where they had gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them would have any conception of having gone and returned, and the fundamental characteristics of this world-system would be as before.</p><p class="P1">13. “Furthermore, Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire kalpa and cause those sentient beings to consider it a kalpa. If there are sentient beings who can be saved through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire kalpa into seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.</p><p class="P3">The previous part was about space in the inconceivable, and now it is about time. For some people thirty minutes of zazen seems like a week or maybe even more because time is so hard to measure; it’s so subjective. That’s why we need a clock or a watch. But it’s not that a clock or a watch is time. Bankei Zenji would call one period of sitting one day; one day is one eon for some people. We are not such experts that we can make our time inconceivable yet. We sit for thirty minutes; we look at this and we see it clearly, this zazen. In the dojo we have a clock which marks the period of time it takes one stick of incense to burn. It can take longer for one stick of incense to burn on a damp day, and it burns faster in dry weather. In the temple bell world as well, time is measured in a particular way. The morning bell is rung when you can see the lines in your palm, because the sun has come up to that degree. And the evening bell is rung when you no longer can see the lines in your palm. You can understand well how this is always changing. It is no problem if things are a little late or if the sight of the person seeing his palm’s lines is different. Another difference is that in the winter we have 40-minute sticks of incense and we burn twelve of them a day in the zendo, while in the warmer months we have 20-minute sticks of incense and we burn eight of them in a day. Our sitting is different in the summer from how it is at other times. For people who are full of thoughts it feels as if it is taking so long for this period to be over. For people not thinking about a lot of things it goes by so fast. To become this place where there is no more time, this is zazen–to know the state of mind beyond time.</p><p class="P3">This place, where we forget time and space completely–only then can we understand how the 1700 koans were used for teaching 1500 years ago and not just given as a quiz. This is Zazen which goes beyond anything to do with time and space. And it is not about getting into a conditioned path or a preconceived notion about a pattern which has just been repeated and becomes automatic. It has to be something which is truly inconceivable.</p><p class="P1">14. “Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation can assemble the ornaments of all the buddha lands in a single country to manifest them to sentient beings.</p><p class="P1">“Furthermore, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and fly to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.</p><p class="P1">“Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can make visible in a single pore all the articles offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions. Also, he can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti continues teaching Sariputra, reiterating the themes that were covered earlier in the section on the Buddha-lands. While the Buddha was deeply and immensely awakened, why does the world stay so deluded? There are mountains and rivers and garbage as well in this world. “Of course,” says the Buddha, “if you stay in this mind that looks from the eyes of discrimination it appears to be a soiled world.” If we instead become able to see deeply in this world–but then, how about a blind person? How would they see a Buddha-land? In this teaching the Buddha gave the truth. Sariputra also saw the whole picture. People without personal agendas and individual subjective views–we have to become like this, like one who can see from this huge view and then not lose it twenty minutes later. </p><p class="P3">It was on this very day ten years ago that we were visited by someone at 8 o’clock in the morning, telling us what had happened at the World Trade Center and sharing that it was indescribable and should be seen on the television, which was brought. Many people who were here doing sesshin at that time, on the same sixth day of sesshin, called home to their family’s cell phones to check on them. But no one left. Everyone stayed, everyone stayed right until the end of the sesshin. Many people said they were able to stay calm and centered because of having stayed here. The woman who had told us at first came back and told how everyone was being upset, watching the television playing the same horrendous scene over and over and over again.</p><p class="P2">Hanson’s Disease</p><p class="P3">The roshi visits an island twice a year in which there used to be a place where people were sent against their will when they had been found to have Hanson’s Disease (leprosy). The people who were sent there were separated from their families; coming there against their wishes, many were so miserable at being sent to this island that they considered committing suicide immediately. On this island the young doctors and nurses care for these painful, damaged bodies, and after a little while the people who are suffering from Hanson’s Disease begin to understand how in fact they’re very fortunate to be there–how fortunate they are to actually be there. They begin to see the dandelions and the violets blooming in the grasses. They begin to see where it is that they actually are. These people who have no fingers, no eyelids, no lips—in the world people turn away from them and think they are monsters, but on the island they are well taken care of and even given spending money. They come there so full of anger and resentment, but then they find their way to being very full of gratitude. This is truly an inconceivable liberation.</p><p class="P1">“Furthermore, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva can without physical harm inhale through the mouth all the winds of the worlds in the ten directions, and the trees outside [the bodhisattva] will not be damaged [by the winds].</p><p class="P1">15. “Also, during the kalpa-ending conflagration of the world-systems of the ten directions, he can take all the fires within his abdomen, and though the fires will be as before he will not be harmed.</p><p class="P2">Blue Cliff Records, Case 29</p><p class="P3">In the Blue Cliff Records, case 29, a monk asked Master Tai Zui, “When the great fiery ending of the world comes, will everything go? Will “it” go, too?” </p><p class="P3">A monk believed the sutras that say that the world will truly end with great fire, great water and then great wind. Millions of years ago this world was born, one celestial body in the Milky Way, continually expanding. But the expansion time will come to an end and it will decrease in power and will be sucked back into the contracting force of the galaxy, and at that time there will be great fire, great floods, and all the land will be covered with water. The great wind will blow and everything will be shattered into pieces and will explode. A monk asked the master about what happens then: “Will ‘this’ also go along?” The master said without hesitation, “It will go along.” </p><p class="P3">The monk was shocked. For what had he been doing all this training to realize Buddha-nature? Wasn’t it all meaningless then? He quickly left the area of Shisensho and visited Master Tosu, to whom he told what had happened and asked him his question. Master Tosu answered the exact same answer. Not only that, but hearing what he’d heard from Master Tai Zui he offered incense in his direction and said what a great thing it was to know that there was a truly awakened master. And then he got angry at the monk’s stupidity for having left that master and told him to go right back to Master Tai Zui, which he did. He hurriedly took another month and went back to Master Tai Zui, but when he got there Master Tai Zui was dead. So he went back to Master Tosu, and when he got there Master Tosu was dead. So while wandering around he had lost two great teachers. “Will it all go?” “It will all go right along with it.”</p><p class="P3">But here what we have to realize is that truth that does <span class="semiBoldItalic">not</span> change–Vimalakirti’s inconceivable liberation. This decaying life energy, this decaying world: the deep awakening within this. The Buddha died, Bodhidharma died. It’s not about emotions or feelings but about our truest source. The truth still generates and regenerates our minds. People hear this and say, “Why bother, if we’re all going to die anyway?” But if we don’t touch on our True nature, then we cannot experience this clearly.</p><p class="P1">“Also, passing beyond buddha world-systems in the lower direction more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, he can take a single buddha land and lift it up in the upper direction, passing beyond world-systems more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River. Like holding a needle or a thorn, he is not inconvenienced [at all by doing so].</p><p class="P1">16. “Also, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva who resides in inconceivable emancipation is able to use the numinous penetrations to manifest the body of a buddha, or to manifest the body of a pratyekabuddha, or to manifest the body of a śrāvaka, or to manifest the body of an Indra, or to manifest the body of a Brahmā king, or to manifest the body of a world lord (i.e., heavenly king), or to manifest the body of a universal ruler.</p><p class="P1">17. “Also, [a bodhisattva can take] all the sounds in the world-systems of the ten directions, high, medium, and low, and can change them into the sounds (i.e., voices) of the Buddha, playing the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self, with all the various Dharmas explained by the buddhas of the ten directions within those sounds, to be heard everywhere.</p><p class="P3">Next we have words from the Kanzeon Sutra–Kanzeon can change into the Bakushi Buddha, a very original buddha, into buddhas that appear in various forms, into Taishaku, the god of the heavens; when that is what is needed to liberate,  a different form is entered into. </p><p class="P3">It can be the form of Benten, or Tenrinjo when that is most useful for bringing forth liberation; then Kanzeon can become that form. It is said that she can become thirty-three varieties of forms; that is how it is written, but that implies that she can become infinite forms. This is also inconceivable. If we are educated in the Way, we can  become able to function in this same multifaceted way, like an actor or actress who knows that the roles they are given to play are already in them, within their own mind. Before they have even been given those roles they know those people and how to become them. Actors who can become completely that role are those who become excellent actors, ones who can cry very easily and have no trouble being very nasty and mean because these acts are all parts of what is already inside of them.</p><p class="P3">Once, in the olden days, there was a movie called “Buddha.” And in this movie of “Buddha,” never was the full-face version of the Buddha shown; it was always a silhouette because they would not want to show a dualistic face that would not be like the face the Buddha would have had. A silhouette was his fulfilled being’s expression. Within human beings, to bring forth our most evolved state of mind is inconceivable.</p><p class="P3">Each and every one of us can bring forth many different roles. But for doing training, to bring out that expression of a person of training is something that all of us can do, says Vimalakirti. As the master poet Sotoba, who trained for so long, has written:</p><p class="P4">The sounds of the valley streams<br/>Are his long, broad tongue.</p><p class="P4">The forms of the mountains <br/>Are his pure body.</p><p class="P4">At night I heard the myriad sutra verses uttered— </p><p class="P4">How can I relate to others what they say?</p><p class="P3">Truly, that pure scenery is the Buddha himself—that mountain scenery which is so brilliant and clear! As Sotoba writes in another place, the willow is the blessed form of Kanzeon, and also uses all the various sounds to express the Buddha’s teaching, manifesting as tears, as cries, as sighs–all the teachings of the Buddha. All sounds that exist are in fact the teaching of the Dharma. This is not imagination but is the activity of the mind. The Buddha has so many various forms; all the sounds of the whole world are the resonance of the Buddha. But because we listen to them from our subjective way of hearing, we get upset when we are criticized, for example. If our dualistic, subjective listening mind is let go of, then we hear every sound there is as that of the Buddha’s teaching. This is also inconceivable.</p><p class="P1">18. “Śāriputra, I have now briefly explained the power of the bodhisattva’s inconceivable emancipation. If I were to explain it extensively a kalpa would be exhausted without completing it!”</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti says that he has taught of the inconceivable liberation. “Now I will tell of clarifying the mind within, teaching about it from the external point of view.” Now is the inner purification process. Our mind source, as the scientists tell us, is from millions of years ago when life first came into being. There have been many phases of evolution since that first came into being. As Dogen Zenji says, we have to become educated from our original state of mind. It may be pure without any preconceived notions, but it is also a lump of flesh with an animal nature, and we then learn and evolve, going through an ego phase and not staying at being newborn.</p><p class="P3">We come with an instinct to learn, however. This is the Buddha-nature. While we can’t divide our mind this way, it is zazen that teaches us to be able to align with that part of ourselves that comes into being a human being who has let go of their animal nature and made stronger that nature which is well educated. While we never know what we will do next, we also work to improve and also to align our mind. We have school education as one way for doing this. According to studies of the human genome, we open to being educated at around four or five, educated into the way of being human. If we miss that opportunity we become more inclined to develop in the way of our animal nature. We know of the Children of Calcutta who were raised by wolves in a cave, so they would bare their teeth and glare, and while they knew no words they could still become very angry and aggressive. Two thousand words would be the usual number of words a young teenager would know, but even though educators attempted to bring these two children back into the human sphere as opposed to that of animal behavior, they could only remember fifty words. They were being given training to bring out their human nature instead of behaving like wolves, but it was a very difficult thing to turn that around.</p><p class="P3">In our minds we have a place that can learn if we are educated, and then that brings forth the wisdom with which we are naturally endowed to liberate others. Zen is what helps bring forth this wisdom, developing our mind and helping with our mind-body becoming one. This is our advanced polishing, and the ability to be able to do this is truly inconceivable.</p><p class="P3">With this, Vimalakirti’s teaching ends, and next we have Makakasho.</p><p class="P1">19. Then Mahākāśyapa, hearing the teaching of the bodhisattva’s inconceivable emancipation, exclaimed that it was unprecedented and said to Śāriputra, “It is as if someone displayed to a blind person all the colors and forms he cannot see. In the same fashion, when all the śrāvakas hear this teaching of the inconceivable emancipation, they are not able to comprehend it. When the wise hear it, who among them would not generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi?</p><p class="P1">“How is it that we have long cut off our capacity [for understanding]? With regard to this Mahayana we are like destroyed seeds. When all the śrāvakas hear this teaching of the inconceivable emancipation, they should all scream out a cry to shake the trimegachiliocosm. All the bodhisattvas should accept this Dharma with great joy.</p><p class="P1">“If there are bodhisattvas who devoutly understand this teaching of inconceivable emancipation, all the congregations of Māras will be unable to do anything to them.” When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand gods all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P3">He was astounded at Vimalakirti’s teaching, and now his teaching also expounds the Dharma. It is just as Vimalakirti has taught us, but we have to have the ears to be able to hear it, for our mind, which is narrow, shuts us down before we’re even able to realize what a great teaching this is. If we try to hear this in a narrow context we could not possibly understand it. If we open our mind to realize this, then in the very opening it is possible to be realized because of the Buddha nature within all beings. Otherwise it is “like a burned and rotten seed” within each of us that is not able to break forth.</p><p class="P3">For the Mahayana, if we simply open our mind to this truth then we can understand and see this. In this way we can see how it is said in the Bible as well, that if a grain of wheat falls to the ground and rots it is not able to bring forth wheat, but if it is saved and planted it becomes wheat. It has a shell which has to go beyond being a shell. This is a small, hard shell, just like the hard shell of ego that surrounds us. When a mother hen produces an egg and sits on it, if the shell is not broken through, the life inside that egg dies and it becomes rotten. We all have this shell of an ego, and then zazen breaks through that shell and gives birth to our true self.</p><p class="P3">So how does this shell break? If we live for a small selfish reason it won’t break. But if we live for all beings it naturally breaks away because that is not ego. Of course everyone naturally wants to be awakened from the origin. We understand this, and we also understand how, at twenty months of age, we are thinking in terms of two, not one. Because of that, an ego comes forth and we use that ego to learn and evolve and make a life. But  also because of that understanding of two, there is conflict. To liberate ourselves from this dualism we have to give birth to a new wisdom, and there is always friction in doing this. Or else we continue protecting our small self forever, never breaking through that shell. We have to decide to use the infinite great energy with which we are endowed from the origin in order to awaken and to awaken all beings. Not just humans, but all life energy. It’s all one life. When we are separate and isolated we feel powerless, but when we connect and unite and know our oneness directly we know how to go beyond that powerlessness and awaken all beings.</p><p class="P1">“If there are bodhisattvas who devoutly understand this teaching of inconceivable emancipation, all the congregations of Māras will be unable to do anything to them.” When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand gods all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P3">As it is written, the purpose of the Buddhas in coming into this world is to reveal this truth, to proclaim this truth, to understand this truth, and to enter this truth. And piercing through that shell, our great wisdom is given birth as well. That is what it means to conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. Our way of living then is truly becoming a way that is inconceivable.</p><p class="P1">20. At that time Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa, “Sir, the majority of those acting as Māra kings in the incalculable asaṃkhyeyas of world-systems are bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation. They manifest themselves as Māra kings through the power of skillful means, to teach sentient beings.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti said that the bodhisattvas would know this teaching as true and their evil ways could not touch them. As Vimalakirti said, don’t be deceived; these only look like devils. They are only assuming the forms of devils to bring others to awakening and guard and guide their Path. Actually they are bodhisattvas in disguise. Usually we think that evil spirits are bad, but they have unusual powers and complex delusions and this brings forth their strong energy, like in the Bible when it is the devil who offers food to Christ when he is fasting, and Christ yells at the devil to be gone. This devil is testing the mind and in doing that cultivating us to go one level wiser and deeper.</p><p class="P2">Rasetsu</p><p class="P3">And then there was Rasetsu [Rakshasa a demonic being], the ogre who ate human flesh. Everything in the world changes; nothing is eternal, not one single thing. That is the truth of this world. This is the song that Rasetsu was always singing: “Everything in the world changes, nothing is eternal, not one single thing. That is the truth of the world.” Then a person of training  named Sessan Doji, said to him, “Hey, Rasetsu, wait! I know that! I know that too, but it is not only that things are decaying. There have to be two more lines to your song; it’s not going to be finished there. It is missing two lines. It is those two lines which are the points I need most to be able to liberate sentient beings. Please tell me those last two lines that you haven’t added onto the song yet.</p><p class="P3">I have spent my whole life searching for this very point, so please tell me. To which Rasetsu answered, “I’m hungry. I can’t talk now.” “Look, Rasetsu! You’re hungry and I don’t need this body, but before I give you my body, please tell me these last lines.” And Rasetsu told him, “If we let go of birth and death–this dualistic view, the view of phenomena that deludes us–we have only to see what is it that sees all of this.” “So that’s it! Now I get it!” The person of the Path cut his finger and with the blood which came from the finger that he cut he wrote down all of the lines, the complete song of Rasetsu, and threw himself into Rasetsu’s mouth. Then Rasetsu disappeared; he turned into Taishakuten, who embraced Sessan Doji and, wanting to help this person of the Path, took him to the heavenly realm. In this way Sessan Doji could learn the final truth for which he had yearned for years. </p><p class="P3">The monk had still been caught on the shadow of dualism, and this is why he needed a teacher that told him how Buddhas and devils are one and the same thing; both are nothing but phenomena. That is how realizing this can liberate us, and that is what Vimalakirti is teaching in this sutra.</p><p class="P3">That dualistic view is what keeps us confused and suffering, always thinking that there are good people and bad people, and discriminating. That is what leaves in us something so hard to get rid of and leaves us unable to become liberated. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us with the mysterious non-duality which is the actual truth.</p><p class="P1">“Also, Kāśyapa, as to the immeasurable bodhisattvas of the ten directions, there may be people who beg them for a hand, foot, ear, nose, head, eye, marrow, brain matter, blood, flesh, skin, bone, village, town, wife and sons, slave, elephant, horse, vehicle, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, sapphire, agate, coral, emerald, pearl, conch shell, clothing, or food.</p><p class="P1">“Beggars such as these are usually bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation, who use the power of skillful means to go test [the bodhisattvas] and make them resolute. Why? Bodhisattvas who reside in the inconceivable emancipation possess the power of awesome virtue and therefore manifest the practice of pressuring, showing sentient beings difficulties such as these. Ordinary people are inferior and lack energy, and they are unable to pressure bodhisattvas in this way. It is like the kick of a dragon or elephant, which is not something a donkey could withstand.</p><p class="P1">“This is called the ‘gate of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas residing in the inconceivable emancipation.’”</p><p class="P3">There are so many kinds of devils! They ask people of the Path for their lives, their legs, their hands, and by doing that they bring this person of the Path into a place of being tested; the bodhisattvas’ awakening to true Mind is strengthened and becomes even more firm. For the devils to do things [to the bodhisattvas] that cannot usually be done are being done in order for the person of the Path to deepen in their Path and become like an elephant on whose path a donkey cannot tread. And in this way they can complete and fulfill their Path. This is an expedient means for bringing deeper wisdom to their awakening to true Mind. This is Vimalakirti’s true teaching.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti makes this teaching with everyone standing up a long time. He has seen each person’s deeply opinionated small self and is saying, “Don’t you want to realize that deeper truth by realizing inconceivable liberation?”</p><p class="P3">And finally even the devils and Maras are liberated. This is the true work of the bodhisattva: to not discriminate between bad people and good people. For this we have been born into this world, not to protect our egoistic small self but to awaken to all beings as one being. No matter what comes forth, to have this kind of hugeness and spaciousness of mind: to not be moved around, and to be able to have the strength of true sight to be able to see devils becoming bodhisattvas–not by our imagination but by resolving people’s weaker places inside. This is the way of the true Dharma.</p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
