At this point Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “How should the bodhisattva view sentient beings?”<span> </span></p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “As if he were a magician seeing a conjured person, so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.</p><p class="P4">“Like a wise person seeing the moon in water,  like seeing the image of a face in a mirror, like a mirage when it is hot,  like the echo of a shout, like clouds in the sky, like water collecting into foam, like bubbles upon water,  like the firmness of the banana tree,  like the prolonged abiding of lightning,  like a fifth element,  like a sixth skandha,  like a seventh sense,  like a thirteenth entrance (āyatana),  like a nineteenth realm (dhātu)—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings. </p><p class="P4">“Like form in the formless realm,  like a seedling emerging from burned grain,  like a stream-enterer’s mistaken view of the body,  like a non-returner’s (anāgāmin) entrance into a womb,  like an arhat’s three poisons,  like a bodhisattva who has achieved forbearance breaking the prohibition against anger, like a buddha’s latent influences of the afflictions,  like a blind man seeing forms,  like the inhalation and exhalation of someone who has entered the concentration of extinction,  like the tracks of birds in the sky, like the child of a barren woman,  like a conjured person generating the afflictions, like waking up in a dream,  like one who has entered nirvana being reborn, like fire without smoke—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.” </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P1">In the Sutra’s seventh section Vimalakirti teaches about how we should see sentient beings. All living things are considered to be sentient, as we read every day in the Four Vows. In Buddhism not only humans but all living beings are sentient–bugs, fish, animals, plants. But we most usually refer to “living beings” as being human beings because they are the sentient beings most familiar to us.</p><p class="P1">Manjusri Bodhisattva was visiting Vimalakirti. All the other bodhisattvas and disciples had been asked by the Buddha to go and see Vimalakirti but, because in past encounters with him, the bodhisattvas and the top disciples of the Buddha had been reprimanded for their triviality and narrow-mindedness in ways that were correct for each one of them, all of the disciples and the bodhisattvas had turned down the Buddha’s request. </p><p class="P1">They had been told that that way of holding their mind was a great source of discrimination, so none of them wanted to go and visit the ailing Vimalakirti. This is why it ended up being Manjusri, the great bodhisattva of wisdom, who had gone for the Buddha to see Vimalakirti. We have just read previously in our teishos about this encounter.</p><p class="P1">Now we have Vimalakirti answering Manjusri about his sickness further. Before, he had said, “I am sick because everyone in society is sick and I have taken on this sick body’s appearance because people are so attached. Because of this attachment, they are sick, and for them I have become sick in this similar physical body.” There was no wall for Vimalakirti between himself and all beings in the world. The world’s suffering was his suffering beyond any division between self and other. But no matter how long, how kind, how big Vimalakirti’s huge love is, the number of sentient beings is so immeasurable that if one were to carry this feeling like a parent—which Vimalakirti did—like a parent who can’t sleep at night when their child is sick, then that person would become sick as well. </p><p class="P1">For Vimalakirti it was everyone’s sickness that was of such great importance to him that he was trying to bring a resolution to it. So he is being asked by Manjusri, “With what eyes should we look upon the sentient beings in society? ‘Because everyone is suffering, I am also suffering.’ How should I see them then?” We all have to have this great love. But if we discriminate, then that is not the truest love and so we have these words of wisdom from Vimalakirti:</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “How should the bodhisattva view sentient beings?”<span> </span></p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “As if he were a magician seeing a conjured person, so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.</p><p class="P1">There are infinite human beings, all suffering; how should we encounter them? A magician is a master of slight of hand who brings people’s concentration to one focus, and then while their focus is held there, he changes things while people are not noticing. In the same way, a magician in one instant manifests form like our body. This is Vimalakirti’s own existence being looked at as well, and for everyone to see it like this. It is showing that there is no such thing as a fixed substance or form existing. The same thing is taught in the Heart Sutra where it speaks of all of our senses and then how there are none of them. The many trillions of cells in our body—Vimalakirti is referring to all of these and how we use them, thinking that we are alive, thinking that we are walking, thinking that we are doing, thinking that we are acting. </p><p class="P1">However, it is all appearance, a dream, a phantom. And when we take these things as real, believing in them as existing, we then find that not to be the case, and here is where people suffer. While this is how it is for each and every person, we still get pulled around by our sense perceptions and get confused by thinking that what we are perceiving in our senses is actually existing. So no matter what we do we are always seeing endlessly in a mistaken way until we do, truly, actually realize. </p><p class="P1">Otherwise we are like someone struggling in a bad dream, unable to wake up from this deluded perception of what’s happening. Of course this is only because we are attached to things that this happens. When we can awaken to the actuality we don’t have to continue seeing it in this way. We have to realize that it is all a dream.</p><p class="P2">Seijo and her Sister</p><p class="P1">In the T’ang Dynasty in China there was a very popular novel by Sokuten Bukko about a very wealthy father named Choitsu who had a beautiful, bright daughter named O-Sen (Seijo). She had a good friend named O-Chu from when she was very young. Both of them were children of good birth, handsome and beautiful; they would play together, and everyone would say how beautiful they were as children and what a great couple they would be when they grew up. O-Sen and O-Chu took this as a given that they would get married and someday raise a family. They became closer and closer as they became older. Choitsu, O-Sen’s father, unconcerned about their intimate connection, prepared to find his daughter a husband of good birth, but whenever this was mentioned, O-Sen would become more and more depressed and dark. And O-Chu, also depressed at the idea of O-Sen marrying someone else, decided to leave for a different city and make a life there on his own. So he went off by boat. But O-Sen could not stand the idea of his leaving, and she followed him. She followed him all the way to Koshu, and at twilight O-Chu heard his name being called from behind. It was impossible; he had just arrived there and knew no one! But from behind appeared O-Sen, who had followed him, and he joyfully received her to live together in this land of Shoku. </p><p class="P1">For five years they lived together and had a child. But after about five years O-Sen became very gloomy and wanted to see her father whom she had left and not seen for the whole interim. Her husband said that he had had the same feeling, that they should go back and apologize that he had taken her away. They decided to take their child and go to see her father and apologize.</p><p class="P1">When they reached the port, O-Chu first went to Choitsu’s house to tell him what had happened and apologize, leaving his wife and their child in the boat. He knocked and when the door opened–maybe the maid had been out for the day–it was Choitsu himself who saw O-Chu and said it had been five years and how had he been? </p><p class="P1">O-Chu said, “I’ve come to apologize that I took your daughter.” And the father said, “What are you talking about, you took my daughter? My daughter O-Sen? She’s in the back room sleeping! She’s been depressed for the past five years and won’t talk and hasn’t been seeing anyone. I’m getting older and I’m very concerned about what to do about this daughter. Are you sure you aren’t mistaken?” To this O-Chu said, “No. I’ve known your daughter well since childhood; I’m not mistaken. I’ll bring her and you can see, and see our child as well.” Then when he brought O-Sen to the door of her father’s home, at that very same instant the O-Sen from the back room who had been sleeping, gloomy and depressed for five years, came forth. And she and the O-Sen who had just arrived from the boat became one.</p><p class="P1">This story was used by Master Goso Hoen who asked his monks, bullying them and attacking them with this difficult question, “Which of these is the real O-Sen?” Master Goso Hoen Zenji puts forth this question for all of us! Similarly, Master Rinzai says, “In this five-foot lump of red flesh there is a true person of no rank, always coming in and out of all of the orifices. If you haven’t seen it yet, see it now!”See it now! Everyone uses these eyes and these ears—to be able to know that even so there is still no form and no shape! </p><p class="P1">Yet we are happy when we are happy, we are sad when we are sad. We are very freely operating human-ness that has been able to become the flowers and the rivers and the moon and the sun. And with our ears, the songs of the birds, the sounds of the wind, the sounds of the bell, people’s voices. And with this nose, all of the scents and the fragrances. For this mouth, all of the flavors and tastes. With the body, feeling cold and feeling hot. Our body is truly able to pierce through and experience past, present and future! We live that! And yet there is nothing fixed about what is manifesting; we give birth to a huge world. This is the life of a human being.</p><p class="P1">We have these five senses and from them comes our idea of what our human character is. But since we are always thinking that we are something that is acting in an absolute way, we limit our true mind in that way.<span> </span></p><p class="P1">It is just as if we are staying in a sleepy, vague, play about our mind. It is not that we have two sides but that we have a physical side which is included in this greater side; we are not limited by this physical side alone. In our zazen we can let go of all of these senses of being only a human body and all of its sensations and realize this huge, wide open world, this greater Mind which is unlimited. And for realizing this directly we do zazen. This huge, wide open freedom is so often left unrealized!In this way Master Goso Hoen is saying not to get caught on this small body which we are simply borrowing, when we could be giving birth to great joy and freedom! He is not meaning that there is no need for this physical body, but that there is no need to be caught on it as absolute, or to be caught on it in terms of thinking of it as being something which is good or bad, winning or losing. But rather, to really know its greater wisdom and see that our small thoughts are not our absolute functioning. </p><p class="P1">To awaken our true functioning and realize our greater life. To not just see with our eyes, thinking that is all there is, but to open up our deepest wisdom which can liberate others’ suffering. And with this huge, wide open awakening, to just see how things had been until then perceived as if in a narrowing dream. Then we can experience the actual freedom. These things like sickness and weakness of ki we thought we had—when we see this from the bigger picture we understand that while we may be affected by them they are not who we are. This is the Buddha Dharma.</p><p class="P1">After five years living away, O-Sen and the O-Sen from the back drawing room—these two instantly became one, a huge One: the one who gives birth to the sun, the moon, the flowers, the mountains, from this huge Mind. When we realize this we see that although we have many encounters each and every moment, each and every one is not done from some desperate, stuck way of seeing but always opening to infinite new possibilities. This is human’s liberation.</p><p class="P1">“As a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water”–those who see it as the reflection of the moon in the water do not think it’s the moon, they see it as a reflection of the moon in the water and just a reflection. When we are having a hard, desperately difficult feeling time, we know it will be over–like seeing that which has passed before, like seeing that the reflection in the mirror always fades. In each and every moment, in each and every situation, we can realize that.“Like a wise person seeing the moon in water,  like seeing the image of a face in a mirror, like a mirage when it is hot,  like the echo of a shout, like clouds in the sky, like water collecting into foam, like bubbles upon water,” </p><p class="P1">In the flimsy heat waves that come from the ground when the weather starts getting warm–the heat waves that look as if there is something humid coming from the ground that does not really exist–like an echo being called from far away which appears to be a sound that someone is making, like a mass of clouds in the sky, like a mist from which rain then forms: in this way phenomena are to be perceived. This does not mean to see things that exist as unimportant because they are transient, but to see that we are not fixed and we are not trapped, and to not get caught on an idea that we are something small and limited. It’s not that these things don’t exist, but to not hold onto them in a small way as a fixed existence; rather, to hold to the infinite regenerative ability of being human, and to see this wisdom which embraces all and with which we are all endowed! We are able to realize unthinkable wisdom! In this way Vimalakirti is telling us.</p><p class="P1">For different people there are different ways to live. Some people go straight ahead, simply. Some are more apparently clumsy and always bumping into things. But we can’t be in despair, nor can we slide over things because they’re simple. Mind is huge and infinite and has many ways to live, and we can’t lose sight of our infinite potential. This is what Vimalakirti is saying–that in each moment we have to see what is the best way to live; he is not saying that because it is transient it is melancholy. Even while we may live through some time of great confusion and challenge, to realize that we have infinite wisdom and creativity. This innate, infinite, inner wisdom, this is the universe we live in. To know this infinite universe and know that this is our true base. To see that there is no end to this and to see it widely and hugely!</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti says that those who are confused and deluded in the world—this is the way they should be regarded. We usually think of those with physical challenges and offer them everything we possibly can. Any person in the front line of caregiving feels this huge pressure to give everything possible, and we can see how many who are working there get burned out from living this way. Vimalakirti tells us the best way to regard all living beings, to hold one’s mind in these situations–including those who are on the front line of trying to give help to people who are physically challenged. It is like seeing a magician, a sleight of hand artist, where one’s attention is whisked away to a different direction and in one instant the scene changes, a trick is performed. It is like that instant that we should perceive this, but then instantly perceive the moon reflected in the water. </p><p class="P1">Like that story of the old pond in the woods right near a forest full of monkeys, who always live in groups: the monkey boss looked at the old pond and saw that into the pond the moon had fallen. He was astonished. The moon had fallen into the pond! It was their moon that made their night bright with light, and now it had fallen into the pond; it would never be bright at night again. This couldn’t be! They had to return it to the sky no matter what. So the boss monkey led them, and all the monkeys made a big chain holding arm to arm. By grabbing hands they made a chain from the top of a tree, and just as they had only a short distance to go to reach the moon that had fallen into the pond, the weight of so many monkeys pulled the tree’s branch down and they all fell in and drowned. It was only that this moon had been reflected in the pond, like the heat waves on a pavement on a spring day that have no substance. </p><p class="P1">Or like an echo in the mountains with no person speaking it. Or like clouds in the sky which are always passing and transient. Or if we get caught, stuck on an idea, it’s like a ball of foam on the water. We can see that these things cannot be held onto. </p><p class="P2">Heshiro</p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5">“Like the appearance and disappearance of a bubble of water”....</p><p class="P1">We have the Rohatsu Exhortations of Master Hakuin, and in it is written the story of Heshiro, a wealthy man in the village of Ihara who had given the money to have a statue of the Immovable Fudo Bodhisattva built.  This statue was being placed by the village near a waterfall, and on the day of its unveiling they all sat to honor it. Heshiro, being the main supporter, sat in the place of the guest of honor, by where the waterfall fell. As he sat there as the feast was served, Heshiro couldn’t help but notice that as the water fell, many bubbles came forth and moved downstream. He’d seen this waterfall many times, but he’d never before noticed  these bubbles coming down the waterfall. Some of them would go two feet and then pop, some of them would go a few inches and pop, some of them would go five or six feet and pop, but eventually all of the bubbles–every single last one that came down the waterfall–all of them popped. And then he realized suddenly that this </p><p class="P1">was just like people and their lives ending. And it hit him that “just like that, I’m going to die, too, just like one of those bubbles popping!” There are children, mere babies, that die. There are school children, and even at that age, some of them die. Some people, at the height of their work in society, doing the best possible job they could have wanted, and right there and then they die. Some people live to a ripened old age, and they die then. But everyone does die. No matter what kind of a strong, well-developed human being it is, for every single person that eventually fades. This is what Heshiro realized. He felt this so deeply, he panicked in response.</p><p class="P1">A plantain tree from the southern countries has huge leaves. And if we take off these plantain leaves one at a time, if we unfurl them, removing one leaf after the next leaf, we find there’s no trunk or core inside of them. This whole tree is only furled leaves. Humans have splendid looking bodies, but nothing there that lasts–like that brightness of a flash of lightning, immediately over like our life span relative to the millions of years that have passed before it.</p><p class="P1">There are the four elements of the cosmology of ancient India–earth, wind, fire, and water, which make up all of the material world. Fire, our body’s warmth, the earth’s heat. Wind, the always changing weather, our breathing. Elements are our base, but earth, wind, fire, and water, have one more, a fifth, and that is emptiness. It is that emptiness into which those elements fade when they are not coming together to build something material. These elements gather and then scatter and return to that empty space. The four elements make up all of the objects in the universe, but emptiness, it has no being to it. It is to this emptiness that all elements return because they are only phenomena.</p><p class="P1">Or it is like our six senses and their six perceptions and the activities that come from those perceptions such as, “I’d like to take that flower home. It smells so good!” But in these senses there is no further sense given. This gathering of senses is empty. There are only five aggregates–form, sensation, perception, mental formation, and consciousness–but no sixth. We have several primary emotions that number six. But the number seven is also emptiness. And so is this true of the twelve perceptions and memories as written in the Heart Sutra. We see a red flower and remember, “This is a flower that is red.” And while we have those three sets–three memory sets for each of the six senses, making eighteen–the nineteenth is always empty. The bodhisattvas look at the world, and if they don’t see it as phenomena, they won’t be seeing it correctly. But when people see the way things look like this or they hear this way of perceiving, they say, “How melancholy! How lonely and sad!” Anyone will see this as so fragile and empty, but without seeing it in this way also, there is no way to truly liberate humankind.</p><p class="P1">It seems that Vimalakirti is speaking about things in such a sad and lonely way. However, today there are more than six billion people in the world and they each have their own individual way of perceiving. If each of us pushes what we want most for ourselves, of course this will end up in a lot of conflict and in the resources of this earth becoming exhausted. Maybe it will work while we can get what we want, but when that’s over it will come to great conflict. Two thousand five hundred and fifty years ago the wisdom of the Buddha came forth to guide us in this situation, teaching that there is no personal single, ego but that the billions of people are one life energy. Seeing it this way it is not melancholy; to see in this huge, expansive way, or we cannot truly see clearly. This is the wisdom of the Buddha Dharma, and without it we will, of course, end up in conflict.</p><p class="P1">We can’t attempt to completely discard personal ego. But rather, to acknowledge the one life energy of all beings and bring the benefit of that acknowledgement into focus; then our wisdom is born. It’s not only about a world with life and death, but to also see beyond that life and death, to see that birth and death as one continuum of that one life energy. The ancient universe has been continuously giving birth to it, and within it there are phenomena which are endlessly transforming. To see it like this or we will continually be misunderstanding; this is the wisdom of the Buddha, teaching us how there is no fixed, absolute, personal ego. If we try to succeed only on the basis of our ego, we will always fall into despair if we fail. This is what keeps us in suffering.</p><p class="P2">Bodhidharma &amp; Emperor Wu</p><p class="P1">Bodhidharma’s arrival in China was excitedly anticipated by the Emperor Wu, who wanted to tell him about all of the things he had done to support Buddhism in China. He told him about all the temples he’d built, the monks he’d ordained, the sutras he’d translated, and he asked Bodhidharma about what merit he had earned. To that, Bodhidharma replied, “There’s no merit in that.” He wasn’t saying that the emperor’s efforts were bad. He was saying that instead of being bright and clear from having worked so hard, he was caught on being praised for having done it. We have no need to hold on to such thoughts, but we don’t want to miss a chance for being praised. This is our weak place, and the Buddha helps us out with it. This is how we can be led and helped by his showing us the bigger picture.</p><p class="P1">The moon last night was bright, huge, and expansive, full of shining moonlight. As the ancients poetized about, under the chill night moonlight, doing zazen with not a single person passing by we melt into oneness with that bright, radiant moonlight. The wind blows. We feel as if we are one with nature. Becoming the wind we are one with the heavens and earth. We become that wind, we become that moonlight. We lose track of whether we are shining or the moonlight is shining, we are just this huge, expansive life energy of our being alive. Even if we know nothing of Buddhism, to once in our lifetime experience this hugeness of becoming one, melting into the heavens and earth completely, not only staying as a small, limited individual! </p><p class="P1">Three thousand years ago they were seeing this very same moon, and three thousand years from now they’ll be seeing this very same moon. We have the place within us, within each of us–maybe dogs and cats don’t have that place–to see with this huge state of mind. This is wisdom. It is not just being intoxicated, but to realize this very life energy and Mind which is who we all are.</p><p class="P1">If we were to say what zazen is, it would be about realizing this huge Mind. Maybe there are difficult challenges in the beginning with our legs and our sitting, but we move through those. And even if there is no great, splendid moonlight and there are times when life is difficult with our work, with our relationships, and we see that as an individual in this world we may be challenged, nevertheless we are also this huge Mind as well. </p><p class="P1">Words and phrases and studies show us what we are in some ways, but there is this huge Mind as well which is beyond words and phrases and any kind of calculation. This is what Vimalakirti wants us to know. We are not limited and isolated; it is our truth that we are this huge, enormous, spacious Mind. As one of the ancients, Reisha Shibi Zenji, has said, ”This huge world is my eye.” And as another, Jo Hoshi, said, “This world and I are one and the same root. Everything in this world and I are one.” We are this mind that perceives like this! </p><p class="P1">We all have common experiences and we all have various other experiences that differ, and it is difficult to erase many of them that are very hard. But if we realize this huge, enormous Mind, seeing from there, we don’t need to repeat the same mistakes twice. This is not about being saved by God or being saved by a buddha. Let in this huge, enormous Mind in order to purify and to clarify our unskillful ways! </p><p class="P1">This huge Mind: to know that we live in this great Mind, and then we don’t get caught on the phenomena that are always passing by, and we can easily let go of our own anger, greed and ignorance. We have to awaken to this great Mind, and when we do we will melt away our insecurity, our pain and our suffering. We are born as this mind; it is our true source. We have only lost track of it by mistake. To remember this and to realize it again we need to awaken.</p><p class="P4">“...like the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm; </p><p class="P1">Here Vimalakirti continues to describe our attachments, the first being that of the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm. We have the three realms: the realm of desires, the realm of form, and the realm of the formless from which we perceive things. One who sees a flower and wants to sell it for profit, that’s the realm of desire. One who sees a flower and wants to study it–that’s the world of form. One who sees a flower and wants to write a poem or song about it–that is the formless realm of poets and artists. Just as there are these three realms in this same world, though we see the same object, people see it in many different ways. Some see it in a formless or even a spiritual way, some see it as real, capable of being perceived by our senses, and some from an attachment to it—they see it in a way that they want to hold on to it.</p><p class="P4">“Like form in the formless realm,  like a seedling emerging from burned grain,  like a stream-enterer’s mistaken view of the body,  like a non-returner’s (anāgāmin) entrance into a womb,  like an arhat’s three poisons,  like a bodhisattva who has achieved forbearance breaking the prohibition against anger, like a buddha’s latent influences of the afflictions,  like a blind man seeing forms,  like the inhalation and exhalation of someone who has entered the concentration of extinction,  like the tracks of birds in the sky, like the child of a barren woman,  like a conjured person generating the afflictions, like waking up in a dream,  like one who has entered nirvana being reborn, like fire without smoke—so should a bodhisattva view sentient beings.” </p><p class="P1">No living growth can be found in a rotten seed. A once-returner is one who does not want to return and yet has still got greed, anger and ignorance–like a childlike person who is empty-minded (which is the ideal of the Way of the Buddha Dharma) but who is still hanging onto things. Like a person who has no depth  of  breath in their meditation practice and is just breathing in and out. Like a bird that leaves no traces in the sky but is suddenly leaving traces in this world. If we see that there is this huge Mind, then our sense of phenomena no longer leaves those traces. Like saying that the wooden puppet Pinocchio would have desires, or to have a something left remaining that exists after a dream, or to have smoke where there is no fire. </p><p class="P1">In this way Vimalakirti tells how to liberate our attached mind by not being drunk down by phenomena. In the same way, to not be caught on our typical, usual views of the narrow, limited mind, and when we feel great sympathy or empathy or wanting to help someone, to not get drowned in those feelings either. When we get caught and stuck in our feelings of wanting to help, we get intoxicated by them so easily. In doing that we make even more difficulties for others when what we’re trying to do is help. We have to get free from all of these perceptions that are based on our own narrow idea of what we are. And for doing that we have to keep away from being caught on appearances.</p><p class="P1">We get caught on each and every phenomenon and then cannot see and function from a greater, all-inclusive point of view. One of the astronauts on the Apollo 9 mission was Russell Schweickart who was the father of one of the Roshi’s long ago disciples. Rusty Schweickart came to Japan to see his newly born grandson, and he also came to visit Sogen-ji and told the Roshi that when doing a docking experiment on a mission in the early days he had realized that we human beings standing on this globe, on this planet, only see the earth as two-meter-tall beings relative to the horizon. We see each other in that way also. Whereas if we see the planet from the astronaut’s viewpoint: this Earth which flies by so quickly, rotating completely in five minutes; Buddha’s country passes, Christ’s country passes, all these go whirling by, and on the face of this Earth there are all of us people together and they are arguing all the time! We are taking for granted that our small views are correct. But if we were to leave this planet, where would we exist? We need to see that clearly. The Buddha did not need to leave the planet to see it this way; he saw with this same wisdom and he saw how important it is to see from this huge perspective. That is what Vimalakirti is teaching, that what is most important is wisdom.</p><p class="P4">2. Mañjuśrī said, “If a bodhisattva views sentient beings in this fashion, how should he practice sympathy?” Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who views [sentient beings] in this fashion should think to himself, ‘I should explain the Dharma for sentient beings in this fashion, and this will constitute true sympathy.”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti speaks of how, with all the suffering beings, we mustn’t be attached to their pain and suffering. That which they are manifesting as pain and suffering we are confusing with the phenomenon of their apparent sickness, and that makes them suffer even more and take longer to get better. So while there may be an appearance of sickness, we shouldn’t think of them as a person who is sick and always feel that they are a person who is needing our help. We should be always fresh and always fresh again, or they will get even sicker because of our way of seeing them. This is an important function of bodhisattvas in the world: to not be deceived by appearances. It is not about a mental view of sick or healthy, but to see from the view of the huge, expansive Mind, or we will be fooled by their phenomena. Vimalakirti says this from many angles here. We can’t look at society from our emotions.</p><p class="P1">If we see this all as phenomena, then won’t we lose our intention to help them compassionately? Vimalakirti is teaching that all this sickness and health are all phenomena. But if we see that it’s only phenomena, then does it makes us not feel compassion toward them? This is what Manjusri is asking Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P1">First, Vimalakirti responds that that which appears as sickness gets confused because from the origin these manifestations are not actual. How can we liberate people from this? If there are symptoms of a cold, for example, we see those symptoms, but they are merely phenomena being manifested. That doesn’t change the person and the true nature of the person who is manifesting them. When the cold is over, the person is not changed. Vimalakirti is telling us to teach them things like this. Cancer, AIDS, there are so many things that medicine cannot cure yet. But Vimalakirti is saying to tell people they are this very healthy Original Mind no matter what is manifesting, and not to say, “Oh you poor thing! Currently, one of the Roshi’s disciples is in this very situation and the roshi sends him all of these teishos. </p><p class="P1">People are always trying to tell him what he should do to take care of his symptoms, to comfort him, but he doesn’t want to hear it. He feels that they’re all pushing him into becoming a sick person by considering him in that way; he feels very pressured by this quality of attention and doesn’t want to see people very much because this is how he’s being addressed. He appreciates them coming to visit him very much, but while he’s only being told it once by each person–they’re all only telling him once about his being ill–he’s hearing it over and over again by everyone he encounters. And even if we don’t think that we’re sick, we begin to think we are from being told it that many times. It is important to be able to realize and address a person’s healthier part.</p><p class="P2">Muso Kokushi</p><p class="P1">In Kyoto at the temple of Tenryu-ji, the founder Muso Kokushi, was asked many questions by the younger brother of Ashikaga Takauchi, who was Ashikaga Tadayoshi. These questions and their answers were collected in a collection called “Conversations in a Dream.” If we are doing training, Tadayoshi asks, wouldn’t we be able to know about suffering? And Muso Kokushi answers, “People in the world think they are suffering, but that is only like a dream.” That people think they are suffering is only because people <span class="T1">think</span> that they are suffering. If someone is having a bad dream, then someone next to them would shake them awake and say, “Hey! Wake up! It’s only a bad dream!”</p><p class="P1">We imagine that we are sick or that we are very poor, and while others agree with this by sympathizing or overly empathizing with us, we ourselves have a hard time remembering that this is only phenomena, and we get more and more attached to this phenomena that we dream we are experiencing and going through. A sick person is told this doctor is the best or this medicine is what they should to be taking, but that is not what you would call healing them. It could be only making their ego stronger around this when to help let go of this ego is the work of the bodhisattva. We think we are comforting them but we are actually strengthening their ego’s attachment to being in this situation. No matter what situation, to see how fortunate we are to be alive, to be here today. To awaken to this is today’s way of liberation.</p><p class="P1">The tree’s buds are swelling in this Spring light’s soft rays, and if we can see it like this–a fine awakened view–suffering is a dream. Awakening people to that, bringing their attention to the actuality of the perception of their five senses as they receive the sight of those Spring buds swelling and that Spring light shining, to the joy of these perceptions, not attending to the pain and suffering! To show them the actuality of this joy, this is true compassion. How often do we see things suddenly and think, “Wow! I was really in a dream! I was just seeing that as if I was in a dream!” To awaken people from that and to not get overly empathetic and make it even worse for someone who perceives himself as someone suffering.</p><p class="P1">In fact, life and death are only divided by a thin piece of paper. To see that clearly and to be thankful for being alive today, for today’s life energy that is mysteriously supported by so many; yet,how fragile that life energy is—it could be gone by tonight. We have received these five senses to use to taste and feel the truth of today’s life energy, not to be worrying about what is going to be coming. Our bodies, this world, are changing in every single second. If we see that as melancholy it is because we are caught on phenomena. Not only to have that view but to see that we are alive, and realize that deeply. Not to be caught on transiency as something that is melancholy, and to see it only as that which makes us have a hard time and makes it difficult for us to know this deep gratitude for being alive in this very moment. We think, “I am suffering so much more than anyone else!” To awaken someone to the great joy of being alive at this very moment, that is true compassion. Vimalakirti is teaching this clearly here.</p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who views [sentient beings] in this fashion should think to himself, ‘I should explain the Dharma for sentient beings in this fashion, and this will constitute true sympathy.</p><p class="P4">“‘I should practice the sympathy of extinction, because of the absence of anything generated; practice the sympathy of no-heat, because of the absence of the afflictions; practice the sympathy of sameness, because of the sameness of the three periods of time; practice the sympathy of nondisputation, because of the absence of generation;”</p><p class="P1">It is not bad that we feel we have to do something for someone who is suffering. But trying to fix them is not the best way to be with them compassionately. Rather, to see them as we see our own face in the mirror. We experience what they are going through as if it is our own pain, our own experiencing, and then we can intuitively move, knowing spontaneously what to do just as if it was our own insecurity, our own pain. Not with an idea of, “Now what should I do for this person? What could I possibly do for them?” in a separated, non-intimate way. Because we can feel their pain as our own we can know directly what it is that needs doing. The sun shines everywhere. It is never worrying about which place it should now shine. There may be clouds that block it, but it’s always shining without thinking about, “Shall I shine down here, or shall I shine a little over there?” Because we feel another as our own energy and our own pain, we leave our ego out of it and we move intuitively—not because we think we should be doing something or trying to figure out what the right thing is. We are at one with them in a quiet way, not all excited to see what we can possibly do to help them right away, right now. We can see in a peaceful way.</p><p class="P1">We know about these kinds of peace demonstrations that claim that peace is the best and then end up in violence. How strange to anyone watching people carrying peace signs and fighting during the demonstration! People get excited and want to help, but their way of giving help puts so much pressure on the person receiving the help. Then if that person says, No, they don’t want that help, the visitor goes home with hurt feelings, feeling that they weren’t heard. The Buddha’s compassion is the same for all. We feel it not only for our own children or for people and animals that we feel are ours, but for all things–for cows, for dogs, for horses—equally we feel it. We feel that compassion all the way through the present, the past, and the future. </p><p class="P1">If the person is suffering, then we need to respond intuitively and directly to that suffering, and in that there is no past, present and future. In this kind of deep compassion and love it’s not about time. And we don’t need to be accepted or thanked for our help. The bodhisattva is always in equilibrium, and there can be no conflict in our mind when we are manifesting and coming forth from true compassion. This is what Vimalakirti is saying.</p><p class="P4">“Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high resolve unbreakable, like a diamond;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of no-heat, because of the absence of the afflictions;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of sameness, because of the sameness of the three periods of time;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nondisputation, because of the absence of generation;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonduality, because of the nonconjunction of interior and exterior;</p><p class="P1">If we look at things in a melancholy way we may think there is no future, but if we are not caught in dualism we are experiencing everything, and we can see it all as a manifestation of Buddha nature. If we are deeply rooted in that awareness there is no being caught on phenomena. While we are seeing things we are not being caught on whether they are male or female, good or bad, sick or healthy. This is how Buddha nature truly manifests. Compassion comes forth spontaneously from our true nature. We see as if it is only a reflection in a mirror of our own face, and we accept things exactly as they are, without any dualistic perception added on whatsoever.</p><p class="P1">If we see another person and think, “I must do something! There must be something I have to be doing! What should I be doing?” then we will dualistically perform what seems to be a helpful act. Rather, it has to be done from the most clearly seeing place where we see another as one’s self with no separation. Whether the person realizes it or not cannot be our concern; we do it because we have to, from this place of nowhere at all where there are no desires, no plans, and no agendas. Not needing them to appreciate our doing it, not depending on being thanked for it and praised for it. If we have no agenda we will not try to force someone to receive it or see our way of helping as the best way for someone else.</p><p class="P1">As the Sixth Patriarch said, “From the origin there is not one single thing.” We have to experience it in this way also. As we have read earlier in this same text, if our mind is clear, then everything becomes clear, with no discrimination, no distinction. This is true, deep compassion, like today’s huge, bright blue sky, compassion for all people, wide open, all inclusive. This activity is truest compassion.</p><p class="P1">Ummon Bun’en Zenji, the founder of the Ummon line, once said to his disciples, “The world is so vast and so wide, so why at the sound of the bell do we go to the hondo and put on our robes?” [Gateless Gate#16] Look up at the huge sky! So why do you sit zazen when four small bells ring? And when the bell is sounded, why do we start sutras? Why do we do it? Zen is vicious; it leads us into doing something and then leads us to question and doubt why we are doing this: What is it that is doing this, and why?</p><p class="P1">Master Bankei, who lived 300 years ago, wrote that the True Master is the name for everything that exists wherever we are. Not to be rigid and tense no matter where we are, no matter the circumstance, is the True Master. This is huge freedom! We can usually do it at home when we relax, but to be able to do that anywhere we go, that is the truest, greatest freedom. </p><p class="P5">Every single person in all of these three realms is my child. </p><p class="P5">Every place that there is in these three realms is my home. </p><p class="P1">To see it in this way is to be the True Master of the world, sleeping and waking comfortably anywhere. To be able to be that Master and to be able to realize it in every single situation; this is our True Master to be freely used wherever we are. Not to be using it conditioned by some idea of how our small self thinks it should be, but instead wondering who is using those senses, not thinking there has to be an “I” there. To use them beyond and without that “I.”</p><p class="P1">Further, Master Bankei has said that our parents only gave birth to our true Buddha Mind. That is not something that has any limits. It is not something which is confined by preconceived notions. “That Unborn Buddha nature! Everyone hears me speaking,” said Master Bankei—they have come to hear him—“but behind, the birds are singing, the wind is blowing; we didn’t come to hear birds singing and wind blowing, and yet it enters our ears. We hear it, we perceive it. We naturally hear that.” Everything in the world is not something that happens because we plan it to happen. That which receives whatever happens, naturally—that is the True Master. But because we use the world of mental ideas instead of our True Master, we stay hard and stuck. The Buddha nature is just like a mirror, directly receiving and perceiving.</p><p class="P1">This pure nature does not manifest without the deep activity of wisdom coming forth. That wisdom comes forth from the non-dualistic Buddha nature, and we do zazen to realize and cultivate this because often our experience and our awareness bring us into dualism and then we are not acting freely. For this we want to know the deeper truth of our actual experience. For this we all have to return to our huge, original Mind which perceives directly both pain and suffering. But it cannot then be filtered through our ego. This seems simple, but it is not. We have to first deeply return to that true nature, and for this we have osesshin.</p><p class="P1">Up until this point it has been about how voidness gives birth to compassion—the Void, that holding on to nothing at all in our mind, no opinion about something, no preconceived notion. From there comes the truest compassion–the will of the heavens and earth, it could even be said. </p><p class="P1">We have the story about the emperor Wu. He was waiting in China when Daruma Daishi came, and he asked Daruma Daishi, “What is the ultimate truth of the Dharma?” To this Daruma Daishi responded, “Only emptiness, nothing holy.” Emperor Wu was in fact a very adept scholar of Buddhism, and he had seen to the ordination of many people, built temples, and translated sutra books. He knew the Way of the ordained, the Way of the Bodhisattva, and here he asks about his merit for having done all of those things, as well as the question of what is their highest truth. To this, Daruma Daishi answered simply, “Only emptiness, nothing holy.” Speaking truthfully, he said that there would be no merit from any of this. The emperor Wu continued, not necessarily satisfied with the answer, and said, “I believe that you are a Buddha who has come here from India, but tell me, who are you really?” To this, Bodhidharma answered, “I don’t know.” In this way the emperor had no further place to land any more questions for Bodhidharma. Emperor Wu hadn’t a place to go with that.</p><p class="P1">But in fact there is nothing more truthful for any human to answer than to say this: “I don’t know.” Only collected secondhand information could replace it, when we each have been endowed from the origin with the being of the way of the heavens and earth. We have eyes, but no one ever had to teach us how to use those eyes. We have ears; no one had to teach us how to hear. We have a mind and no one has ever had to teach us how to use it to understand. We wonder what we are seeing and we learn that it is red and a flower, but no one had to teach us how to see that flower. We learn that that which is making that sound which is called barking, is a dog. But we don’t need to be taught how to hear that dog. To directly perceive pain and suffering we don’t have to be taught. We all have the ability to directly perceive sadness or suffering; we don’t have to be taught that by anyone. We know without explanation what it is to be insecure or to be sad; we feel these things spontaneously. Vimalakirti talked about these things, and now it changes tone.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nondestruction, because of the ultimate exhaustion [of the characteristics of sympathy];“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of resoluteness, because of indestructibility; practice the sympathy of purity, because of the essential purity of the dharmas;</p><p class="P1">If we don’t drink water and breathe, we can’t live. In the same way that a baby needs to breast feed to stay alive, these are our instincts, they are necessary. But if we get attached to them, overly attached to them and caught on them, they become desires, and when we can’t have what we think we need, we react. We get stuck on that reaction, we get angry, and the behavior that we manifest when we’re angry is ignorant. It happens to us without our even knowing it. And then we end up with greed and anger and ignorance. While these instincts are necessary for us to live, when we get overly desirous of anything, then we get confused and we make problems for people around us. </p><p class="P1">It is the arhat who has purified these instincts, not turning them into desires or anger and ignorance. The Buddha did the training of the arhat when he was on Dantokusan Mountain. For six years he purified. When those instincts were settled by doing this, from there came his deepest compassion. Our personal desires and opinions have to be let go of, and then we are greatly, spontaneously, compassionate. This is the way that Vimalakirti says it.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of no extremes, because of its being like space; practice the sympathy of an arhat, because of the destruction of the “bandits” of the fetters;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of a bodhisattva, because of the pacification of sentient beings; practice the sympathy of a Tathāgata, because of attainment of the characteristic of “thusness”;</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of a buddha, because of the enlightenment of sentient beings; practice the sympathy of the naturally [accomplished sage], because of the imperceptibility of causes; </p><p class="P1">Greed, anger and ignorance are not piled up anywhere for an arhat, and this brings forth their deep compassion. Just being near someone in this state of mind quiets our mind; going near a bodhisattva, for example. The Tathagata or one who has lost all of those caught places is, as Hakuin Zenji has written it, one who is “realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be anyplace else. Realizing the thought of no thought as thought, singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.” Or, as it was said, “You have come with no coming and you leave with no leaving,” naturally coming, naturally going. </p><p class="P1">Master Ryokan has said,</p><p class="P5">The flower blooms empty-mindedly,  </p><p class="P5">And the butterfly comes to the flower empty-mindedly.</p><p class="P1">When the flower blooms, the butterfly comes; the butterfly comes when the flower is blooming. Neither has planned this. In a natural way it works like this with no expectation on either’s part–simply things exactly as they are. This is how the Tathagata is and compassion is, not producing something special or something particular. </p><p class="P1">For visiting someone who is sick, to visit them in a natural way, not making any big deal about it but going to visit, entering naturally, speaking to them, enjoying being together with them for that moment, and leaving in a regular way. To not give unnecessary words to someone who is sick, but just to enjoy seeing them and being together. To forget the sickness for a short time, this is true compassion. To not plan and push, yet to open someone’s mind with even a few right words, this is the Way of the Tathagata–nothing special, but to forget being sick even for a moment. This is compassion.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of bodhi, because of the sameness of the single taste;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of inequivalence, because of the eradication of the affections;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of great compassion, because of guiding [sentient beings] by means of the Mahayana;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonrevulsion, because of the contemplation of emptiness and no-self;</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti continues. The Buddha’s compassion comes naturally because from the origin what we all are is compassionate, naturally wanting to give something. This is the truest compassion. It’s not about having some special idea or intention involved with that giving. This is something anybody would understand when it is manifested in its truest way; it’s not some special kind of manifestation or something which we have a personal opinion about, but something anyone could easily and openly be and receive. This true compassion is something we all have. It resembles wanting to give something from an egoistic expectation and intention, and maybe this is not a bad thing, but to spontaneously give without any agenda is the natural compassion. They look similar but they are not the same; it is about whether the ego is involved or not involved. The word “compassion” is one kanji, but as used here it has two parts. One part of the ideograph of “compassion” means “to take away pain” and the other half means “to give wisdom.” Both are parts of true great compassion.</p><p class="P1">This great compassion is like the Mahayana–a huge cart that carries everyone. This is how the Mahayana teaching is described: a huge cart on which everyone can ride. We can really entrust to the Mahayana. As for the mind of great compassion, we can have deep trust in it as well.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of nonrevulsion, because of the contemplation of emptiness and no-self;</p><p class="P1">When love is new, people make great efforts to continue. But as people get used to it, they get bored. It loses its freshness. In true great compassion there is never anything like that. It is fresh, it is never exhausted, it is not something special. Because it is from essence we can know this total letting go to it. This is the way of great compassion.</p><p class="P2">Six paramitas</p><p class="P1">Next, the six paramitas are given as ways of great compassion.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the charity of Dharma, because of the absence of regrets;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of morality, because of converting the transgressors; practice the sympathy of forbearance, because of protecting others and self;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of exertion, because of carrying the burden for sentient beings;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of concentration, because of not experiencing the flavors [of desire];“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of wisdom, because of the absence of any time of non-understanding;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of skillful means, because of the manifestation of all [teaching methods];</p><p class="P1">The ways of great compassion are usually spoken of as charity in things, but here it is saying that it is a giving not of things but of Dharma. Without any resentment it also aligns us with the way of being with the ten severe precepts: to not kill life, to not steal, to not tell untruths, to not be unclear in relationships, to not be intoxicated. No matter what happens, to not be moved around by anything but to drink it all down, because this is also compassion. And that requires us to work on purifying and clarifying our mind.</p><p class="P1">The way of tolerance–to smile no matter what comes along–this is compassion. To do twice as much as others in making efforts so people can see what that looks like. And to not be confused and upset by what we see and hear–this is samadhi. In doing things there is a timing, and without that direct application of compassion it is hard to become one and melt together with another. We also have to be serene, or we can’t know what another person really needs at any given moment. Yet this compassion is still not something special, says Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P4">“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of non-hiding, because of the purity of sincerity;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the profound mind, because of the absence of heterogeneous practices;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of the non-crazed, because of not using false conventions;“‘[I should] practice the sympathy of peace and joy, because of causing [beings] to attain the joy of buddhahood—thus is the sympathy of the bodhisattva.’”</p><p class="P1">Next Vimalakirti talks about the liberative technique. For this we need the particular wisdom of any given moment. Putting in fresh flowers, massaging someone’s feet, not only doing what the person says they want us to, but to intuit exactly what they need the most, and with no secrets or being bothered by anything that happens there. This is truly compassion. It is not about something which is only being given in the name of the Buddha, but which is intuitively possible to be seen as what that person needs in any moment and situation. It takes serenity to see what this is.</p><p class="P1">If someone is sick for a long time their mind can become heavy and also scattered. To not meet them with that same state of mind, but using clarity to be secure and steady and support their life energy. To support their deepest security, not in the usual sense of worldly security but as the deep trust in the Buddha’s words and ways. And in each word the Mind’s profound depth is manifested. This deep inner security is what is great compassion, that compassion of no limits, infinite, without any boundaries at all. This is what is important.</p><p class="P1">Finally the Four Immeasurable Treasures are brought in here as ways of great compassion. These were discussed in the Buddha land building section of this sutra. This is when one realizes compassion and it gets passed along, widening exponentially, infinitely.</p><p class="P4">3. Mañjuśrī asked further, “What is compassion?”</p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti answered, “The merits achieved by the bodhisattva are entirely shared with all sentient beings.”</p><p class="P1">As you heard before, the word for compassion has two parts. The first is to liberate the person from pain and the second is to therein bring joy and wisdom. Taking away the pain, the mind can then become quiet and joy and wisdom become possible. Then that quiet mind can be used to spread that quiet to everyone else it encounters, exponentially.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī: “What is joy?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “If there is benefit, then one rejoices without regret.” </p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī: “What is forsaking?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The blessings generated are without expectation.” </p><p class="P1">It can be very lonely and scary to be sick. We can hear things and feel emotions that are not familiar and are not relevant to our surroundings and our sense of our situation. To become one with the other to take away their pain, having someone by your side when you’ve a bad dream, someone who can wake you up and say, “Hey! That’s a bad dream!” In doing this we can then feel what is benefiting both self and other, right there. To take away any kind of fear and pain. Finally they’re able to throw away everything to realize the Four Immeasurable Treasures themselves. And that is done with an infinite expansion of mind.</p><p class="P1">That sickness which Vimalakirti has been teaching about from the outset is only phenomena. We have to compassionately tell a person just that, awaken them to that. And from the understanding of that, great love is brought forth. This is endless and eternal compassion. To awaken to that is the wisdom of the Buddha. To realize that this is what true compassion is, is what Vimalakirti is teaching.</p><p class="P4">4. Mañjuśrī asked, “For the bodhisattva who fears samsara, what should be his reliance?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “A bodhisattva who fears samsara should rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit.” </p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti is telling us not to be deceived by others’ pain, not to be deceived by the phenomena of sickness or we will lose our true wisdom. In our truest root there is no sickness; from the origin there is no form, there is no shape. This is why it is named “Buddha nature” for want of a better terminology. Vimalakirti continues, saying that compassion is not something that arises relative to another’s suffering; it is something that is there from the origin. Compassion is huge and equal for each and every person and circumstance.</p><p class="P1">When we are like this it immediately becomes clear of itself. To recognize this beyond fear of it, though, this is what is satori. And Manjusri then asks what to do to help those to see this, and the answer is that right in the middle of the fuss of society he should stand to see where the mind should take refuge.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit—in what should he abide?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit should abide in saving all sentient beings.”</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P1">Things are always in flux in every instant, so in what should we take our refuge? It used to be that individuals had small businesses, but now it is big businesses which use a small company here and there as a small part of a larger process, a larger whole. Often these smaller businesses don’t even know what the whole process is and what part of a whole they actually are. These ways of developing things put people into very uncomfortable situations. Today we have this problem across the board in many different areas–looking at health insurance, for example. In a world like this, people are losing jobs and employment everywhere and expressing their insecurity with violence and bombings, in the contagious way uprisings spread. Weak people commit suicide. People don’t know what to do, where to turn. This kind of dis-ease has become common. People are clueless about how they can possibly repair it, and where to go from here.</p><p class="P1">So where can refuge be found?</p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattva who wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata’s merit should abide in saving all sentient beings.”</p><p class="P1">This is what Vimalakirti says: Bodhisattvas are those who have resolved their desires, and even if society does provide, they rely on their own inner resources. This world is a borrowed reality. This is what the bodhisattvas know. And if we don’t see it that way we will stay confused. There are many who hold to a god or a buddha as being responsible or offering a solution. But many found out that this is no reality that we can depend upon. Where can we find this reality in our mind? </p><p class="P4">5. Mañjuśrī asked, “If one wishes to save sentient beings, what should be eradicated?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “If one wishes to save sentient beings, the afflictions should be eradicated.” </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P1"> What variety of mind should be upheld, Manjusri is asking. Vimalakirti is saying that we must not be deceived and not be hanging on and not be indulgent in our investigation of what we should be realizing for liberating all beings, but rather, we have to stand firmly on the vow and the deep commitment to do that liberating. It has to be done in a way where our confusing small self, our old self, is thrown away completely and we dive right into the Buddha. If we hold onto a small self in any way and want to save ourselves first, this won’t work. We have to throw ourself away completely. If we hold onto our ego–our “I,” “me,” “mine”–we will carry around a dualistic view even into our zazen and will always be in a feverish state of mind, and we will not know how we can go forward. It will be as if we had poked a mad bees’ nest. We don’t sit to carry on our noisy inner confusion of mind, we sit to throw all of that away completely. The Buddha then appears, and this mind which is in what the Buddha appears, that becomes our body. We sit as if it is the Buddha sitting. This kind of zazen is our central fulcrum. If we carry our small self into this we will without fail hit a wall. To throw ourself away completely, that is unconditional; it has to be done totally. We use susokkan as the tool to throw ourself away.</p><p class="P1">This is not about trying to become a something. It is about letting go of everything. We will then naturally realize this place where we can see and know the truth deeply. And this is not about sitting for ourself; this has to be seen clearly or zazen also becomes something which deceives us. We have to throw away our old version of small self. Dive into our zazen and vow to give up everything for the liberating of others—giving everything to our zazen! For people who chant the Buddha’s name it is the chanting which calls out to waken the deepest vow and true commitment.</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti is saying this: “Become the Buddha! Throw your small self away completely! Become that truth of Buddha’s deep faith and trust and decision and commitment to awakening everyone no matter what, going beyond your old small self’s narrow conditioning!” This brings forth great motivation, and we change in a way that enables us to know how to do this liberation. And in the knowing of that our mind settles. </p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “If one wishes to eradicate the afflictions, what should one practice?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “One should practice correct mindfulness.” </p><p class="P1">So Manjusri, being told to dive into becoming a Buddha, asks, how do we do that? Is it really so easy to throw ourselves away? And to this Vimalakirti answers that he should liberate beings from their passions. We can’t hold on to wanting to go out and play, wear nice clothes, do what we feel like. We have to let go of all of our attachments to those things.</p><p class="P1">Being told this, Manjusri continues, how should one who wishes to eliminate passions apply themselves? And Vimalakirti replies that they should apply themselves appropriately. It’s not easy to throw away all those desires. “I want this.” “I want to do that.” “I want it to go like this.” It’s not so easy to throw all of that away. How can that be done? If we want to settle our insecure mind like that we will fall over under the weight of such a heavy vow and commitment. But Vimalakirti has answered, apply yourself appropriately. “Appropriately” means having continuous, clear, correct mind moments. This “correct” is not a relative correct. This “correct,” which is also the word “<span class="T1">mu</span>,” is not “correct” relative to “mistaken.” It is “correct” as in “one straight line.” If we don’t decide and become that one straight line, we get pushed over by our impurities within, endlessly. Those thoughts, all helter-skelter, do not settle. But we have to decide to transform those helter-skelter mind moments in one fell swoop, a decided moment, in one straight line. And doing that, letting go of all thinking that we even have let go of all of our thinking–that is when it becomes truly one straight line. It becomes ongoing clear mind moments then.</p><p class="P1">To become this one straight line of life energy we have to become completely that life energy–this state of mind of while having desires to not be moved around by them. Shoju Rojin, whose name was also Dokyo Etan Zenji, was the master of Master Hakuin. Hakuin teaches that we should always continue in clear mind moments. But his teacher also said that almost no one could do it. Dokyo Etan Zenji said, “I am almost 70 years old and it has taken me 40 years!</p><p class="P4">”Mañjuśrī asked, “How does one practice correct mindfulness?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “One should practice nongeneration and nonextinction.”</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P1">There are different ways of doing this. In the Jodo Sect there is the practice of chanting the Buddha’s name. In Christianity we have praying without ceasing. For all of these it is about not piling up unnecessary thinking in our mind, but rather to be present in this very moment completely. To not have any unnecessary decoration—it’s that with which we crush ourselves. In this cold weather, to have just enough clothing, just enough food, to return to our true life energy and mind.</p><p class="P1">In Zen we become the decision to liberate all beings no matter what. In this way, whether in our job or whether  in our home life, it is a matter of becoming that job and that home life totally and completely. Whatever it is we are doing, whether it’s sitting in the zendo, eating, doing samu, we don’t invite in any extra thinking. It has to be in this way where everything else is put aside and we aren’t having any extraneous thoughts.</p><p class="P1">The same way is true for a singer. When a top rate singer is singing she’s not letting in a lot of extra thoughts about what she’s doing and how it’s going or other things in her life. Or a first rate athlete who has to let go of all of that thinking while playing his sport—eventually he’s not even thinking that he’s not letting in that thinking, he’s only becoming that ball. The athlete becomes that ball completely; without it being like that he cannot play well. This is true for all of us in everything we do. This is the world of becoming oneness completely.</p><p class="P2">Bankei Zenji </p><p class="P1">Bankei Zenji lived 300 years ago. He was the one we’ve been hearing about who was always teaching about the Unborn Mind. He wrote a poem:</p><p class="P5">The old barrel, <br/>The bottom falls out.  </p><p class="P5">In all the three worlds there is nothing left,  </p><p class="P5">Not even one band of iron.</p><p class="P1">People don’t use such wooden barrels so much anymore. They used to use them for storing wine, for example, or for storing other things. If we saw them we could see that they would be tied at the top with a paper string or a metal string so the thing inside them wouldn’t spoil.</p><p class="P1">When a barrel got old and leaked, new barrels would be made when necessary. But often you could see old, unused, finished barrels left here and there, gathering rain, dead leaves, small animal poop. And all of that together would eventually start bubbling and create methane gas, just like our mind and our stored-up thinking does. All that grumbling, all that dissatisfaction, that methane gas bubbling. We all gather stuff like that. And if we keep it bottled up, then we come to a place where it bursts out. We have to keep our practice going in such a way that we let go of that and continue with these ongoing clear mind moments. As we continue that in one straight line we come to a moment when the bottom of the barrel bursts out completely and the stave boards, the sides of the barrel, fall out and the barrel’s rings are all that is left. This bottom that falls out is like our ego. That ego makes everything difficult. Drop that ego like the bottom falling out of the barrel! Then we can know how our true state of mind actually is. But we have to sit completely and totally becoming it to do this. We can be sitting with the chanting of the Buddha’s name until we lose track of the zendo, the heavens and earth, and then all of our insecurities will be gone. This is the fulcrum of the liberation of all beings. There is no trick. It is only that it has to be done until that bottom falls out completely, and that is possible with the ki energy and the continuous mind moments that go with doing it in one straight line. This is how we realize its deep truth.</p><p class="P1">We are not all such high quality people of training here perhaps, but we have to continue until that bottom falls out completely. Nevertheless, whether we can do it or not we have to continue because this is what we know we have to do. We may want to have it go quickly but it may take a longer time. We can’t suddenly decide we want to give up, we just have to continue. We have to continue and do it to whatever degree we possibly can.</p><p class="P1">The bodhisattvas who are still insecure about life and death are asking how should they resolve their insecure mind. Manjusri asks Vimalakirti this question on behalf of all these insecure bodhisattvas. He has already seen these points himself—Manjusri has—but he’s asking on our behalf, for the doubts in our minds, to have Vimalakirti say these answers for everyone. Manjusri Bodhisattva already knows very well, but those bodhisattvas who want to work in society need to know this. We need to know how to not be insecure about life and death, having this dualistic view of birth and death, good and bad, gain and loss, profitable and unprofitable, these wisps of dualism that still are always flickering through our minds because our absolute core is not yet clearly established. We still get pulled around by things and places. How to let go of that is what is being asked about here, and to this Vimalakirti says that a bodhisattva should stand on the inner magnanimity and equanimity of the Buddha in the midst of any and all turbulence.</p><p class="P1">So many times we become confused by many different opinions about things and about people–other people’s judgments about stuff. We have to work with this or finally we can end up losing track of who we should be listening to. Vimalakirti saw this question, and since it is about bodhisattvas asking it, he answered it by talking about that deep, deep vow–the power of the vow, the Dharma body and the Wisdom body.</p><p class="P1">The Wisdom body is Amida Nyorai, who represents all good and all evil beings being liberated, without any exception. The power of this vow to liberate all, both good and bad, is called Amida Nyorai. Not with all of these thoughts swinging us around, but by calling forth the great vow power within can we do this. Not scattering it, but gathering it: this cannot be done with concepts because our mind and inner awareness only become diluted and superficial with concepts. That is what makes us insecure. As Bodhidharma said, to let go of all connections to anything whatsoever that is external, and within, to let go of any concerns. When we can be like that, we are like a firm, tall, wall and at one with the Way. To not be pulled around by what is external at all, or by whether we can do it or can’t do it, or by those myriad thoughts that are always being born. Instead, to bring our mind into focus, gather our strong vow power into oneness, and then it becomes strong ki energy.</p><p class="P1">As the roshi often says when he is teaching zazen, the breathing is like blowing up a balloon and not giving any attention to anything else external. To exhale completely in each breath to the very, very end of our exhalation, not by forcing, not by pushing too hard. It’s not about trying to force something to happen, but in the natural way, to see clearly, to look at it carefully. And being relaxed in the top half of our body we are then centered in the lower part of our body. With our focus in our abdomen we exhale completely, then we inhale naturally. Without allowing any gaps between the inhalation and exhalation and the next inhalation and exhalation, we continue and always exhale to the very end of the breath. We do this continually and we become full and taut with energy. To the very tips of our hair pores we can feel this energy. This full tautness is what more and more will relieve our difficult places, and we become full of motivated energy.</p><p class="P1">But you really have to do this like a fool, to just do it and nothing else. Doing this with no gaps, then we can find that deep inner energy within that brings it forth. Our motivation continues, and strong ki energy is building. This is how it has to be done; Vimalakirti is teaching the bodhisattvas what they have to do, telling them to bring forth Nyorai’s great vow power from within, that this is the fulcrum of how to resolve their insecurity.</p><p class="P1">Thoughts still come but we put aside our own good fortune and focus, for all people’s liberation, on letting go of all those attached desires. More and more we let go and we see that the thinking is only a habit. So we replace that habit with a new habit of thinking of nothing at all, only focusing on right now, right here, right in front of our face—only on this place of right here and this time of right now. Our energy becomes strong and clear, and then we are able to, in anything we encounter, become it. If it’s our zazen we become totally that zazen. If it’s our working, we become totally, completely at one with our working. If it’s eating, we become totally that eating. And doing this we become huge and we become a settled state of mind. It is nothing to become confused about, really. Only to focus within.</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti is talking about the samadhi of going in one straight line. People who are chanting the Buddha’s name, Namu Amida Butsu, do that for their whole lifetime. They will continue that as their way to enter samadhi in one straight line. Or Namu Myo Renge Kyo, chanting that always, and keeping that what is foremost in their focus. In the way of Zen, people do zazen. But if we only do it as a form and not in essence, if we only do it in the zendo and not all the time, then when we leave the zendo it is no longer true samadhi. We have to be able to have continuous clear mind moments, to have this twenty-four hours a day in fact, not just twenty minutes a day of zazen here. Then we realize that functioning is the manifesting of that one straight line, and that is how we can keep it going all day long. That is zazen in action.</p><p class="P1">If we are always clear in mind, our mind is not moved around, whether it’s here or there or we’re in this situation or that situation. We must be clear and settled for this, however, and always be in a state of mind that is like freely running water. As the patriarch Manura Sonja said, “The mind is truly mysterious. Its way is miraculously subtle. If you follow its flow and can perceive its nature, you’ll be stuck on neither joy nor sorrow.” While the mind continually sees and hears, it holds on to nothing at all.</p><p class="P1">We are so often deceived by what is external and mistakenly get pulled off our inner center. With that we will not know the true and accurate perception of pain or sorrow or joy and truth. We won’t be able to know why we are doing zazen. To not have our mind pulled around by what is outside of us. Instead, be like a mirror that holds onto nothing that comes into it whatsoever. It only reflects exactly what’s coming: That is the straightforward mind that was written about earlier. But for this we have to have a truthful and clear mind.</p><p class="P1">The state of mind when people are just beginning to sit and that state of mind of those who have sat for a long time are naturally quite different. At the beginning our mind resists and roams, but as we continue we see that the pain is a matter of course, and we know that it won’t be damaging; this comes from our experience of it. Our breath at the very beginning is very hard to find and feel clearly and decisively, but as we sit it becomes clear and regular. Training our mind is like training a dog in this: a little wild in the beginning, it gradually becomes obedient. It stops poking around in every garbage can that it encounters. It starts following its owner around more easily. And there doesn’t need to be some kind of leash around its neck all the time; it’s no longer concerned about unnecessary things. But we have to sit to this point. In the beginning no one can do it immediately, even if they pretend to. But bit by bit we continue, and then it all settles.</p><p class="P1">Our zazen becomes the state of mind that is not stopped and is not stopping thinking, either. This is a frequent misunderstanding. It’s about not being caught on any thoughts. It is not like being a tightrope walker who only concentrates and balances when they are on a high rope. Our zazen has to be able to kick in all the time. It’s not that thoughts are bad; it’s only that we continually follow them around like a broken tape loop. So instead we say, OK, I’m not going to think at all. This is like when the electricity goes off suddenly; that has no purpose, either. Rather, as Master Rinzai says, when we perceive something directly, to not add on any thoughts to that perception; no associations and no second ideas. </p><p class="P1">To only directly perceive without second or third thoughts added. This will have more value for our practice than thirteen years of pilgrimage. This awareness is a flowing dynamic. If it does not flow it gets stagnant, and then it is truly like a broken tape recorder, and our mind just repeats and repeats the same thing over and over again. It cannot be like that. Our zazen must be fluid and useful in every part of our life. It’s not a separate life of zazen only on the cushion. We have to experience the true state of mind to be able to be without thoughts that we don’t need. If we have a goal or a need for thinking, then there is no problem with using thoughts. But when we are using them, to use them directly, with our direct perceptions, in our intuitive way, with our intuitive perceptions. Doing this is very simple: “This is a flower.” “A bird is singing.” “Rain is falling;” adding on nothing else. To cultivate this direct perception is zazen. It’s not about trying to stop thoughts. To cultivate this direct perception is a healthy state of mind.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.” </p><p class="P1">Our awareness cannot be described by any word because it has no form. As Master Rinzai has said, our true mind has no form, yet it extends in all ten directions. Throughout the universe, it permeates everywhere. Hearing this we think there is something special permeating; it is very far from this. It is not that there is something special. It is our directly perceiving mind: a flower, a mountain, a river–all the 100,000 things. Through the five windows of our senses we perceive these. Our awareness flows in and out. There are no words that can be used to explain our awareness. If in our mind we have ideas, we cannot make use of our abilities and capabilities because, stuck on an idea about them, they cannot flow. Not to be stuck on an idea of something special or a particular idea of how things should work. Without those stuck ideas we can extend freely in all ten directions and respond always in the appropriate way.</p><p class="P1">The base of our awareness is to not hold onto anything at all because nothing at all is truly how it is. We see the mountains and the mountains are in our awareness. This is our healthy awareness. But our weak place is that our mirror reflects unnecessary things. Without that, we perceive directly and clearly. As the roshi always says to his students, after osesshin, to stay in nature for a few days and not get scattered. Perceive clearly the nature of clear mind while it is clarified awareness after osesshin, and not to go scattering our attention and focus externally. </p><p class="P1">The actual important time of osesshin is in fact right after the osesshin when we experience how truthful our perception is. We also can’t be caught on that, though, or on our experiences. The things that we have experienced become preconceived notions. To not hold on to past experiences, especially in human relationships. To look at this carefully and align our way of being and mind. We all have this true base of mind from the origin; we all have received this. There is nothing more wonderful than this truth.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”</p><p class="P1">The Sixth Patriarch has addressed this same question by saying that anything that is externally perceived, to not add on thoughts of good and bad to it, and anything that is within, to not be caught by it. To this very point the Sixth Patriarch has said it so kindly. That mirror—that mirror in which there is nothing at all, yet that activity of mind is functioning—that is what he is speaking of. While there’s nothing in that mirror at all, this activity of mind extends throughout the universe. This is without any birth or death, open, totally open, completely open. This is the true mind moment. To return to that!</p><p class="P1">And to this Manjusri adds–purposely dividing them–What is not produced? What is not destroyed? Vimalakirti answers that evil is not produced and good is not destroyed. This means to not deceive our true mind. Because we don’t trust our own direct perception, we start inventing other thoughts and dualistic perception. To not do that. To not do that inventing is good. To hold on to what we invent—that is not our direct, true perception. That is what is referred to as evil. But because what comes forth of its own has no birth or death, it is not actual. And neither is that which we produce; that is not actual either. Neither of those are actual, and therefore our true nature remains as being nothing at all.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of good and bad dharmas?” Vimalakīrti: “The body is their fundamental basis.” </p><p class="P1">In fact, good and bad are nothing in actuality. They are only produced phenomena. This is why next, Manjusri asks what is the root of good and evil, and Vimalakirti answers, “Materiality is the root of good and evil.” Because we have a body—that is what materiality means here—that is to say, because we are alive, we divide into good and evil. With just a physical body there is no seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling. But here, “body” means because we are alive. So because there is a body, because we are alive, there is good and bad.</p><p class="P1">Manjusri continues questioning Vimalakirti to the very last, ultimate point; he doesn’t stop.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of the body?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “Desire is its fundamental basis.” </p><p class="P1">So what is the source of that body? “Desire is the root of materiality.” To exist is to have those three activities: greed, anger, and ignorance. Blood circulates through our physical body, carrying oxygen and nutrition to our trillions of cells and making possible the strong, energetic activity of our body.  If we are missing something we will naturally get a sign from our body: “Need air.” “Need water.” “Need food.” In our body these are instinctual needs. (These are usually divided into the titles, Greed, Anger and Ignorance, but here it is only written as desire.) Because of these we have our basic greediness. But these are not bad things; they are for staying alive. From these desires our thoughts arise and are born because we get insecure because of what we need. Then we start wanting more than we need, and the instinctual desires become more than we need; the instinctual desires become greedy desires. This is how we all work, and if we aren’t aware of it we’ll be moving around blindly. We are all confused constantly by our extreme desires beyond necessity. To see this clearly we have to do correct zazen or our confusion will be ever greater. In this way Vimalakirti is meticulously teaching us.</p><p class="P1">The essential part of this section of the Vimalakirti Sutra is now being looked at.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “How does one practice correct mindfulness?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “One should practice nongeneration and nonextinction.” </p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.”</p><p class="P1">To relieve anxiety, continuous, clear mind moments are most important. The Sixth Patriarch puts it that the most central marrow of the lineage is to be without any mind moments being polluted, without any form in our mind, no sense of a small self, and to always be flowing like clear water, never located and fixed in a stagnant way in any certain place. The Buddha realized the truth which has always existed as an inner truth and outer truth, the outer truth being the sciences and laws that are true for any culture at any time, such as one plus one equals two or that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen; these outer laws are true anywhere and clearly are unchanging. The inner laws are those such as Master Rinzai has said: “The Dharma has no form yet it extends in all ten directions.” No human is exempt from these inner laws either.</p><p class="P1">Ananda, the disciple of the Buddha, asked the Buddha what the disciples should do when the Buddha died, and the Buddha said, “Be a lamp unto yourselves. Look to and take refuge in the Dharma. Do not look externally and do not look to others.” The Buddha used many means and taught the actuality of the mind his whole life. “Take refuge in the Dharma,” he said. To take refuge within, not to look for light externally and not to look for the light in others.</p><p class="P1">Though even twins have different personalities and all people have different appearances and different characters, they are actually nevertheless all of that same mind that has no form. That mind has no form. While the ego has many opinions and ideas and stances which are as different as human beings’ characters, there is also a mind which precedes this individualized ego. And this mind is something that is the same in all beings and is the source of all; this is what the Buddha called Dharma. It is only one. Our mental activity changes according to the person, but the source is the same for each and every person.</p><p class="P1">The Sixth Patriarch was the sixth ancient in the line which was started with Bodhidharma. The Buddha’s teaching is given here throughout the passing on of the transmission from ancient to ancient. All of them were awakened to the one and same truth. Kasho, Ananda, throughout the patriarchs —in this mind not a single thought is needed. Not a single thought is held onto. This is the truth. If we think of something, ego arises, but if we are not thinking about anything, not even a mind moment arises. This is where we all are exactly the same.</p><p class="P1">The mind’s true base is without any form. For mind to be stopped nowhere, for us to be not located but flowing in mind, is our healthiest way of being. This actuality is what Vimalakirti is using in what he is teaching here. To think of nothing at all is our true mind, or else we are all separated. Before that, prior to that, it is one true mind. True mind is empty-mindedness. If we only think about it then we can’t see it clearly.</p><p class="P1">But empty-mindedness is not to think about thinking of nothing at all. It is to not think about unnecessary things. We think so many unnecessary things we no longer can tell the difference; we can’t see what we need to think and what we don’t need to think. It is healthy when we are only having thoughts arise when they are needed. But if during zazen, for example, we are always concerned with things that happened in the past and things that might happen in the future, it makes us scattered. This is not clarity of mind.</p><p class="P1">We meet people and then seeing their face we may suddenly think of the past when we’d known them or had some experience with them. And we have many memories. This is common and this can become difficult, especially, for example, if it’s with family and relatives. If we are not reserved and clear in our state of mind it can become very, very difficult. We easily have a habit of just making up and thinking lots of indulgent thoughts. But it is very important to see that necessary thinking, when it’s no longer needed, is gone. This is what clear mind is like.</p><p class="P1">To have only the thoughts we need. When we are working, for example, the data, the other information we need, we use. We use it easily and without being attached to it it goes very simply. Beginners, of course, when they’re learning to do something need lots of information to do the job, but that is just one step where they need all that information. It is not always going to be needed to be held onto to do the job. So we can speak without being caught on the fact that we are even speaking. We can think without being caught on the fact that we are thinking. The problem is that we have so many thoughts we don’t need, and we don’t align that. As the Sixth Patriarch said, our living truth is to be caught on no thought. Having them but to not be attached to them.</p><p class="P1">Second in our lineage’s truth is this mind of no small self: There is no mind of form. We are not needing to always be thinking in terms of an “I” or a “me.” From morning we wash our clothes, we clean, we cook, but our most effective work is done when we are not hanging onto thoughts about a “myself.” We clean but we don’t keep thinking about cleaning when we finish our cleaning. Problems arise when we are thinking about things when we have already finished them. We have to let go of our old, conditioned thinking, to always be in a new and regenerating state of mind. This is our newly aligned mind, this place of no mind moments to be polluted, no caught form or small “I,” a mind which is always flowing like clear water, never fixed at a location or stagnant. And these are what Vimalakirti is talking about here and making clear.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.” </p><p class="P1">As the Heart Sutra teaches, we must go beyond mental understanding. If we limit training to be only mental understanding, it has no effect on our actual life. Just as we can’t do sports or play violin by knowing and thinking about how things are done, instead we have to practice and  experience. We learn by experiencing and doing. If we are just thinking about doing things then we ‘relate’ only to thoughts and we don’t develop. We have to forget our body, our thoughts, forget ourself completely, and not get caught on our fixed awareness of being a body. Then we can directly perceive this reality.</p><p class="P1">When we forget our body, then we can actually walk the experience of realizing our true original nature directly. That is why this osesshin participation is so important: to touch one’s own true Mind directly. You cannot imagine how essential this is. Even for people like those here who are usually working in society, to be able to come here and throw ourselves away and be absorbed into true clear Mind–this is so important! Deeper prajna wisdom only works, only comes forth from deep experience. Even if not able to do this all at once, we dig in and we continue until we can realize that experience of the deepest true Mind directly!</p><p class="P1">We have a body and it is our instinct to protect it. We have to let go of all of that; if we can realize that we will not need to be taught. We will know ourselves, from what we have realized, exactly what we have to do. That is why this experience and the Buddha’s teaching from what he learned when he was on Dantokusan Mountain is so important–so we can also clarify this and realize our deepest mind directly. Until the Buddha, no one who had experienced this had in the same way so openly shared it. Even the Buddha had thought that no one would possibly believe him. But he creatively worked on it from every angle and then for his whole entire life, he taught.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What dharmas are nongenerated and what dharmas are nonextinguished?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “The not-good are to be nongenerated, and the good dharmas are to be nonextinguished.” </p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of good and bad dharmas?” Vimalakīrti: “The body is their fundamental basis.” </p><p class="P1">It says in the Heart Sutra, there is no birth, no death, no increase, no decrease, no purity and nothing impure. This is not meaning that behind this emptiness is a something that is a bad something or a good something, only that relative to realizing the true nature, something can be looked at as good or bad. This something is not the realizing of the true nature, something which is only a reflection. We hear a birdsong and it is simply and directly perceived. But if we add a naming and we add an opinion, it is no longer direct and there is extra added thinking to it; that is not the point when it comes to realizing our true nature directly.</p><p class="P1">Awareness and experience are only things that we imagine exist. But the clear mind is right there in them all the time and they all act together. That which arises from thinking is not actual, so anything that is thought of as good or bad is not of our true original Mind. If we see sickness as well, that is not the actuality of our true nature, and we should not be caught on it. Only our eyes, just as they see, our ears, just as they hear. And what is the source of that? The source of that is that we have a body and there are five senses there. This is what he is talking about when he says “The body is their fundamental basis.”</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of the body?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “Desire is its fundamental basis.” </p><p class="P1">Because there is desire and it gets extreme, everyone has greed, anger and ignorance. But these instincts themselves before they become extreme are not something bad; we need them for our body to live. But our body is something that dies; we only need these instincts for when our body is alive. If these instincts become extreme, that is when they become greed, anger and ignorance.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of desire?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “False discrimination is its fundamental basis.”</p><p class="P4">6. Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of false discrimination?” Vimalakīrti: “Confused conception is its fundamental basis.”</p><p class="P1">The blinding instincts which arise only of their own, these unreal constructions–these are the roots of desire. As Master Dogen Zenji said, all humans are born as animal instincts only, and have to be trained or we will always be continuously moved around by our desires. What is their source? Their source is that ongoing, untethered, central-placed “I.” Here Vimalakirti says, “Unreal construction is the root of desire,” to which Manjusri then presses, “What is the root of unreal construction?” We see everything as if it is centered around “me,” “my.”</p><p class="P1">There are billions of human beings on this globe, and if each and every one of them only thinks of themselves we will be crushed immediately and the world and its ecology will be destroyed. Because we are all seeing from an unreal construction we see from a view where we are always–always–thinking of our own greatest personal benefit, making our personal benefit what is most important. That brings the four upside down views.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of false discrimination?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “Confused conception is its fundamental basis.”</p><p class="P1">This baselessness is the main point here. As the Sixth Patriarch has said, our sect’s most central point is that we have no mind moments to be polluted; that there is no “I,” no form in our mind and that we are always flowing like clear water. This mind is not stagnant or fixed in location but rather, as Master Hakuin has said in his Song of Zazen, “All sentient beings are essentially Buddhas. Like water and ice, there is no ice without water; apart from sentient beings there are no buddhas.” In this way our universe is said to be made of molecules and atoms which are always expressing through changes in their form. This is like that water. But if we get caught on being our small self version with its narrow view, it all becomes like ice and does not flow. If it flows there is no such thing as a “good” and “bad” because it’s always transforming from one to the other naturally as it flows, and it is not fixed into an egoistic view such as “This is good” and “This is bad.” Flowing mind cannot hold an ego view because it is always flowing and changing. That is why it is always new and fresh and new and fresh and new and fresh; that is our true nature.</p><p class="P1">While it is our true nature and we know that, in our life it is not so simple to be that way. We can’t so simply say, “There’s no good and bad.” We see where someone is spreading pain and suffering everywhere. People don’t always do good things or always do bad things, and someone who does bad things may also be a great parent. We can’t label this. But if there is no flow it is bad and becomes more and more bad as the toxins build up. Neither can we be caught on “This is beautiful” and “That is good and pretty,” nor is that which is bad and hard to look at something we should be caught on. We have to look carefully at this and see how it is all really working. Even if we are able to attain something we love very much, that can also make us caught on something. Not to be caught on what is good and not to be caught on what is evil: This is what Vimalakirti is finally saying.</p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of confused conception?” Vimalakīrti: “The nonabiding is its fundamental basis.” </p><p class="P4">Mañjuśrī asked, “What is the fundamental basis of nonabiding?” </p><p class="P4">Vimalakīrti: “Nonabiding is without any fundamental basis. All dharmas are established on the fundamental basis of nonabiding.”</p><p class="P1">All things, whether sickness or crisis or not, never stay forever because all of it is phenomena. Do what we have to do right now! That is how it has to be. To not say, “Oh, I’ll get to it later!” “Oh, I’ll get to it next time.” We lose that opportunity which is right now because it is phenomena, and phenomena all change. We know all things, all suffering, all good things all bad things, all change so we have to do it now when we have this opportunity. We all live in this flux of space and time. We cannot return to a particular moment. We don’t want to live in regrets, and that is why we have to hold each moment’s opportunity precious and see through every single last bit of phenomena. This is Buddhism’s most important place.</p><p class="P1">At the end of this exchange between  Manjusri and Vimalakirti, a Goddess appeared:  </p><p class="P4">7. At the time, there was a goddess in Vimalakīrti’s room who, upon seeing the great men listening to the Dharma being explained, made herself visible and scattered heavenly flowers over the bodhisattvas and great disciples. When the flowers reached the bodhisattvas they all immediately fell off, but when they reached the great disciples they adhered and did not fall off. Even using all their numinous powers, the disciples were unable to remove the flowers. </p><p class="P4">8. At that time, the goddess asked Śāriputra, “Why would you remove the flowers?”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra answered, “These flowers are contrary to the Dharma, so I would remove them.” </p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Do not say that these flowers are contrary to the Dharma! Why? These flowers are without discrimination. Sir, it is you who are generating discriminative thoughts. If one who has left home in the Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is contrary to the Dharma; if such a one is without discrimination, this is in accord with the Dharma.</p><p class="P1">The women from India, even today, offer flowers, chanting to the Buddha, Buddham Saranam Gacchami.  But in this situation, some of the flowers stuck to the disciples who were ordained; they did not like them and tried to shake them off.  The Goddess asked, why are you so unhappy with having these flowers sent down to you?  To this Sariputra answered, “These are not natural flowers.  This is not appropriate for an ordained person to have flowers pour down on them and have them stick to them.”  But the Goddess said, “That is just your idea of what is appropriate and what is not appropriate.  That is simply dualistic.  This is just your own dualistic view of these flowers, how they should not be sticking to you because you are ordained.  No matter what a good thing, if you are doing it or receiving it with a dualistic state of mind, it is no longer truly a good thing.”  </p><p class="P1">In Buddhism especially, there is reticence about be thanked for doing something because then people get caught on ideas of what is good and what is bad.  And that divides human beings into good people and bad people, and that continues this perception that there is a dualistic thought that is correct.  If we call someone a good person, then we also are also saying that there is a someone who is not good.  People looking at Buddhism can get very confused, and in this way we may be increasing delusion rather than taking it away from them.</p><p class="P1">We get praised and we eagerly want to carry that around with us and think about it.  Or we get put down and criticized and we can’t let go of the bad feeling—how it made us think that we’re someone terrible.  We carry these thoughts around—thinking we are great because we are praised or terrible because we are corrected—and that becomes a very twisted state of mind.  It is this kind of ongoing, dualistic chatter that is being referred to in this exchange between Sariputra and the Goddess.  </p><p class="P1">For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb the fearless.  Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms—sounds, smells, tastes and textures—which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructed world.  If there is, for example, any little thing in our mind, we get very sensitive.  We get bothered.  We get afraid.  If a bamboo leaf even gently brushes against our neck we suddenly think that something is trying to get us and we get freaked out by it.  Or we can even have a heart attack.  We could easily have an accident if we are driving with a mind that is full of fear and afraid of what might happen next.  So perturbed in our state of mind,  we could cause an accident.</p><p class="P4">“Look at the bodhisattvas, to whom the flowers do not adhere—this is because they have eradicated all discriminative thoughts.“For example, when a person is afraid, non-human [beings] are able to control him. Thus, since the disciples fear samsara, then forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles control you. None of the five desires can affect those who have transcended fear.“It is only because the latent influences [of your afflictions] are not yet exhausted that the flowers stick to your bodies.“For those in whom the latent influences are exhausted, the flowers do not stick.”</p><p class="P1">Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instinct for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts.  Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these Bodhisattvas who have abandoned all of their instincts.  </p><p class="P1">In the words of the last sutra of the Buddha, the Yuikyogyo Sutra, the Buddha said, if we don’t let go of all of the obscurations of our perceptions, then we make our originally clear mind, the source of our awareness, opaque and unclear.  But we have a hard time knowing what is what.  </p><p class="P1">Going overboard, we become addicted, even to the extent of having some kind of continuing drug dependency, because we start by thinking, “Well, I will have just a little,” not knowing how much we are deceiving ourselves.  This is why we have to be very attentive to how attached we are to things of the senses.  When we do things too extremely, if we don’t align our perceptions then we easily can lose track of what it is that we are doing, how attached we are to our sense perceptions, and what clutter we bring to them.  We have to see them all from their source.  If we get caught, then it is our ego that comes into the picture.  And that is what is going on in the room of Vimalakirti when the flowers are falling down and getting stuck on the disciples. Actually, that Goddess, she was a Bodhisattva.  </p><p class="P1">The Vimalakirti Sutra is in fact written for teaching people about the path of the Mahayana.  People who are thinking in a small minded dualistic way,  thinking of things for their own benefit, their own satisfaction, or their own liberation—the more we try to get our own personal liberation, if it is only for ourselves and our own small minded satisfaction, then that is a big problem.  If our awakened mind is realized, then we will naturally want to do things for all beings, and our compassion will rise.  We can’t do it without this point being well seen.  </p><p class="P1">The true Bodhisattvas forget themselves completely, even forget that they are a body, and they have no sense of being caught on what is painful or pleasurable and what is desirous because they are not caught on their own personal way of being.  And so the flowers have nobody to even get stuck on.</p><p class="P1">As Master Rinzai says, “When we are perceiving something, to not add even a single notion or association onto what we perceive.  If we practice this diligently then this is worth more than ten years of doing pilgrimage.”  Do not add on any second thoughts or notions to what we perceive, rather to let go of all of those wisps of thoughts that are always coming along with those perceptions.  To whatever we see, we don’t add on any thinking about it.  To whatever we taste, we don’t add on any thinking to it.  To whatever we hear, we don’t add on any thinking to it.  But to just encounter those sense perceptions directly.  To not get moved around by these wisps of thoughts that come in: for this we do zazen.  </p><p class="P1">And then, of course, although we have thoughts that are coming and going, we don’t get moved around by them.  To let go of this is our deepest practice.  To let go of that added on clutter, and those attachments—to not give those our attention; this is Zen.  Letting go of that which wants to gather and stick and clutter.  To not let those things hold us back, but rather to be like the water that goes down stream, meeting big tree trunks and big boulders and not being caught by any of them, just continuing to flow and flow.</p><p class="P1">The disciples felt that it was inappropriate to have these flowers falling and sticking on them, and Sariputra protested.  But the Goddess asked, “Why?  Why are you protesting?” To be caught on such a thing as a flower falling down and sticking onto you?  This is the path of the person who is training only for themselves in the mountains, for their own personal liberation.  This is not the path where one is practicing for all beings in society.  And it is not the way for only a monk but for everyone.  </p><p class="P1">To encounter all those people as  equals: that is what the teaching of the flowers falling was for.  Everyone should be able to encounter the teaching of the Buddha.  It is your misunderstanding to think that having flowers fall down on you because you’re an ordained person is something which is inappropriate.  </p><p class="P1">But in fact this was not your usual Goddess, after all; it was a transformed manifestation of Vimalakirti.  It wouldn’t have been so interesting if Vimalakirti had said all these things.  Much more interesting is to have a Goddess dropping down flowers that get stuck on disciples and not on Bodhisattvas.  The one who is teaching the Way, this is Vimalakirti explaining how all things are equal and how it is important to not be attached to any of them.  Vimalakirti is saying how it is necessary to see this clearly, and that is why he taught it in this way.</p><p class="P1">The Bodhisattvas did not have flowers sticking on them because they lived in the society with the same pain and attachments and struggle as everyone in society.  To be in this world of conflict and difficulty and live there like everyone else, yet be unattached to anything that happens, any difficulty, any struggle within that world!  That is why the flowers don’t stick on the Bodhisattvas.  And the Bodhisattvas would not be bothered if the flowers did stick. </p><p class="P1">In society, things are always changing.   It is possible for anything  to change at any second, and we must live with this changeability without being caught on it.  To be able to be strong and not moved around, no matter what comes along—this is the way of the Bodhisattvas. And it is because they know this state of mind that the flowers did not stick to them.  </p><p class="P4">9. Śāriputra said, “Have you stayed in this room long?”</p><p class="P4">Goddess: “I have stayed in this room as long as you have been emancipated.”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “How long have you stayed here?” The goddess said, “How long has it been since your emancipation?” Śāriputra was silent and did not answer. </p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “What is your great wisdom that you remain silent?” </p><p class="P4">Śāriputra: “Emancipation is not to be spoken of, and so I did not know what to say.” </p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Speech and words are entirely the characteristics of emancipation. Why? “Emancipation is neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Words are also neither internal, nor external, nor intermediate. Therefore, Śāriputra, the explanation of emancipation does not transcend words. Why?</p><p class="P4">“All dharmas have the characteristic of emancipation.”</p><p class="P1"> Sariputra asks the Goddess how long has she been there.  She says it has been as long as the elder, (an elder was considered someone who was sixty and then again who was eighty)  Sariputra, has been liberated. And then she says, “You can’t answer about how long you’ve been liberated, and yet you are calling yourself a top disciple.”  To this, Sariputra said, in liberation, there is no need for words and no time, and so these cannot be expressed.  </p><p class="P1">But the Goddess disagrees with his words.  Why can’t you express it?  If you cannot, it is not the real thing.  And if your mind is truly free there is no being caught on an idea of time and space.  Saying that there is no time, as if you can say that you won’t die if you are liberated.  But you still have to be able to express it.  Even if you are awakened, your body still has a limited life expectancy.  And if you think dying is melancholy, then that is not the true liberation.  To be free from that idea of a physical body: the body does not exist in isolation.  It has a physical reality, and it also has, with this liberation, a need to do teaching.  And if we have a body, to use it for awakening and then to go into society with what we have realized and use that body to help bring others to liberation.  To even one day sooner realize liberation and bring it to all of society, this is what is most important and this the point of our body’s existence.  </p><p class="P1">Whether we have many awakened days or few awakened days, as many of those awakened days as we can get until our physical body needs to die from being physical, we should use our days to pass this liberation on to all beings.  Even if we are awakened, our body has to die.  We need to speak the words of liberation to others, and we need our body for doing this.  Because we live, we are able to spread this awareness of awakening.  The words that are telling of liberation are very important.  We can’t just be silent. Vimalakirti, speaking through the Goddess,  says that it has to be in this way: we use this body for liberation, not shying away from that, but to have this experience and then to bring it to all beings through this body and with these words.</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “Is it not also that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity?”</p><p class="P1">As Hakuin Zenji has said in his Song of Zazen, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning we cannot be any place else.  Realizing the thought of no thought as thought, whether singing or dancing we are the voice of the Dharma.”  This is not about us being caught on what we have realized and therefore thinking that it is something special.  We align and we realize it, and seeing this we express it, but we are not caught on being awakened because we have had some experience.  We are not caught on either saying hello and goodbye or on doing any of the things we do during our day.  We do them wholeheartedly,  and we offer everything that we learn and realize to others in this same way.  “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning, we cannot be any place else.”  Each mind moment is deeply steeped in this very clarity.  </p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “On behalf of the self-conceited, the Buddha explained that emancipation is the transcendence of licentiousness, anger, and stupidity. If one is not self-conceited, the Buddha explains that licentiousness, anger, and stupidity are emancipation.” 10. Śāriputra said, “Excellent, excellent! O goddess, what attainment do you have, and through what realization do you have eloquence such as this?” </p><p class="P1">Here, Vimalakirti is saying that liberation is not just about being freed from greed, anger, and delusion. Right in the middle of having those (feelings of desire, hatred, and folly), to not be attached.  This is where we find liberation.  </p><p class="P1">If you are awakened you can speak freely in order to bring this awakening to everyone.  But this is what Sariputra is still caught on. We have to see what the Buddha has helped us to realize: that it is important for us to not sit down on what we have understood, and to always be continuing in our awareness and deepening it.  To not only know that we should not be caught on greed, anger and delusion, but to live in a way that we are not caught on them while seeing that within them there is also a way to further liberation. Not to be thinking that only I am awakened and be proud of that, but to live from that awakened state in a way that others can learn from it.  And here he is saying that if you are still moved around by greed, anger and ignorance, or if you are still moved around by time, by space, and by acquiring, that is not true liberation.  The Buddha had said, “Those who are not caught on those attributes are those who are humble.  And those who are humble are those who are free of pride and can see that from the very nature of desire, hatred and folly, one can realize liberation.”  This is the true liberation.  </p><p class="P1">To be able to see this we have to let go of our own idea of being special and let go of our attached feelings of greed, fear, and anger.  But to see that within those three feelings, there is also a liberation possible:  we have to have the honesty to see ourselves clearly in relationship to these feelings.  What the Buddha has taught is what the Goddess is telling Sariputra.  But Sariputra is still caught on his idea of liberation being something which is more narrow.  This awakening has to be not only for a single person, but for the awakening of all beings.  And within that universal experiencing of desire, hatred, and folly, we find that liberation.  </p><p class="P1">Finally, finally, Sariputra has agreed. Excellent, excellent Goddess, pray what have you attained, what have you realized that you have such eloquence?  To be able to speak that truth, that is what is so important, otherwise how can we share it with other people?</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “It is because I am without attainment and without realization that my eloquence is like this. Why? If one had attainment and realization, this would be to be self-conceited with regard to the Buddha-Dharma.”</p><p class="P1">And the Goddess says that I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra.  I have no realization, therefore I have such eloquence.  Whoever thinks I have attained, I have realized, is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught Dharma. The very idea that I am awakened or that one is awakened, is an obstruction.  I have nothing that complex going on. The Goddess is not moved around by what Sariputra is saying in the slightest bit.  </p><p class="P4">11. Śāriputra asked the goddess, “Which of the three vehicles do you seek?” </p><p class="P1">And the Goddess answers,</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Since I convert sentient beings with the śrāvaka Dharma I am a śrāvaka. Since I convert sentient beings with the Dharma of causality I am a pratyekabuddha. Since I convert sentient beings with the Dharma of great compassion, I am a Mahayanist.</p><p class="P1"><span class="T2"> </span>Sariputra asks this question, still not realizing that the Goddess is a manifestation of Vimalakirti’s wisdom.  This is only a question one would ask the Goddess, assuming that she was not yet awakened, so it is not such a good question that Sariputra is putting to the Goddess here, bringing in these various vehicles, not only that of the Bodhisattva.  Here, however, she is answering straightforwardly that she is trying to awaken others with whatever means can best serve that person in that particular situation.  And she speaks from her core in this answer.  She explains how she considers the various vehicles and how their usefulness depends upon the person to be liberated.  No one vehicle should be used for every person in every situation. And as usual she refuses to be caught on his question and shows that she will align according to the situation.  In this way, the Goddess answers Sariputra.</p><p class="P4">12. “Śāriputra, just as a person who has entered a campaka forest can smell only campaka and no other smells, thus it is if you enter this room— you can smell only the fragrance of the Buddha’s merit and do not delight in smelling the fragrance of the merit of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.</p><p class="P1">The Goddess here gives her answer, saying that the Buddha taught according to each person’s capabilities and how that teaching is never fixed or permanent.  All is in flux, there is nothing fixed, and only if we can see this straightforwardly can we know this state of mind of the Buddha.  We hold the pain and the insecurity of others, and simultaneously realize that deeper place which is clear. Not being caught on one’s impermanent realization, but seeing there is always further to go.  </p><p class="P1">So, why does this anxiety then come up when we get older?  It is because we are always thinking that we are going to be young forever.  And so we live with our unlimited desires, spreading our anger in every direction, unable to contain that greed.  We have to stop putting pressure on others, trying to get what we think that we want out of everything and everyone.   There are so many people in this whole world with no food today.  When we see this suffering, we know how shallow we are when we chase around our impermanence by using our time and energy for getting that which we desire, focusing on our fear, and expressing our anger.   </p><p class="P1">Everyday we live our lives seeing how our bodies are dying. We have to see not only that but also that huge, clear, wide open emptiness of the great blue sky, that ancient sky.  We have to become this state of mind as well as the one that knows that we are not always going to be in this physical body.  </p><p class="P1">If that huge ancient wide open sky is eternal, then isn’t our mind eternal as well?  Don’t we just get caught on some idea of a small self?  We have to bring ourselves to see clearly how this is only a borrowed body.  As the great master Ikkyu said, “This body, which I have been able to use until this day, this month, this year, I now return.”  </p><p class="P4">“Śāriputra, those Indras, Brahmās, four heavenly kings, and the gods, dragons, and spirits who enter this room all hear this Superior One (i.e., Vimalakīrti) explain the correct Dharma, and they all leave delighting [only] in the fragrance of the Buddha’s merit and generating the intention [to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi].</p><p class="P1">No matter what we are caught on, to let it go, to see this immense, clear mind, which is like that huge blue sky, and realize that we are that hugeness of mind.  We do have to develop it and apply it in many small ways to do different things in our daily life, but instead of seeing that as who we are, to make efforts together for all people. To not divide that state of mind into small pieces, but to live under that huge sky and realize that as our eternal mind.</p><p class="P4">“Śāriputra, I have stayed in this room twelve years. From the beginning I have not heard the Dharma of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha; I have only heard the buddhas’ inconceivable Dharma of the bodhisattvas’ great sympathy and great compassion.</p><p class="P1">“I have been here in this house for twelve years,” but this is not about time.  It might not be about years but could be about cycles, weeks, or months; twelve just stands for many, whether it’s years, cycles, or months.  </p><p class="P1">Sariputra, I don’t remember exactly how long I have been here but I have only ever heard of the great vehicle here, nothing about dividing and enumerating, only to forget yourself and teach for others.  There has never once been any talk of dividing it into small parcels of teaching or ways of teaching.  Liberation is about all of those ways of teaching at their appropriate moment.  We reach people by different ways because they are all expressions of the wisdom of the Buddha.  And all of these means are the expression of the one great teaching. In this way the Goddess teaches.</p><p class="P1">Sariputra was the most wise of all the disciples, and because of that he is made the bad guy in this section.  If one has deep wisdom, it is essential to not be conceited about having that deep wisdom.  Wisdom has no limits.  It has to be constantly deepened.  It cannot be left unripe and narrow.  </p><p class="P1">We have to open our mind to its greatest possible extent for the sake of all people, so that each and every one can realize this huge mind, free of all attachments and obstructions.  And then, realizing the truth of the Buddha-dharma, it does not end even with that: for all of us, then, to do a huge cleaning of our mind and let go of all of our tangled and unnecessarily confused and unrealized places. This hugeness is available for anyone, but if we stay caught on being a small self, which is divided and isolated, we cannot realize this hugeness of mind.  To believe in humans’ truest deepest core, to help others realize that, and to live from that core ourselves: this is the way of truth.  </p><p class="P1">We have the four immeasurable ways of true mind—to live in infinite love, to live in infinite realization, and to endlessly support each other in doing this.  To know this place and to help each other realize it and live together.  To take care of each other’s insecurities. To make these efforts continually.  This is what is being taught here.</p><p class="P4">13. “Śāriputra, this room constantly manifests eight unprecedentedly rare dharmas. What are these eight?</p><p class="P1">The Goddess appears in Vimalakirti’s room and does a mondo with Sariputra, who keeps losing to her every time.  Finally, the heavenly being talks about the eight advanced Buddha qualities of Vimalakirti’s room.  In this place, there is a light brighter than gold, always shining, a light of wisdom as the Goddess describes it.  And anyone who has an insecure state of mind can find peace here.  </p><p class="P2">Harada Roshi finds Mumon Roshi</p><p class="P1">From the Roshi’s own experience, from which he apologizes for speaking, he wants to tell about when he was a student and he went to Kyoto to do an errand for his father.  To do this errand he had to go on a bus from Kyoto station to the large headquarters temple, Myoshin-ji. It was about an hour away from the station by  bus.  The bus was filled with passengers on their way to work and school, many of them standing. He rode in this very full bus and noticed that everyone looked heavy and dark, challenged by this long, rush hour trip on their way to work or school.  But as he looked at the faces, suddenly there was one that was very different.  It was very bright.  And the person with this bright face was wearing a koromo.  It was a priest who had this bright face.  And when he went to get off the bus, at the stop where he had to do the errand for his father, he saw the priest getting off at the same stop.  The priest was going to Reiunin temple.  He could see this because he followed him.  From that moment, he decided that this person with this bright face would be the one he would continue to follow.  </p><p class="P4">i) “This room is always illuminated with golden light, with no variation day or night. It is not bright due to the illumination of sun and moon. This is the first unprecedentedly rare dharma.<span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">In our mind, there is for everyone this true bright light, and this great light will  enable us to see through all things.  This is possible for all beings. </p><p class="P4"><span class="T3"> </span>ii) “Those who enter this room are not afflicted by the defilements. This is the second unprecedentedly rare dharma.<br/>iii) “This room always has Indras, Brahmās, the four heavenly kings, and bodhisattvas from other regions who arrive and gather without interruption. This is the third unprecedentedly rare dharma.</p><p class="P1">We all want to meet someone who can receive our pressing and difficult qualities.  There are some people who are able to do that without our even knowing them.  Before we can even ask our question or express our deep need for an answer to somehow squelch our insecure mind, a person says something, or just by being the way they are, makes that very question disappear.</p><p class="P4">iv) “In this room there is constant explanation of the six perfections and the nonretrogressive Dharma. This is the fourth unprecedentedly rare dharma.</p><p class="P1">At Vimalakirti’s house, many gathered, but none of them there were anxious.  It is not necessary to understand small minded opinions.  Everyone there was settled and in harmony.  No one spoke of  disadvantages and dislikes, personal interest or personal attitudes.  In that atmosphere where there was nothing like that going on: this is how the Dharma was in Vimalakirti’s house.  And everyone, whether they were knowledgable about Dharma or not, they would be lifted up to know that deepest truth and moved to begin their path or to realize the next step along their way.  And this is the way it was in the house of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P4">v) “This room always produces the gods’ supreme string music, which generates the sound of the teaching of the immeasurable Dharma. This is the fifth unprecedentedly rare dharma.</p><p class="P1">The Goddess who was there arranged it so that you always heard music in Vimalakirti’s room.  The Roshi knows of a temple where he would go with Mumon Roshi, when he was alive, as his attendant.  The priest there had a particularly loud voice, and he was in charge of finances at Hanazono University, where Mumon Roshi was the head person. So they would discuss this, and the priest would always be speaking loudly in his booming voice.  Roshi remembers that at the end of their discussions Mumon Roshi would say to him, “I ask your best,” at which point this priest would stop all of his talking.  And then there would be silence.  In that silence, when this man’s huge, creative, working voice stopped, it was so quiet that the sounds of the cicadas would be louder than he ever had heard them before. </p><p class="P4">vi) “This room has four great storehouses filled with the many jewels, which are given to the destitute and used to save the poor without limit. This is the sixth unprecedentedly rare dharma.</p><p class="P1">And what were these treasure houses that were found here at Vimalakirti’s?  They were the treasures of offering and using kind and loving words, and there was always someone there who needed this.  One could always come there and be spoken to with kind words emphasized. This is one of the greatest treasures of Vimalakirti’s house.  There are places where people always come, and places where people don’t come so often.  </p><p class="P1">Omori Sogen Roshi, who trained with Yamada Mumon Roshi, would say, “There are always people coming to Mumon’s place.  He always has a huge stash of things that people are bringing to him.  But why don’t they come to my place?”  Mumon Roshi would always, always, give whenever anybody came to see him.  Even if a student asked and he said, “Are you asking me for an allowance again?  You just asked me the other day.”  But then after saying he shouldn’t be relied on so heavily, he would immediately give him more allowance.  Eventually, he would give it in every case, even when the  situation was shady.  </p><p class="P1">Anybody who saw these people coming in and asking Mumon Roshi for money would say, “What is he doing, giving these people money?”  They would come to request more favors and more favors and he would always give them what they asked for.  He would sometimes get furious—described as a person who has triangular eyes—with his monks.  But when people would come and ask him for something, he would always laugh and smile and give them whatever they wanted.  </p><p class="P1">Even though he was offered a medal of honor from the country, he said, “No, thank you.”  He had no use of that.  He had already received the medal he needed from the Buddha.  He needed nothing more.  </p><p class="P4">vii) “To this room Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, Jewel Virtue Buddha, Jewel Mirage Buddha, Jewel Moon Buddha, Jewel Ornament Buddha, Difficult to Overcome Buddha, Lion’s Echo Buddha, and Achievement of All Benefits Buddha, and the immeasurable buddhas of the ten directions such as these all come when the Superior One is mindful of them; and they extensively explain to him the buddhas’ secret Dharma storehouse and, having explained it, then return [to their own worlds]. This is the seventh unprecedentedly rare dharma.</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti’s room, not only held Shakyamuni Buddha and Amitabha, but also all of the others listed there.  They would all give their particular secret teachings.  And Vimalakirti would simply listen, humbly, and say, “Yes! Yes!”  Listening to what they said and then sending them on their way.  Everyone was so happy that he had listened to them and allowed them to teach.  The advanced disciples were glad to hear all of these various teachings, yet these were never obstructions to what they were doing in their practice, just many different versions of the same teaching.  And no one would have any preconceived notions, but listen openly to all of them.  </p><p class="P4">viii) “In this room appear all the ornamented palaces of the gods and the pure lands of the buddhas. This is the eighth unprecedentedly rare dharma.“Śāriputra, this room always manifests the eight unprecedentedly rare dharmas. Who could see these inconceivable things and still take pleasure in the śrāvaka Dharma?”</p><p class="P1">An abundance of different teachings and information was brought into this one space and shared continuously:  it would not seem so strange today, with our access to the internet.  But in those days it was astonishing, and this is how they realized Dharma brilliantly.  Learning things directly—right in front of their faces, saying at the same time that they were not yet fulfilled in their understanding of the Dharma.  All of them very humbly knew that even with all of this, it was still not sufficiently developed within each of them.  </p><p class="P4">14. Śāriputra said, “Why do you not transform your female body?”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “For the past twelve years I have sought the characteristic of being female and have comprehended it to be unattainable (i.e., imperceptible). Why should I transform it? It is as if a magician has created a conjured female. If someone asked her, ‘Why do you not transform your female body?’ would that person’s question be proper or not?”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “It would not. An indeterminate characteristic that has been conjured—why should it be transformed?”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “All dharmas are also like this, in being without determinate characteristics. So why do you ask, ‘Why do you not transform your female body?’”</p><p class="P1">Sariputra spoke so condescendingly to the Goddess because he had not yet seen that the Goddess was a manifestation, a version, of Vimalakirti.  And here, again, when it says, “Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years,” the  term “twelve years” refers to some long, indeterminate period of time.  In the same way that Hakuin Zenji wrote, “Realizing the form of no form as form, whether going or returning, we cannot be any place else.”  This form of no form is what is being talked about: letting go of an idea of a female state since no such thing is possibly describable.  We don’t eat differently because we are male or female.  We eat and do zazen and samu wholeheartedly, not differently because we call ourselves a male or a female.  The Goddess tells how it is a fact, Vimalakirti never falls into that rather common idea that if a woman was very lucky in her next incarnation, she might be incarnated as a man.  </p><p class="P4">15. Then the goddess used the power of numinous penetration and changed Śāriputra’s body to be like that of a goddess, and she transformed her own body to be like Śāriputra. She then asked, “Why do you not transform this female body?”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra, in the goddess’s form, answered, “I do not know how you transformed me now into this female body.”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Śāriputra, if you were able to transform this female body, then all females would also be able to transform themselves. Just as Śāriputra is not female but is manifesting a female body, so are all females likewise. Although they manifest female bodies, they are not female.</p><p class="P4">“Therefore, the Buddha has explained that all dharmas are neither male nor female.”</p><p class="P1">This is to show you that all things are not male or female.  The Goddess then offers another way to look at this.  Can one really say being male is better than being female?   This is an idea of a difference only;  It is not real, but only an appearance. It is only something imagined.  It does not exist in the absolute.  In the spring the flowers bloom, but are these flowers male or female?  In the summer, a tree becomes full of leaves.  These leaves, are they male or female?  In the winter, the branches remain with no sign of life on them anywhere.  Are these branches male or female?  All of these things are form.  They are not permanent but always in transition. As the Goddess was saying, all of these have no defined existences, male or female.  </p><p class="P1">Then the Goddess turned herself into Sariputra and asked the female version of Sariputra, “What are you doing in a female form now?”  This was to show that all things are not male or female, that that is only a matter of kimono, appearances.  “You may be deeply awakened, but you are still confused about the appearance of male and female,” she says to Sariputra.  You have to see all of this differently: endowed with these forms, we support each other from within these forms, but it is the true master, which is beyond these forms, which must be realized.</p><p class="P4">At this point the goddess withdrew her numinous power, and Śāriputra’s body returned to as it was before.</p><p class="P4">The goddess asked Śāriputra, “Now where does the characteristic of form of the female body occur?”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”</p><p class="P1">What Vimalakirti really is trying to say here is that, in fact, there is nothing about being male or female that is beyond appearances.  Our truest nature is not male and is not female.  And because we know this, we can use that original nature and also that form of being male or female fully without confusion and see how all people, no matter what form, are equal.  </p><p class="P1">In the world there are men and women, and from that form all functioning is born.  But the true nature is not distinguished by being male or female.  We are all that truest center and from that center, we make use of our male or female form and our clear nature to offer everything to society.  We have to honor and respect each other’s appearance.  We have to see that each and every person has a clear human mind.  And to be able to see it in the same way that we see the trees and rivers and mountains: all have a value, their own particular individual value, and all are absolutely equal.  Seeing it this way is how everything can be truthfully realized.</p><p class="P1">Today it is still not truly equal, but 2,500 years ago there was even more prejudice and discrimination.  It was the Mahayana from that time on that taught to let go of the view that held to discrimination between men and women, and see them as equal.  And to let go of any idea that women can be liberated only when they are reborn into a further life in the future.  Therefore it was the Mahayana that was able to guide people, all people, to awaken now (not that some of us have to wait for a future opportunity).  </p><p class="P1">It’s like the Sixth Patriarch said when he was challenged at the place of the Fifth Patriarch, where he was called a person from an undeveloped part of China: “In the Buddha nature there is no north or south.  In the clear original mind there is nothing to be discriminated against.”</p><p class="P1">The Goddess releases Sariputra from the form of a woman and brings him back to his original form with a final statement of how it actually is, beyond prejudice.</p><p class="P4">The goddess asked Śāriputra, “Now where does the characteristic of form of the female body occur?”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”</p><p class="P1">The wisdom of Vimalakirti is the expression of the Mahayana teaching that everyone is endowed with the Buddha nature.  To make this even more clear, this Goddess and Sariputra are having a conversation here in Vimalakirti’s Sutra.  This sutra is the most like an opera, with many stories and characters.  At this point in the opera it is teaching that there should be no discrimination between  persons who are male or female because within the form of things everything is one and equal.  But here, this idea is dramatized: the Goddess who is representing the female, turns Sariputra, who represents the male, into a woman, and then she becomes Sariputra.  </p><p class="P1">Then the Goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary form.  She then said to him, “Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with your female form?”  It appears that we have a particular form of being a man or being a woman.  These trillions of cells, which make up a human body, some of them become our eyes, some of them become our ears. Some become an intestine and some become a bone.  And this is how a human being’s body is produced.  </p><p class="P1">It is the same in this world: we can’t eat only fish all the time.  So we don’t have only fishermen and fish sellers and people who bring fish to the market. We also need spices.  And we need clothes for the four rotating seasons.  And so we have many different people doing many different kinds of jobs.  Many material things that are useful.  This is the truth of the world of material things, all through it. </p><p class="P1">Even so, if it’s a man it’s still Buddha nature, a woman is Buddha nature, a child is Buddha nature, an adult is Buddha nature, a sick person is Buddha nature, a healthy person is Buddha nature.  A person who is working is Buddha nature, one who is not working is Buddha nature.  Everyone expresses something different, but everyone’s source is one and the same. No matter what version of human being we are, we are able to actualize it and bring it forth into the world.  This is humans’ way of being and our wisdom and that is what is being taught here.</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “The characteristic of form of the female body is without occurrence and without non-occurrence.”</p><p class="P1">The Goddess shows Sariputra with her supernatural powers how it is to be a woman.  And once he’s understood this she releases him back to his usual form as a Sariputra, teasing him by asking where has his female form gone.  And in this way, Sariputra responds, “I neither made it nor did I change it.”  The body is always changing in every instant.  It only looks this way in this very second.  </p><p class="P1">Before lunch, when we are hungry, we can become very irritable.  But after lunch we are calm and easy, just with the difference of one single meal.  We think we are the same person all the time, but we are always changing.  We are always without any permanent, fixed form.  This is the way that it is said  in the teaching of Hakuin Zenji: “Realizing the form of no form as form”. This no form way of being, we mentally understand it, and yet we then look for a something called a no form.  </p><p class="P1">Muso Kokushi, the founder of Tenryu-ji, whose name meant “dream window”, was always traveling—to Kyoto, to Tokyo, never staying in any single place and residing there.  And someone asked him what this was like, to abide nowhere.  Muso Kokushi said, “No, it wasn’t about abiding nowhere.”  He never went anywhere.  He was always in his own house, on this planet.” </p><p class="P1"> Just like how we don’t think that we are going somewhere when we go into the next room in our house.  We go into a bathroom, we go into a living room.  We don’t think, “Now I have gone somewhere.”  In the same way, on this planet, wherever we are is the place that we are at that time.  The planet, all over, is our house.  It is not that we have gone some place, nor did we come back from some place.  We’re always right where we are.  </p><p class="P1">This is true for a child or for a person who is an adult.  We become that moment’s appropriate state of mind.  And we can always encounter a person with their similar state of mind: meeting a child, we become like a child; meeting an adult, we are like an adult.  </p><p class="P1">As Hakuin Zenji has said in his work, the Song of Zazen, “As with water and ice, there is no ice without water. Apart from sentient beings, there are no Buddhas.”  Water in a cup can then be poured out of a cup and into a plate.  And the water from the plate can then be poured into a jar.  This is the truth of no form. But if we are always holding onto a hardened fixed form of an “I” or a “me, me, me” we cannot fit into anything else. But people are always being caught on the form.  This is what the Goddess is teaching this Sariputra.  </p><p class="P1">When sitting, we do it with the state of mind of becoming that sitting.  When walking we become that state of mind of walking, and when we are working we become the state of mind of working.  It cannot be understood conceptually but only by becoming it completely.  </p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “All the dharmas are also likewise, in being without occurrence and without non-occurrence. This ‘without occurrence and without non-occurrence’ is as the buddhas have explained.”</p><p class="P1">That is true, and not only for humans.  It is also true of soft new leaves, which develop into stronger, firm, deeper green leaves.  And with the chill of Autumn winds, those leaves change into brilliant colors, dance, swirl, fall to the ground. When the snow comes, the branches are bare with no more leaves there.  But the leaves do not no longer exist; they have become the earth, the flowers, the bark.  </p><p class="P1">Our forms are always changing, and that is how it is in the world: that in every instant, everything is changing.  In India, for example, we have the Indus river and the Ganges river. It seems that those are always the same rivers.  But each river, all rivers, are always changing.  If it was always the same river, then the water would become stagnant and rotten.  </p><p class="P1">The scenery of the fall and the scenery of the spring clearly inform us that we can stop being caught on conceptual ideas of what a particular piece of land should look like, because it is always changing.  Things don’t stay the same.  We have a concept of what it means to be old or elderly or young.  And we also have many, many, freer ways of looking at something.  </p><p class="P1">We don’t see in the same way that dogs, cats and rabbits see things.  Our perceptions are well aligned.  Our left and right eyes are in alignment and focus on a single point.  The evolution of our visual equipment  has enabled us to perceive well this abundantly filled world.  And we can see, in that way, from these eyes, how things are always changing, not only in regard to a thing, but also in a place, and in a moment.  We do what is on our mind;  we see flowers blooming, we see the petals falling.  Then we decide we would like to put this into a poem or share it with someone.  </p><p class="P1">So, while the object  is always changing form, so also is the way  we receive and express these things. We have to be able to  grasp this in our deepest true heart, though.  To not always think that this moment is how things will always be.  Instead, to see that this is the way it is in this moment, only. To be able to really see this completely and totally, we do zazen.  </p><p class="P1">We do not do zazen to have lots of mozo and lots of extra thinking.  We do zazen to be in awareness, to receive and realize that which is true in the moment. If we can see this clearly, then we can make something.  And if we are not seeing things in this way, that it is always changing in every second, then we are making a big mistake.  </p><p class="P1">To see all the people just as they are, in their perfected mind, no matter how it is they may appear.  And from here comes this place where we can perceive what life is actually for, what our particular purpose is.  And then we can see that the singing bird and everything else is also changing.  And with this true deep awareness, we can guide and show it to others.  This is how the Dharma works, always, in each and every instant: with everything in transience, with everything different from how it was until now and different from how it will be from now.</p><p class="P4">16. Śāriputra asked the goddess, “When you die here, where will you be reborn?”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Wherever the Buddha’s [activity of] conversion is born (i.e., generated), likewise will I be born.”</p><p class="P4">[Śāriputra] said, “Where the Buddha’s [activity of] conversion is generated is not [a place] of death and birth.”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “Sentient beings are likewise without death and birth.”</p><p class="P1">In fact, Sariputra wouldn’t say something like that, but it is for the purpose of this story going as it has to go, that he says it.  When the Buddha was born, he was already dedicated to working toward the liberation of all beings for all the eighty years he was alive.  But we cannot, even hearing this, be deceived by an idea of things being fixed.  Realize that no matter what and who we are, if we have any idea of being that, then we have to pull off that ‘kimono’ and see what is actually there.  </p><p class="P1">But anyone with an awareness knows, as Master Ikkyu said, until today we’ve borrowed this body.  This body is a borrowed thing, and now we return it at this time, this very day.  We return this body, which we have been given to use.  In this always changing world, we are seeing how material things are like our body as well: they appear to exist in the way the flowers do in the spring, in the way the maple leaves turning colors exist in the autumn. </p><p class="P1"> “I leave no gifts,”  this is what the Master Ryokan said. “But when I die, I leave all these things to you.  These flowers in the spring, the cool wind in the summer, the turning leaves in the fall, the quiet snow in the winter.”  </p><p class="P1">Like the Buddha who has been telling us to see, “What is it that is looking at those flowers and those maple leaves?”  He never stops telling us this.  It has never died and has never been born.  This is not about some place.  There is nothing of truth in the whole world except that truth that everything is always changing, and that is the way of nature.  Our mind’s truest deepest wisdom must see this clearly, or how can we know this truest deepest amazement.</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra asked the goddess, “How long will it be until you attain anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi?”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “When you are reborn as an [unenlightened] ordinary person, I will achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “For me to be an ordinary person—this will never happen!”</p><p class="P4">The goddess said, “My attaining of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi—this too will never happen. Why? Bodhi is without any locus of abiding. Therefore there is no one who attains it.”</p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “The buddhas who attain anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, including those who have attained it and those who will attain it, are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. What about all of them?”</p><p class="P1">Sariputra says this to the Goddess: “For what then did Buddha leave behind all of those sutras and tell us to awaken, even a day sooner.  Why are there so many monks, more than the grains of the Ganges’ sands. How could she say that there is no awakening?</p><p class="P4"><span class="T3">”</span>The goddess said, “It is entirely through conventional words and numbers that one talks of the existence of the three periods of time. It is not that there is past, future, and present in bodhi!”The goddess said, “Śāriputra, have you attained arhatship?”</p><p class="P1">This is the Goddess speaking.  “You are playing around with words and concepts, and your true mind won’t be realized by doing that.  Who is it that says those words?  And who is it that is hearing them?”  She continues, “You are grasping after a clear mind you think you have left behind somewhere.  Tell me, elder, have you attained sainthood?  If you think you are awakened or if you think you are not awakened, that is all only fooling yourself.  There is no such form to be grasped, nor is there anything to be achieved or acquired.  So there is nothing to say you understand and no attachment to anything. Isn’t that attaining sainthood?”  Even if monks, as many as the sands of the Ganges, should awaken, they were still never without that originally clear mind.  Don’t be deceived by any shadow of it.  Nor does that mean that there is nothing to do and nothing to be done.  What does that mean that there is nothing to do? Nor should we be staying deluded eternally if we don’t realize this.  Don’t be scared by your own shadow.<span class="T2"> </span></p><p class="P4">Śāriputra said, “There is no attainment, and so have I attained it.” </p><p class="P1">The goddess said, “The buddhas and bodhisattvas are also like this. There is no attainment, and so have they attained <span class="sanskrit">anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi</span>.”</p><p class="P1">Master Bankei Zenji says in his teaching on the Heart Sutra, that the human mind is like a mirror.  Just because something is reflected in the mirror doesn’t mean the mirror gets heavier.  Or if something unpleasant is reflected in the mirror it doesn’t become damaged, nor is the mind harmed by something which is reflected in it.  Nor does it increase because something is reflected there and decrease when the reflection goes away.  These are all words from the Heart Sutra.  It comes, it’s there, it goes.  And the mirror is then again empty without a trace.  This is the teaching of Bankei Zenji.  </p><p class="P4">17. At this time Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “The goddess has already served ninety-two koṭis of buddhas. She is able to disport in the numinous penetrations of the bodhisattva, her vows are complete, she has attained forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas, and she abides in nonretrogression. By virtue of her original vows she is able to manifest the teaching of sentient beings as she wishes.”</p><p class="P1">Since Sariputra is in the room with Vimalakirti, we just had a momentary change of scenery here.  Vimalakirti tells Sariputra this is not just your regular, ordinary Goddess you’re talking to here.   She is filled with her great vow in every single instant, in every single direction, and in every single location. She takes every opportunity to liberate others, becoming every form in the world possible, like Kannon taking all forms.  This is her way of offering us challenges that are difficult—sometimes even becoming awful, terrifying forms that have to be caught by the policemen.  But these are to offer us bad examples as well, giving us wisdom in the reverse way.  </p><p class="Standard">That is the way of teaching when we become sick or when we die suddenly—teaching that it is only this one instant that we can know.  Suddenly a parent dies or a child dies.  We feel as if we have been dropped from heaven into hell in one instant.  We experience this and we realize that all of these experiences give us deepening wisdom.  All kinds of people, all kinds of experiences—we can see that wisdom from all of them.  We receive that wisdom and that teaching in many ways so that we can know these infinite forms of functioning.  And this is the way that Vimalakirti is teaching us.</p></body></html>
