The important aspects have already been read together  so the difficult teachings are not found in the forth coming sections. The way of the Vimalakirti Sutra is like an opera on a great stage with a deep and direct affect, not only in explanation in words, but a deepening of awareness as we encounter it. </p><p class="P1">In this chapter we have the whole universe as the scene of this opera. While many countries are involved, they are not only countries on this planet. Now we go beyond our awareness of just the our countries of our own planet, and there are those who are not only human. A universe of beings who are drowning in greed, anger and ignorance, and swimming in infinite wisdom, magnanimous and vast in their views. </p><p class="P1">This world is as far away as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers. There is a land called Shukokoku, and in Shukokoku, the country of Shuko. In Shuko there is Koshaku Butsu. Soon a being will be sent to receive a bowl of food from Koshaku Butsu that will easily feed all the myraid  beings who fill Vimalakirti’s room. </p><p class="P2">1. At this point Śāriputra thought to himself, “It is almost noon. What will all these bodhisattvas eat?”</p><p class="P1">Sariputra was the disciple of the Buddha with superior wisdom and ability. The Vimalakirti Sutra is a great advertisement for the Mahayana, we are in the world of the Buddha’s deep awakening. We are living not from a place of holding on to our own training, but working for all beings to realize their true deepest wisdom.</p><p class="P1">People who live in the world cannot practice in the same way as ordained people. But to the Buddha that there was no difference in their ability to awaken. To bring to life one’s awakening while being in a household is the way of the Mahayana. While living in the world, in society, we can realize great awakening. To realize this, we first bow and offer our life for all people. This is the way of the bodhisattva, who practices not only for their personal awakening but for the awakening of all beings. </p><p class="P1">So all the main disciples of the Buddha appear. Sariputra rarely ever gets a good role as an actor in these interactions with the Buddha. There is 84,000 bodhisattvas and they are all standing up in Vimalakirti’s sick room for a long, long time. Suddenly, Sariputra thought how they should all have chairs, they’ve been standing so long. As he thought about manifesting them, Vimalakirti said, “Did you all come here to visit or to have a chair?”  And immediately Vimalakirti produced glorious chairs, 84,000 of them and they are delivered from the heavenly realm to his tiny, tiny room-in comparison, the size of a poppy seed. This shows the hugeness of mind, going beyond any dualism such as big and small. Where true wisdom goes, it is beyond any relative views. </p><p class="P1">Now, a long time has passed and Sariputra wonders  whether everyone is becoming hungry?  As this takes place in India you can’t eat even a minute after noon. You eat a before noon, digest in the afternoon so that in the evening zazen, can be done without the burden of digestion. In India, they only eat one or two meals a day before  noon for this reason. People eat in the evening because we are less focused on a meditative way of life. So Sariputra had realized all these bodhisattvas must be fed before noon. </p><p class="P2">Then Vimalakīrti, knowing his thoughts, said, “The Buddha has explained the eight emancipations. You, sir, have accepted them as your practice. How can you mix up the desire for food and [that of] listening to the Dharma? If you wish to eat, then just wait a moment. I will provide you with an unprecedented meal.”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti caught telepathically what it was that Sariputra was thinking about, that it was time to feed everybody, and reprimanded him for not paying attention to the teaching of the eight liberations by the Buddha. We are hearing about the eight liberations and how to be not suffering no matter what you are surrounded by, to not be moved around by any of it. Here we are with the Buddha, giving a teaching simultaneously with all the 84,000 being at the place of Vimalakirti and suddenly food is an issue.</p><p class="P1">The bodhisattvas have all come to visit Vimalakirti and  the Buddha’s teaching of the eight liberations is happening right in front of them. This teaching is truly the mysterious world of the not-two. To be suffering and at the same time to not be moved around by that suffering whatsoever, to be in the middle of things and not be moved around by them is the point of the eight ways of liberation. </p><p class="P1">First of all, to realize that our bodies are impure. We have mucus in our nose, we have drool in our mouth, we have gook in our eyes, and our skin is flaking of and our hair falling out. In order for the body to live it has to discharge endless by-products and we are not pure in the letting go of those. </p><p class="P1">Also, we are greedy desirous beings. We think there is so much in the world that we want to have and keep, but it’s all only transient phenomena. We desire so many things, but there is nothing that can truly satisfy us. </p><p class="P1">So no matter what comes forth, to not be moved around by it. Humans always want something. Something delicious. Something beautiful. Some fame. Some money. All these things can move us around. People will use our desires for all of these things to have us do what they want. Instead,  actualize completely the mind that is not moved around and manipulated by any of that. These are all ways for liberation. </p><p class="P1">All of it, every single bit of it, is phenomena. There is nothing but phenomena, but we are deluded by it and so we have to look closely at our delusion of how we think that there is something other than phenomena. </p><p class="P1">Due to our memory and our past experience we think, “I want this. We must to have that.”  In the moment it all appears so important. We remember things and think that because of that memory we must have a something. We have to realize that  all of this is confusion. </p><p class="P1">Know that there is nothing that can be possessed, there’s nothing that we can possibly call our own. Even do not think about not thinking of any of this. Finally, seeing that we are constantly moved around by things and knowing that; do not be moved around by or deceived by any of the phenomena whatsoever.</p><p class="P2">Then Vimalakīrti, knowing his thoughts, said, “The Buddha has explained the eight emancipations. You, sir, have accepted them as your practice. How can you mix up the desire for food and [that of] listening to the Dharma? If you wish to eat, then just wait a moment. I will provide you with an unprecedented meal.”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti is saying to Sariputra, to be the very midst of all of these phenomena and not be moved around by any of it is exactly what the Buddha is teaching and yet in the very midst of this teaching, here you are thinking about food. Just wait a minute and I will bring for you such food to partake of that you have never experienced before.</p><p class="P2">2. Then Vimalakīrti entered into samādhi and, using his powers of numinous penetration, manifested to the great congregations that in the upper direction, past buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there was a country called Host of Fragrances, with a buddha named Accumulation of Fragrances, who currently exists in that world. In comparison with the world-systems of the other buddhas thoughout the ten directions, the fragrances [experienced by] the humans and gods of that country are supreme. In that land, the names “śrāvaka” and “pratyekabuddha” do not exist—there is only the great congregation of pure bodhisattvas, for whom the Buddha explains the Dharma. In that world all the buildings are made of fragrance. In doing walking meditation on that fragrant earth, the gardens are all fragrant. The fragrance of the food there circulates throughout the immeasurable worlds in the ten directions.</p><p class="P2">At the time, that Buddha and the bodhisattvas [in that country] were just sitting together to eat. The gods in attendance [in Vimalakīrti’s assembly] all exclaimed at the ornament of fragrance, and they all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, making offerings to that buddha and the bodhisattvas.</p><p class="P2">3. At that time, Vimalakīrti asked the congregation of bodhisattvas, “Sirs, who is able to go get food from that buddha?”</p><p class="P2">Through the influence of Mañjuśrī’s awesome numinous power, they all remained silent.</p><p class="P1">All of the disciples  were those who had turned down the request by Manjusri to go and visit Vimalakirti in the first pace, even the top ten disciples. However, when they heard that Manjusri and Vimalakirti were going to meet, they felt they couldn’t miss this and came along. And so, along with 84,000 bodhisattvas, they all felt that they had to keep behind Manjusri at his visit to Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “Sir, are you not ashamed for this great congregation?”</p><p class="P2">Mañjuśrī said, “As the Buddha has said, one should not belittle those of no learning.”</p><p class="P2">4. At this Vimalakīrti, without rising from his seat, created by transformation a bodhisattva whose [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks were radiantly bright, whose glorious presence was particularly excellent, surpassing all in the assembly.</p><p class="P1">Then, the Licchavi Vimalakirti, without rising from his couch, magically emanated an incarnation-bodhisattva.</p><p class="P2">[Vimalakīrti] announced to him, “Go to the world in the upper direction where, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there is a country named Host of Fragrances. The buddha [of that country], named Accumulation of Fragrances, is just sitting down to eat with the bodhisattvas. Go there, and say as I tell you: ‘Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-honored One, and with great respect he inquires immeasurable times as to whether you might have some slight illness, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace.</p><p class="P2"> He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the sahā world.</p><p class="P2">“‘It will cause those who delight in inferior dharmas to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the Tathāgata’s (i.e., Buddha Accumulation of Fragrances) reputation to be universally known.’”</p><p class="P1">In that way, the emanation bodhisattva  followed Vimalakirti’s instructions and  went to the place of Koshaku buddha. All of them could see the emanation as if they were right there with him. The shining emanation arrived and people of the Shuko country were astonished. </p><p class="P2">5. Then the conjured bodhisattva ascended to the upper direction in front of the assembly. The entire congregation saw him arrive at that Host of Fragrances world and worship at that Buddha’s feet. They also heard him say,</p><p class="P2">“Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-honored One, and with great respect he inquires immeasurable times as to whether you might have some slight illness, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace. He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the sahā world.</p><p class="P2">“It will cause those who delight in inferior dharmas to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the Tathāgata’s reputation to be universally known.”</p><p class="P2">6. When the great beings there saw the conjured bodhisattva, they exclaimed that it was unprecedented. “Where has this superior person come from? Where is the sahā world? What does he mean, ‘those who delight in inferior dharmas’?”</p><p class="P2">So did they question the Buddha [Accumulation of Fragrances], and that buddha said, “In the lower direction, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, is a world named sahā. The buddha there is named Śākyamuni, who exists at present in an evil age of the five corruptions. </p><p class="P1">If we have these five corruptions everything becomes murky. This very era becomes murky. People who are alive in this universe become murky. Their desires which were already attachments became ever more murky and complex. People are only guided by ideas of material things that they think they want. There’s no radiance anywhere. Thinking that money can buy us anything. Worshipping bankers and doctors and divorce lawyers. This is the way of the Saha lives.  As we actually see what is described is today as well is then. This is what Koshaku Butsu tells his bodhisattvas.</p><p class="P2">“He extensively disseminates the teaching of the path in order to enlighten those who delight in inferior dharmas. One of his bodhisattvas is named Vimalakīrti, who resides in the inconceivable emancipation and explains the Dharma for the bodhisattvas [of the sahā world]. Therefore, he has sent this conjured [bodhisattva] here to praise my name and extol this land, so that those bodhisattvas will increase their merit.”</p><p class="P2">7. The bodhisattvas there said, “How was he able to create this conjured [bodhisattva]? How great are his powers of merit, fearlessness, and the bases of numinous [power]?”</p><p class="P2">That Buddha said, “[Vimalakīrti’s powers are] extremely great. He sends transformations to all the ten directions, where they carry out the Buddha’s work and benefit sentient beings.”</p><p class="P2">The bodhisattvas exclaimed how great must that bodhisattva be  if this magical incarnation is thus endowed with supernatural powers, strength and fearlessness. Then after that the splendid Vimalakirti teaching of the Buddha’s way, they all wanted to see him having met his Emanation.</p><p class="P1">The mysterious way of the non-dual takes us beyond our usual dualistic ways of thinking to where we experience that we are this entire universe. Vimalakirti teaches that our mind is like a mirror, but so easily lost in thinking that we are the phenomena of this world. We are always perceiving and it is  from attachment to this that we must be liberated. Know that there is an inconceivable world which is our true nature from where all of this is being taught. </p><p class="P1">To realize our huge great wisdom. To not hold onto anything at all. Our extraneous thoughts that are like clouds in the sky. With no form and nothing that is real to them. We’ve only gathered these clouds from depending on a narrow mental idea of a world, unable to even imagine our huge original wisdom. To not hold onto anything, this is our original mind. All of the sadness, and the misery and the pain is only phenomena. Realize this directly and then we can see that we are not stuck in this idea of misery, nor are we especially fortunate to see the whole picture of it and not get caught on a partial view. See clearly  how all phenomena are phantoms. These are emanations which Vimalakirti is presenting and then erasing. We were so soaked in the delusion of a birth and a death, but our life is nothing so special. There is no mind and there is no matter that is appearing and then going away. Our true nature which has never become will never be destroyed. </p><p class="P2">8. Then Accumulation of Fragrances Tathāgata gave his bowl with its host of fragrances and filled with fragrant food to the conjured bodhisattva. The nine million bodhisattvas there then all spoke in unison, “We wish to proceed to the sahā world to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. We also wish to see Vimalakīrti and the other bodhisattva congregations.”</p><p class="P1">Sariputra had worried about it being time to eat for the 84,000 bodhisattva gathered in Vimalakirti’s very small room. His thoughts about material things were perceived by Vimalakirti and he was told to stop worrying about so many things material. Instead listen to Vimalakirti’s Dharma talk which was why everyone was there . He was chastised for his concern about the meal and was told to wait. There will be a great feast that would arrive. </p><p class="P1">Now, Koshaku buddha filled the bowl piled high with high quality fragrant food, and at the moment all of the 90 million bodhisattvas  said they wanted to go with that food, to the land of Saha and see all of those ignorant people. They couldn’t imagine it. They wanted to see all of it and meet Shakyamuni, the great Buddha and witness his infinite awareness and ability to guide the people of this deluded world. </p><p class="P1">All of this is different for those of us who are caught on a million small minded thoughts. It seems impossible, inconceivable, and that being shown to us. </p><p class="P1">Buddha’s awakening, if it is to be explained conceptually, is emptiness or void. Our tiny eye of only a few millimeters, can nevertheless, can receive inconceivably huge galaxies. Our wisdom is able to go faster than the speed of light, reaching the other side of the universe. But only if we are empty, in a state of mind of absolute clarity, where those ideas that we can do this, or can’t do that, or must do this, or it is impossible, all such ideas are let go. </p><p class="P1">Our mind changes in every instant. It truly does not stagnate. If we can realize this we’re not caught on an idea of something, and we can know the deepest wisdom. Don’t hold onto thoughts of, I couldn’t possibly do that, that’s impossible for me, who can do something like that?  Throw all of those thoughts away and find the space of infinite size and wisdom.</p><p class="P1">In this tiny room of Vimalakirti, a mere three meters square, sat 84,000 bodhisattvas each comfortable in a splendid chair. We have to let go of all of our preconceived ideas. Because we can’t let go of it, or we think it sounds like we are bragging if we do, we are not able to experience our truly abundant lives.</p><p class="P2">The Buddha said, “You may go.</p><p class="P2">“However, withdraw the fragrance of your bodies, so as not to cause the sentient beings there to generate thoughts of deluded attachment. Also, you should forsake your original forms, so as not to cause those seeking to become bodhisattvas in that country to be ashamed of themselves. In addition, you must not harbor feelings of belittlement or thoughts of the hindrances [present in that world]. Why? The countries of the ten directions are all like space (i.e., devoid of fixed reality). Furthermore, [you should realize] that the buddhas do not completely manifest their pure lands solely in order to convert those who delight in inferior dharmas.” Koshaku Butsu encouraged them, “Yes, you all, all of you, please go. You should all experience this. You all only know the Shuko country’s excellent fragrance. But beware, people of the Saha world, they will smell your excellent fragrance and they will feel impoverished, as if they’re missing something and jealous of it. So you have to all turn off your fine fragrances. </p><p class="P2">9. Then, by means of the Buddha’s awesome numinous [penetrations] and Vimalakīrti’s power, the conjured bodhisattva took the bowl and food and, accompanied by those nine million bodhisattvas, suddenly disappeared from that world. In an instant, they arrived at Vimalakīrti’s house.</p><p class="P1">Why in this wide, expansive universe is there something, a land like this?  It is because each world has its own very individual version of phenomena. All of the phenomena in any of the worlds is only transient and temporary scenery. The Saha world is only currently ugly and pitiful. They are choosing to live this way for awhile. It is not that Shuko country is good and that that land is terrible. That is only comparing temporary appearances and labeling them. That land has its own value. People there are making great efforts. It cannot be compared with here. You can’t confuse people there nor discriminate against them. To see through this and discover a world you have never imagined before. To increase your experience of truths you haven’t ever before encountered. If you can do it in this way, then I encourage you to go.</p><p class="P2">10. Vimalakīrti then created by transformation nine million lion seats, excellently ornamented as before, and the bodhisattvas all sat upon them. The conjured bodhisattva gave the bowl full of fragrant food to Vimalakīrti. The fragrance of the food wafted through Vaiśālī and the [whole] trimegachiliocosm. When the brahmans and retired scholars of Vaiśālī smelled this fragrance, their bodies and minds were joyful, and they exclaimed at the unprecedented [event]. At this, Moon Canopy, the leader of the elders, followed by eighty-four thousand people, came and entered Vimalakīrti’s house.</p><p class="P2">Seeing that the room contained so many lion seats, which were so tall and broad, with excellent ornamentation, in great joy they all worshiped the congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples, then stood to one side. The earth spirits, sky spirits, and gods of the desire and form realms, smelling this fragrance, also entered Vimalakīrti’s house.</p><p class="P1">Then, the incarnation-bodhisattva gave the vessel full of food to Vimalakirti, and the fragrance of that food permeated the entire great city of Vaisali and its sweet perfume spread throughout one hundred universes. </p><p class="P1">That food they had brought from Koshaku Buddha, it permeated all of these worlds with this great fragrance. Today’s imagination cannot get to those huge numbers easily. But it is not about mentally knowing about specific sizes of various worlds, rather it is about becoming them through our capability of becoming empty and void. </p><p class="P2">Seeing that the room contained so many lion seats, which were so tall and broad, with excellent ornamentation, in great joy they all worshiped the congregation of bodhisattvas and great disciples, then stood to one side. The earth spirits, sky spirits, and gods of the desire and form realms, smelling this fragrance, also entered Vimalakīrti’s house.</p><p class="P1">Brahmans and householders having noticed this fragrance, were amazed and filled with wonder. They were so cleansed in body and mind that they came at once to the house of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P1">Seeing there the bodhisattvas, seated on the high, wide and beautiful lion thrones, they were filled with admiration and great joy. They bowed down to those great disciples of the bodhisattvas and then sat down to one side. And the gods of the Earth and the gods of the desire world and the gods of the material world, attracted by the perfume, also came to the house of Vimalakirti. All of the disciples that had come from Shuko country, and the 84,000 bodhisattvas that were already there, along with all of the people who came to see and to smell this wonderful fragrance they all fit in this sick room. But this room could hold each and every one of them because it was Vimalakirti’s mind. </p><p class="P2">11. Then Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra and the other great śrāvakas, “Sirs, you may eat the Tathāgata’s food of the flavor of sweet dew, which is perfumed with the limitless intention of great compassion, and which will not be diminished by its consumption.”</p><p class="P1">Here is this food, but it is not your usual kind of food. It can only be received in its best fragrance and taste if your mind is empty completely. If you are only held in this shallow state of mind then you can’t digest it. In this way, it is being said about how it must be received because it is not our regular mind that is being discussed here. This is Vimalakirti’s very deepest pulse.</p><p class="P2">12. Another śrāvaka wondered, “There is not much of this food, yet everyone in the great assembly is supposed to eat!”</p><p class="P2">The conjured bodhisattva said, “Do not measure the limitless blessings and sagacity of the Tathāgata with the small merit and small wisdom of a śrāvaka! Even were the four seas to dry up, this food would not be exhausted. Even if everyone ate as much as [Mount] Sumeru for an entire kalpa, we would never be able to exhaust it. Why? That which is left over from the meal of someone who fully possesses the merits of morality, meditation, wisdom, sagacity, emancipation, and the vision and hearing of emancipation can never be exhausted.”</p><p class="P1">Some of them even thought that there might not be enough food, but he told them this is special rice. How can it possibly be exhausted?  Of course, you can feed everybody here. They had thought that it might not and were worried. But you cannot think of this with the concepts of a lot or a little. Or is there enough or there isn’t enough. This is a very special and unique food. If we eat this food we awaken. We develop our deep clear mind. And are not moved around by anything whatsoever. When we can realize that, there is nothing that can ever obstruct our mind. And for this reason this food can never be exhausted. The quality of it is such that it can never be depleted. And as they ate there was plenty for everybody. </p><p class="P2">The conjured bodhisattva said, “Do not measure the limitless blessings and sagacity of the Tathāgata with the small merit and small wisdom of a śrāvaka! Even were the four seas to dry up, this food would not be exhausted. Even if everyone ate as much as [Mount] Sumeru for an entire kalpa, we would never be able to exhaust it. Why? That which is left over from the meal of someone who fully possesses the merits of morality, meditation, wisdom, sagacity, emancipation, and the vision and hearing of emancipation can never be exhausted.”</p><p class="P1">The food in just one bowl brought from Shoku land fed every person there. Yet, never decreased a single bit. In Tolstoy it is spoken of about the five loaves and the two fish at the last supper. It’s called a miracle he said, but in fact, when it was offered to Christ, he said no he passed it onto Peter. And each one refused and passed it to the next one. All of them passing it on so it never decreased a bit, back to the very beginning with the same number of fish and loaves. This is not a miracle. This is from great love. This is bread and fishes of love, never to be exhausted. It has infinite functioning. Whoever eats it feels light and full of energy. And also it invigorates everyone and brings forth from them this sweet high quality fragrance as well. This is because they are not thinking of their small selves and their own satisfaction, but are filled with thoughts of others without any egoistic stench in their thinking or their state of mind. And in this way, there was no longer any mind set on material phenomena, only on giving life to all things. </p><p class="P1">Our zazen is the same. It is not about our individual physical state and how we personally feel. Zazen is about becoming one with 7.5 billion others. We let go of our small selves and become that universe size of state of mind and forget all of our personal discomfort. Zazen is not to be a struggle or a fight with ourselves, but to let go of all of our personal concerns and become all beings. And this is true zazen. And this is why one bowl of food from Shuko country could feed everyone. </p><p class="P1">If one person sits zazen with this huge abundant mind, the size of the universe, then it will be impossible to attack and dislike others from that state of mind. But our compassion widens infinitely in a whole world when we do and completely give ourselves to our zazen, not making it restricted feeling zazen, but to sit with our mind full and bright and abundant. But we all think thoughts such as, “This is my body,” or “These are my thoughts.”  We have to more and more be liberated from that narrow way of thinking. To open our mind beyond that idea of being this body or these thoughts to where we can experience our zazen in its own joyful truth. </p><p class="P1">And that moving is zazen, sitting is zazen, all of the various activities of the entire 24 hour day are our zazen. Sitting is only one form of expression of it, so we sit. But for 24 hours a day, to live with no small self, no egoistic filter coming into our mind, this is the truth of our zazen.</p><p class="P2">13. At this, the bowl of food satisfied all within the assembly, yet was unchanged and undepleted. The bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, and humans who ate this food became physically peaceful and happy, as if they were all bodhisattvas who take pleasure in ornamenting their [buddha] countries. Also, their pores all exuded wondrous fragrances, just like the fragrances of the trees of the Host of Fragrances country.</p><p class="P2">14. Vimalakīrti then asked the bodhisattvas from the Host of Fragrances [world], “How does Accumulation of Fragrances Tathāgata explain the Dharma?”</p><p class="P1">And now we have those bodhisattvas who have come from the far away land of Shuko. As far away as there are as a distance of all of the sands of forty-two Ganges rivers. Truly a world of finest fragrance and an abundant one. And on return, when they were about to go back to from, when Vimalakirti’s emanation was about to return to the Saha world, all the bodhisattvas of Shuko wanted to go back and also see the place where he had come from. And asked if they could also go with him to visit the Saha world. And with the blessings of the Buddha there, all of the 900 million bodhisattvas joined the 84,000 bodhisattvas in the small room of Vimalakirti. </p><p class="P2">Those bodhisattvas said, “In our land the Tathāgata explains [the Dharma] without words. He simply uses the host of fragrances to make the gods and humans enter into the practice of the Vinaya. The bodhisattvas each sit beneath fragrant trees, smelling such wondrous fragrances, from which they attain the ‘samādhi of the repository of all virtues.’ Those who attain this samādhi all become replete in the merits of the bodhisattva.”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti took the excellent fragrant food, which had been brought back from Shuko country. And with it the 84,000 bodhisattvas, all the visiting 90 million bodhisattvas as well as all of those that were gathered there together the Shakras, Brahmas, Locopalas and other living beings took the food. And they all wanted to know after they had had that food, how was the teaching done from the country of Shuko in daily life. And then in this way, it was described how it was done with fragrances.  </p><p class="P1">The Buddha there doesn’t teach with words. At the foot of a fragrant tree we sit. And with just that fragrance emanating from the tree, we are filled to overflowing with deep wisdom. This is a very high level of teaching. There is no verbal teachings. So what is it about it which is so splendid. Is it the teaching that is so splendid?  Or is it that it is taught only by emanation?  Or is that fragrance that is so splendid?  Or is it the excellent of the wisdom of the students who are learning by just having a fragrance?  Or is it that one who smells are those the ones most wonderful?  This is definitely a very high level, a purified level of education. Therefore it does not need any complicated language or concepts. Nothing so intricate. This is a sutra. Vimalakirti sutra. And for sutras there are some rules. </p><p class="P1">In the 9th chapter of Vimalakirti’s Sutra, it was taught about the central point of the entire sutra, the mystery of the not-two, which is emphasized throughout the text. And for this chapter as well. And from here on, how that mystery is taught is what is being expressed. The mystery of the not-two, the mystery of the non-dualistic. Where that which does the seeing and that which is being seen are not-two but one. There is no separation, nor dualism. Hearing a bird’s voice or a bell sound, without any concept about them, but at one with the sounds. </p><p class="P1">And this is the truth of the Buddhadharma. This is the way of expressing of the Buddha. When he had nothing in his mind, he was awakened, caught on nothing. Thinking of nothing whatsoever. And not with an idea of how empty and wise I am. Rather that society is me. So there is no idea about having to liberate society and help resolve pain, it happens of itself. When parents see their children sick, they feel the child’s sickness deeply. They find a doctor. The child recovers. The parents are greatly relieved, as if they themselves have been cured. And this is how, this is what is actualized in the mysterious way of the not-two. </p><p class="P1">This wisdom is something with which we are all endowed without exception. It is not about trying to understand this way of doing things or having a mental capacity which can or cannot do this. But by becoming this state of mind oneself. The fragrance represents the highest quality of all of our senses. This is why we have incense always being offered in the Buddha Hall. </p><p class="P1">Because like God, Buddha is not a form, but rather a state of mind. And that is why in Japan, also, there is a path of the many different kinds of paths such as tea or flower arranging. There is a path of incense. We first see things and then we smell. And in this great joy, there is a deep understanding of the very important quality and value of fine fragrance. These words I don’t know in English but the words in Japanese of the finest fragrance is some of them are: kyara, jako, jinko, very high level entertainment to be smelling these fragrances and distinguishing which is which. </p><p class="P1">To see things we can imagine their worth when we see their forms and we see what their substance is. But for a fragrance it is hard to know what combination of fragrances would be being burnt to experience so deeply their fragrances. And this is of course, indeed, a very high class hobby. </p><p class="P1">When we are first born, our smell is what is first. Later we continue and also it affects our ways of eating as well. Today we have so many produced things, so many things that have been hybridized and made in different combinations so that it is hard for us to know any longer what is the pure natural fragrances. </p><p class="P1">For example, humans have made things that are all artificial, but that also bring human allergies. But we have the toxins, the strong toxins that are human produced, such as Freon, plutonium, dioxine. And this isn’t about smelling those things, but to see clearly how humans have produced these things, to know that there also is this world of fragrance that can deeply raise our level of awareness.</p><p class="P2">15. Those bodhisattvas asked Vimalakīrti, “Now, how does the World-honored One Śākyamuni explain the Dharma here?”</p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “The sentient beings of this land are obdurate and difficult to convert, and so the Buddha disciplines them by means of stern language.</p><p class="P1">He, they taught that in this Saha world, because the people are so selfish, so egoistic, so stubborn and so twisted, not innocent and simple, and for this reason Shakyamuni had to teach strict and teach things very clearly with words. And this is how he puts it:  </p><p class="P2">“He says, ‘These are the hells, these are the animals, and these are the hungry ghosts. These are the places of difficulty, and these are the places where the foolish are born.</p><p class="P2">“‘These are licentious practices of the body, and these are the retribu- tions for licentious practices of the body. These are licentious practices of the mouth, and these are the retributions for licentious practices of the mouth. These are licentious practices of the mind, and these are the retributions for licentious practices of the mind.</p><p class="P2">“‘This is to kill sentient beings, and this is the retribution for killing sentient beings. This is to take what is not given, and this is the retribution for taking what is not given. This is licentiousness, and this is the retribution for licentiousness. This is false speech, and this is the retribution for false speech.</p><p class="P2">This is slander, and this is the retribution for slander. This is defamation, and this is the retribution for defamation. This is meaningless speech, and this is the retribution for meaningless speech.</p><p class="P2">“‘These are desire and jealousy, and this is the retribution for desire and jealousy. These are anger and vexation, and this is the retribution for anger and vexation. These are heterodox views, and this is the retribution for heterodox views. This is parsimony, and this is the retribution for parsimony. This is immorality (lit., “breaking the precepts”), and this is the retribution for immorality. This is anger, and this is the retribution for anger. This is laziness, and this is the retribution for laziness. This is perturbation, and this is the retribution for perturbation. This is stupidity, and this is the retribution for stupidity.</p><p class="P1">And in this way it was taught how there are the six realms of Hell beings, brutes, animals, humans and heavenly beings. It has to be taught strictly here. Therefore, threateningly that if we don’t do things in a positive way we will go to hell. So people can be directly informed, saying we have to realize wisdom or we will go to hell as well. That if we don’t do things that we’re supposed to then we will get punished for it. That our body is impure, that our mind is impure. That our mouth is impure. And so Shakyamuni tells us again and again and points out the mistakes that are impure body, mind and mouth, cause. And he is very strict. This is for liberating all beings. </p><p class="P1">The Buddha awakened and he was sitting under the Bodhi tree at that time. The very first thing he did was to go to teach his friends in the Deer Park. And the first sutra he offered them was that of the Kegon Kyo, or the Flower Garland Sutra. But nobody, not anybody could understand at all. And that is why he went back to it and wrote the Agon Sutra, telling simply to not do bad things, but to do do good things. </p><p class="P1">For the Agon Sutra, following that he wrote the Hodokyo. The Hodokyo which has several in it, one of which is the Vimalakirti Sutra, the one we are reading here today. And telling how humans should truly live in their daily life. Then we can come to understand the meaning of the Hannya Kyo, the state of mind of how we should live. And finally when we have understood all the teachings of those sutras before it, then there is the final one, for those we have awakened deeply to live in the way of the Lotus Sutra. </p><p class="P1">People could not understand the Buddha. They had no way of understanding what it was that he was teaching. And often found it so complicated and so difficult. But because people didn’t want to get it. It was because it was inconvenient for them to understand and live in terms of what he was saying, he decided to write all of these sutras, step by step so there would be not anyone left out and everyone could be included, clarifying their mind and all people could become awakened by these without exception. For these reasons, these methods see so full of concepts and ideas and words. </p><p class="P2">“‘This is to be bound by the precepts, this is to maintain the precepts, and this is to transgress the precepts. This is what you should do, and this is what you should not do. These are hindrances, and these are not hindrances. These are transgressions, and these are not transgressions (lit., “transcend transgression”). This is pure, and this is defiled. This is to have flaws, and this is to be flawless. This is the wrong path, and this is the correct path. This is the conditioned, and this is the unconditioned. This is worldly, and this is nirvana.’</p><p class="P1">All of the ten precepts telling us that we must not kill, not steal, not have sexual misconduct. That we can’t live in this way. To be able to see clearly and with detail how we had to carry ourselves.</p><p class="P1">The ten precepts are represented here and next the six paramitas. </p><p class="P1">This is just like when someone is trying to train a wild horse or it is like a monkey, a crazy monkey, who has lost his way. Or a cow who has gotten into a neighbor’s vegetable patch and is eating everything there. </p><p class="P2">“Since the minds of people so difficult to convert are like monkeys, one must use several types of Dharma to control their minds, so that they can be disciplined. It is like elephants and horses who are stubborn and uncontrollable, who can only be disciplined by making them suffer to the bone. Because the sentient beings [of this world] are obdurate like this, [Śākyamuni] uses all sorts of painfully strict language to get [sentient beings] to enter into the Vinaya.”</p><p class="P1">We cannot have simple monochromatic teachings from Shakyamuni. It has to be different for all the different crazes of all the different beings. Shakyamuni struggles greatly. People here are not well-behaved like the bodhisattvas of your land.</p><p class="P1">At this, all 90 million bodhisattvas from Shuko were greatly amazed at the teaching challenge of Shakyamuni Buddha, saying it as if a university professor is teaching kindergarten children. If it was high school students, it might not be so bad, but to have to go down to a level of kindergarten and teach every single part of it so clearly and they said this is established</p><p class="P2">16. When those bodhisattvas heard this explanation, they all said, “How unprecedented! Thus the World-honored One Śākyamuni Buddha conceals his immeasurable autonomous powers and uses that which is enjoyed by the poverty-stricken to save sentient beings. The bodhisattvas here are also able to labor and be humble, and it is with immeasurable great compassion that they have been born in this buddha land.”</p><p class="P1">In our everyday life we have to follow these teachings or we drift further from our possibility of awakening. Most important is the way of purification and clarification of the mind. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattvas of this land are resolute in their compassion for the sentient beings here. Truly, it is as you have said. Thus in a single lifetime they benefit more sentient beings than you do in that country (i.e., the Host of Fragrances world) in a hundred thousand kalpas of practice. Why?</p><p class="P1">The bodhisattvas are deep and wide in their vow. They are not moved around by trifles,  and in their own lives they continually strive to realize the teaching of the Buddha. </p><p class="P2">17. “This sahā world has ten excellent dharmas (i.e., features) that are lacking in the other pure lands. What are these ten?</p><p class="P2">“The poor are attracted by charity,</p><p class="P2"> “the transgressors are attracted by pure precepts,</p><p class="P2"> “the angry are attracted by forbearance,</p><p class="P2"> “the lazy are attracted by exertion,</p><p class="P2">“the perturbed are attracted by meditation,</p><p class="P2">“the foolish are attracted by wisdom,</p><p class="P2"> “those who experience the eight difficulties are saved by explanation of how to eliminate difficulties,</p><p class="P2"> “those who take pleasure in the Hinayana are saved by the teaching of the Mahayana,</p><p class="P2"> “those without merit may be saved by the various good roots, and </p><p class="P2"> “[the liberation of] sentient beings is constantly being accomplished by means of the four attractions</p><p class="P2">“These are the ten.</p><p class="P1">For those who have completely forgotten their path remind them that this path is not about material things in the world. Rather  the true way of great joy  is sharing virtuous deeds among people and helping them become good friends together. The world then becomes complete, perfect and peaceful. Being able to use their lives in this way, bodhisattvas fulfill a great need. </p><p class="P2">18. Those bodhisattvas said, “How many dharmas do bodhisattvas have to accomplish in their flawless practice in this world to be born in a pure land?” Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas accomplish eight dharmas in their flawless practice in this world so as to be born in a pure land. What are the eight?</p><p class="P2"> i) “They benefit sentient beings without seeking recompense, ii) “they experience various sufferings in place of all sentient beings, </p><p class="P2">iii) “they donate all the merit from their actions to others,</p><p class="P2">iv) “in humility and non-interference they are even-minded toward all sentient beings,</p><p class="P2">“they view [other] bodhisattvas as if they were buddhas,</p><p class="P2"> “they hear and do not doubt sutras they have not heard before, </p><p class="P2">vii) “they do not become refractory toward śrāvakas, and viii) “they are not jealous of the offerings [received by] others and do not become haughty over benefit to themselves. </p><p class="P1">For this reason there is a real purpose for the practice of bodhisattvas in our world. Thourgh the ten virtuous practices mentioned here, people who are immoral will be impressed when seeing people who show empathy. Not getting angry when they don’t understand what you are doing, rather been seen as making efforts in bodhisattva practice. The bodhisattvas sit quietly even though they are confronted by unruly behavior. Everyone is amazed at how unmoved around they are by things, and by this practice they can lead others. Everyone has so much ignorance complaining rather than doing, liberate from this and a great reward is ours. </p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti says that these people are unripe, giving all of these examples, there are many things that are incomprehensible for people to understand in this world. Then they asked how they go about this. It is said that a lotus flower does not live in rarefied mountain air but rather it comes forth from the mud and the swamp. When the mind is still, it’s great radiance is realized no matter where it is located and arises. </p><p class="P2">“In these [eight dharmas] they discipline their minds, always reflecting on their own errors and not proclaiming the shortcomings of others, yet always singlemindedly seeking the various merits. These are the eight dharmas.”</p><p class="P2">When Vimalakīrti and Mañjuśrī explained this Dharma to the great congregation, a hundred thousand gods and humans all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, and ten thousand bodhisattvas attained the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas.</p><p class="P1">Truly, when we look at how society is, if we take away all the scandals and all the terrible things in the newspaper, there is nothing left to read. For humankind to awaken, this is something that nobody is looking to as a solution. That anyone in this world would want to do that in this world which is full of profit and personal benefit. In that world to work on liberating others from their pain and suffering. </p><p class="Standard"> But because we know that pain, we know the need and make great, greatest efforts for that which are necessary in order to have a way to come to a place like this and do a sesshin like this. To leave a path to liberate for others to come following us. For those screaming and tortured in this hell like world. To drop down even a single silver thread to liberate others. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us about the bodhisattvas way of being so we don’t decrease our own efforts. Bodhisattvas are the greatest resource of the world is what is being taught in this chapter.</p></body></html>
