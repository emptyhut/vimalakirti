We all have this innate pure, clear wisdom within.  And it is that wisdom from which we have to live.  </p><p class="P2">When we are able to use these words, “buddhahood”, “the Buddha Dharma”, “the Buddha way”, any of them, we need to see clearly the basic laws of the Universe.  These are laws of nature, so they must be followed each day by every person.  That is each person’s work to do. No matter what state or country we are in, this is the same anywhere.  Because this is how we can live on a path which, whether we know it or not, we are all living on all the time.  </p><p class="P2">In order to live on this path, in the way of the Dharma, one of the very first things we have to be able to do is to do good things and not to do bad things.  We have to drop our narrow idea of what it is a self has to do.  Putting this idea to work in our daily life, especially concerning sickness and health, we have to not be too focused on thinking about our physical body. To be able to see that we are not this physical body, but at the same time to take care of it in a wisely.  In this way, we can truly clarify the best way to keep ourselves healthy. To truly clarify what we are doing all the time is the way to see if what we are doing is in the way of truth or going against it.  </p><p class="P3">Mañjuśrī then asks, “How does the bodhisattva traverse the unacceptable paths?”</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti is being asked, here, how we can in our everyday life live like a bodhisattva. Manjusri is speaking about all of those bodhisattvas who work in the world—all those who are awakened and offer their deepest wisdom and compassion  to all beings.  This is the most important point: that we do whatever we possibly can do to care for those who are suffering.  This is difficult, but if we continue to do it throughout our whole lifetime, it will without fail come to fulfillment.  We will realize this huge all-embracing state of mind.  For doing this we have to give rise to a great deep vow.  </p><p class="P2">And the way to look at this great deep vow is that it is like getting on a train for, say, Seattle, or a bus for Seattle.  We choose the best vehicle to go on to get to Seattle.  And once we get on that vehicle, we don’t get off of it; then we will certainly get to Seattle.  This is the bottom line of the way of the bodhisattva.  Even though what we are deciding and vowing to do seems impossible, we get started and just don’t stop.  If it is not like that, it is not the path of the bodhisattva.  </p><p class="P2">Because it says when the bodhisattva follows the wrong way he follows the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha,  it is not saying that following the wrong way means that the bodhisattvas should be doing bad things. Rather, that we should not be stuck on what good we’ve done or the good we are doing.  If we are doing things to look good in society so other people will approve of us, that is not the point of the way of the bodhisattva. </p><p class="P2">In the Bible it is written that when good works are repeated too much they are no longer good works.  And it also says in the bible that the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing.  That is to say, we are not doing these things to alleviate the suffering of others in order to be self-congratulated or congratulated by others.  </p><p class="P3">Vimalakīrti said, “If a bodhisattva traverses the unacceptable paths, this is to penetrate the path of buddhahood.”</p><p class="P1">Nangaku Ejo Zenji and Baso Doitsu</p><p class="P2">When we do zazen it is not so simple to do it well.  We feel tired and sleepy and achy and distracted and scattered.  Baso Doitsu was known as a great teacher.  Nangaku Ejo Zenji was building a dojo in the mountains when he heard about someone there who was known for doing excellent zazen.  And  he decided he had to go see Baso Doitsu, this monk who was doing this wonderful zazen.  </p><p class="P2">Sure enough, when we got there he saw someone sitting zazen with perfect form, all the external appearance of excellent zazen. </p><p class="P2">And so Nangaku Ejo asked him, “For what are you doing this wonderful zazen?”  <br/>To which, Baso Doitsu answered, “Obvious, isn’t it?  To realize satori, to know the Buddha’s state of mind.”  <br/>To this, Nangaku Ejo answered, “Is that so?”  And he sat down, nearby where Baso Doitsu was doing excellent zazen, and he picked up a tile and a stone and he started scraping the tile with the stone.  <br/>And Baso Doitsu said to him, “What are you doing?”  <br/>He said, “Me?  I’m making a mirror.”  <br/>Baso Doitsu said, “You’re what?  You’re making a mirror?  Anyone knows you can’t make a mirror out of a tile by scraping it with a stone.”  <br/>“Is that so?  Well, that physical body that has to pee and poop and eat and sleep, you think that just sitting it down is going to make it into a Buddha?”  <br/>“Well then,” said Baso Doitsu, humbled, “Then what should you do if you want to become a Buddha?”  <br/>To this, Nangaku answered, “Tell me, if you had an ox and you had a cart and you wanted that ox to pull that cart, would you hit the cart or would hit the ox?”  </p><p class="P2">Hearing this, Baso Doitsu understood immediately that it was not his perfectly postured sitting that was going to bring him to the fulfillment of realizing the state of mind of the Buddha.  It was the first time he had seen it this way, that in everything he did, in any posture, in every moment, he had to be continuing the state of mind of zazen.  He finally saw that just to sit with good sitting posture was not the way to awakening, but to sharply cut through everything that is extra in every single moment—that is the way.  We do this until we can forget our body and our thinking completely, then there will, without fail, be a moment when it all falls away.  But we cannot be moved around by anything whatsoever.  And this is the way that Vimalakirti was teaching.</p><p class="P3">Mañjuśrī also asked, “How does the bodhisattva traverse the unacceptable paths?”</p><p class="P3">Vimalakīrti answered, “The bodhisattva practices the five [deeds of] interminable [retribution] without becoming distraught.</p><p class="P2">One of those deeds of interminable retribution is being sick and in great pain.  98% of people in terrible pain can be helped to some extent by pain relief, but there are cases where that is not possible, where there is terrible pain that cannot be relieved, cancer of bone marrow, for example, and this is what is being referred to here.  To be in that situation but to not feel your body at all.  This is possible with deep profound prayer, which is founded on and includes the deepest faith.</p><p class="P2">“Even should he enact these deadly sins, killing the father, killing the mother, killing an arhat, harming a Buddha, breaking up the harmony of the Sangha.”  These words are not to be taken literally. To kill an arhat, for example, means to stop the line of flow of the true wisdom.  And to crush the Sangha’s harmony: this is written about clearly in the Dhammapada and in the Records of Rinzai.</p><p class="P1">Rinzai Zenji on the five heinous crimes</p><p class="P2">Rinzai Zenji has said: To seek the Dharma is to not be attached to any thing to be thankful to. Someone asked, “What is the karma of the five heinous crimes?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “Killing the father, slaying the mother, shedding the blood of a Buddha, destroying the harmony of the sangha, and burning the scriptures and images—this is the karma of the five heinous crimes.”</p><p class="P2">“What is meant by ‘father’?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “Avidya is the father. When the place of arising or extinguishing of a single thought in your mind is not to be found, as with a sound reverberating throughout space, and there is nothing anywhere for you to do—this is called ‘killing the father’.”</p><p class="P2">“What is meant by ‘mother’?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “Covetousness is the mother. When a single thought in your mind enters the world of desire and seeks covetousness, but sees that all dharmas are only empty forms, and [thus] has no attachment anywhere—this is called ‘slaying the mother’.”</p><p class="P2">“What is meant by ‘shedding the blood of a Buddha’?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “When in the midst of the pure dharmadhåtu you haven’t in your mind a single reasoning thought, and [thus] pitch blackness pervades everywhere—this is called ‘shedding the blood of a Buddha’.”</p><p class="P2">“What is meant by ‘destroying the harmony of the sangha’?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “When a single thought in your mind truly realizes that the bonds and enticements of the passions are like space with nothing upon which to depend—this is called ‘destroying the harmony of the sangha’.”</p><p class="P2">“What is meant by ‘burning the scriptures and images’?”</p><p class="P2">The master said, “When you see that causal relations are empty, that mind is empty, and that dharmas are empty, and [thus] your single thought is decisively cut off and, transcendent, you’ve nothing to do—this is called ‘burning the scriptures and images.’</p><p class="P2">In the Records of Rinzai it is written with these especially severe words. In this endless hell with no break, the heaviest sins are these five: to kill your mother, to kill your father, to burn the scriptures and the teachings, to kill the Buddha, to break the harmony of the sangha. These are the five heinous crimes, the worst sins a human can commit and which must not be committed no matter what. From the very primitive times of Buddhism this has been a central teaching. Nevertheless, here Rinzai Zenji has said that only after we commit such sins and cause such karma will we be able to become liberated.</p><p class="P2"> This is the particular and unusual way of teaching in Zen, it must be said. It seems backwards and violent to kill the father, to kill the mother, to kill the Buddha; Rinzai Zenji used the most inflammatory words possible, especially since children in ancient China were taught to hold filial piety above everything else. Filial piety was the most basic and sacred of all moral teachings. In the Dhammapada the Buddha left these very strict words: “the parent kills the child, the child kills the parent, the wife kills the husband the husband kills the wife.” Even the Buddha clearly says these same words, so what is meant by mother and father in this context? What is it actually saying in a psychological sense? That voice of authority which is always putting the pressure on us, sometimes called the father, sometimes the mother, is also called the symbol of the king. Rinzai calls the father the great ignorance, the absence of all light. Deep in our mind we all have root ignorance, that complete absence of light from where all of our desires and extraneous thoughts come forth. We have to cut those roots,  one after the next. Then for the first time our mind is liberated from the suffering of delusion. If we can cut that root, then for the first time we can know that state of mind that is like a clear sky on an autumn day, the sky that extends boundlessly in every direction. Rinzai calls this “to kill the father”. The Buddha is saying, in essence, the exact same thing. In our mind there is deeply embedded an ego filter that holds its power over us, and the Budha is saying we have to cut that.</p><p class="P2"> Rinzai says that the mother is covetousness. No matter how much we have, we want more. We want more of everything and don’t want to lose anything we have. If we can cut this attachment, how much easier our life becomes. Mothers all over the world are praying for the safety of their own child in one straight line. The greediness of that love, expressed by the prayer for safety of only one’s own child—without resolving this our mind will always be attached to something and will never be free. Whether it is the Buddha or the Dharma or the Sangha, if we are attached we make a great mistake.</p><p class="P2">The father is the absence of all light, where there is darkness only, no brightness in our mind at all. This place in our mind is where we have instinctual mind moments coming up one after another, without having any idea of why they are doing so. From each of those mind moments, the many various thoughts are produced and invented, and the base of those thoughts is that dark ignorance. If we do not pierce through that, there is no true liberation, and there can be no liberation for all people. That place of no light whatsoever, the profoundest darkness, that has to be directly experienced, and it has to be cut.</p><p class="P2">The mother is attached and greedy love. To know love is very important, but it cannot be preferential such as only loving our own child, or to use love for satisfying our own personal desires. This is attached love, and the mother here represents that; that mother must be killed.</p><p class="P2">While searching for that pure mind we seek,  we put down others and elevate our own purity, being attached to it—we have to cut this. This is to kill the Arahats.</p><p class="P2">To spill the blood of the Buddha means to discard the idea that we are special, and to stop any worship of a special object called a “Buddha”. This is what makes us defensive, and that is not true freedom.</p><p class="P2"> There is a big difference, however, between honoring something and being attached to it. To be attached means that there is a small self taking a position in it, while to honor it means there is no small self involved. People often confuse these, but in reality they are completely different. In religions, too, there is much confusion because they are not clear on what is being attached to from a small minded ego and what is being honored from a place free from attachment. People who seek the Dharma have to be clear about this for themselves. This is what is being said here.</p><p class="P2">To kill one’s father does not mean to literally kill one’s physical father, but to be able to cut through the great darkness and ignorance, to sweep that away, which is what zazen is for.  That is to kill the father.  To kill the mother is to let go of all of our personal attachments. To kill the thoughts that are constantly arising, this is what is most important.  To kill that attachment to material things that we are always holding onto, but also to be able to be free from the terrible states of mind that keep us from seeing our endowed Buddha nature is the point of all of these.  To always keep our mind pure is the teaching here.</p><p class="P2">To not be moved around by anything, or we can’t know the Dharma.  We  have to be able to do our zazen not just because “today I feel like doing a little bit of zazen,” but because we know that, no matter what, we have to realize this state of mind.  We cannot continue without it.  And for doing zazen in this way, with such deep motivation, Vimalakirti is teaching us here.</p><p class="P3">1. Mañjuśrī then asked Vimalakīrti, “How should the bodhisattva penetrate the path of buddhahood?”<span> </span></p><p class="P3">Vimalakīrti said, “If a bodhisattva traverses the unacceptable paths, this is to penetrate the path of buddhahood.”</p><p class="P3">[Mañjuśrī] also asked, “How does the bodhisattva traverse the unacceptable paths?”</p><p class="P3">[Vimalakīrti] answered, “The bodhisattva practices the five [deeds of] interminable [retribution] without becoming distraught.</p><p class="P2">Manjusri asks Vimalakirti in what way should a Bodhisattva follow the Buddha’s way?  And in this way Vimalakirti answers.  He thought he would say, people should be truthful and industrious and honest.  That is what most people would have expected. But instead Vimalakirti is enlisting these unexpected qualities,  saying that we have to set the root of the truth very deeply.  </p><p class="P2">We also have the words of the Lotus Sutra that teach that a Buddha appears in the world to open the treasury of truth by causing sentient beings to see into it and by causing sentient beings to be able to enter it and abide in it.  To open each person’s clearly seeing eye, which is the same as that seeing eye of the Buddha.  And if we can awaken in that way, then we can create a harmonious society which accepts everyone equally—a  paradise right here. We are not being guided to seek something far away; rather, to create a paradise right where we are.</p><p class="P2">The usual way of perceiving the Buddha’s path is  that we should do those things which make us be able to go to paradise.  But the teaching is different from that.  It is not to try to make a paradise; rather, it is to let go of that ego that makes wherever we are not a paradise.  To not divide the world because of something called a Buddhist path.  </p><p class="P2">Part of what needs to be set aside and put down is that there is a “highest” and a “lowest” level of society;  and the Mahayana and the Theravadan are one and the same in not thinking that there is something which is higher or lower.  Not to assign people some kind of rank order with regard to their state of mind; rather to do the practice in such a way that it can be done by everyone.  </p><p class="P2">If we can see the whole picture, we won’t get caught on the idea of appreciating people only for what they do, which will strengthen their ego.  Strengthening the ego is not the point.  Increasing the ego is not the point, because from the origin there was no ego.  It was not the ego that involved beings in the survival of the fittest, it was preservation of the species and the motivation of the various beings.  How important it is to let go of our preferences in order for the truth to be kept alive.  To really work with the ego in this way.  Only humans’ egos are invested in keeping something else alive.  To keep the truth alive, it has to be through great deep efforts to keep it alive.  Or else it will just extinguish the whole species.  </p><p class="P2">In recent human history we have the era of the great sages about 2500 years ago, with the emergence of the great wisdom of Socrates and Christ, Confucious, and the Buddha.  And from there the Buddha’s path was also created.  When we look at the history, we see that the world selfishly just continuing would not have been able to survive.  It may have seemed, along the way, that there were many who failed, but that view is not the point.  Rather it is for everyone to be seen as their Buddha nature, no exceptions.  </p><p class="P2">In this struggle for survival, humans’ evolution continued to the place where a state of mind, which could realize the wisdom of including all beings into it, became possible.  This was not just a conceptual idea about all beings being included.  It was the wisdom of realizing and seeing this.  To not be afraid of devils and bad qualities, but to see all through this.  </p><p class="P2">There is a story about parents who sent their daughter to study so that she could find someone of high class to marry.  And when they asked when she came back from school what she had learned, she said they told her she should not bother with filial piety.  And the parents were very upset.  They sent her to school to become the best possible wife, and here she was being told not to honor her parents.  </p><p class="P2">So they went to the teacher and complained, saying why are they teaching our daughter, in her ethics course, that she should not respect and look highly at her parents.  And the teacher replied, “I didn’t teach her that she shouldn’t feel filial piety.  What I taught her was she shouldn’t be absorbed in whether or not she had filial piety, be conceited about the fact and be self-consciously aware that what she was doing was being filially pious, when having those emotions for her parents and ways of taking care of them should be done naturally without an idea of being a child who was filially pious.</p><p class="P3">[Vimalakīrti] answered, “The bodhisattva practices the five [deeds of] interminable [retribution] without becoming distraught.</p><p class="P3">“He goes to the hells without the defilements of transgression; goes among the animals without the errors of ignorance, conceit, and so on.</p><p class="P2">Places such as prisons where people are put who behave in very negative ways.  There was a priest, named Kitano Gyokai, who wanted to teach people of this state of mind, so he got himself thrown into prison and there he taught the people who had been put into that prison the Lotus Sutra.  And he would always tell the people who were in prison that they were in prison because, while having this Buddha nature they had all forgotten about it and so they had all been put into prison so they could learn about it again.  He told them to think of their loved ones and to remember them deeply.  He went over the whole Lotus Sutra again and again, doing it by every single line.  These prisoners would be freed because their term was over, but soon they would end up again in the same prison.  The priest would very patiently cultivate their deeper state of mind.</p><p class="P3">“He goes to the hells without the defilements of transgression; goes among the animals without the errors of ignorance, conceit, and so on. </p><p class="P2">This year (2011), on March 11 at 2:46 in the afternoon, there was a huge earthquake of  9.3 magnitude and a tsunami (tidal wave) of 38 meters that hit in Japan. Coming to see this destruction, we cannot imagine what we will experience when it enters our eyes through a flat media such as in newspapers or to see it in some way that is not three dimensional.  </p><p class="P2">To go visit it himself, which the Roshi did, to see the huge pine trees, those huge, huge old pine trees that are all twisted hideously in the same direction and all laid down flat.  The huge power of the water that was 38 stories high.  The 7,000 ton ship that was found on the third floor of a building.  And in that tragedy, 28,000 people were killed.  This was a true hell.  Those who had no way to protect and provide for themselves were like hungry ghosts.  And those who lost everything, everything, could only wonder “why am I still here?”  </p><p class="P2">Yet not one person in this situation was found stealing or looting.  People of that area in Japan are known to be bottom line good and honest people with strong integrity.  They used the tool of their wisdom—and from there further wisdom was born—to take care of themselves and others.  Not only is it a personal wisdom, but one that brings together what is possible for all people.  Vimalakirti is saying that the true mind can be most realized, must be most realized, in the most difficult circumstances.  And then we can know this truth: the way of the Buddha’s path from living it in actualization.</p><p class="P3"> “He goes among the hungry ghosts replete in merit; traverses the paths of the form and formless realms without considering himself superior. </p><p class="P3">“He manifests acting out of desire but transcends the defiled attachments; manifests acting out of anger at sentient beings but is without aversion.</p><p class="P2">Greed, desire and ignorance are here and no light is there.  It is a given that our body longs to live, to stay alive.  And it is in the nature of our being alive  that we want to eat food and drink water to continue to exist. This is our basic modus operandi, but because of it we can become, if we center on our personal needs, very greedy.  </p><p class="P2">Life energy is such that we want to hold on to it tight.  We want to be able to eat to prevent ourselves from dying.  And so, of course, our body responds that way.  When we don’t have enough food we get irritable, we get angry, we get egoistically irritated.  We get upset at the people who are nearby us, and especially if we are people who have had a lot, we get angry that we don’t have the same amount anymore.  And to bear this kind of situation we get greedy and moved around.  To not get angry in such a situation, to not be moved around by that greediness, to not be in the clutches of and the slave to that situation—this is the way to use this kind of challenge for truly developing our deepest wisdom.  </p><p class="P2">As it says in Christianity, do not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.  In another angle on this, to not show when we are doing something beneficial, to not be doing it from the point of view that we want to get approval, we want someone to think we are special because we are doing something good.  And this is a very important practice in the Buddha’s way.  If we do something for people, if we do something at all, and we are doing it to be praised and gain approval, that it is not one of the ways of walking the Buddha’s way.  To not care if we are acknowledged or not, or if anyone is even noticing it; if we can’t see through it in this way it is not the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">“He manifests acting out of stupidity but uses wisdom to control his mind.</p><p class="P2">Some people always have to save whatever they get, even if it’s their used chopsticks from a meal on the airplane.  The salt and pepper and chopsticks, tying them up, taking them home, never using them.  Or if it is a little piece of string or ribbon and wrapping paper, never throwing them out, but gathering them in case some day they might be of some use.  We may need all of these things at sometime, we never know.  And there are positive points to this.  There might actually be a time when something like this could be necessary.  </p><p class="P3">“He manifests acting out of lust but forsakes both internal and external and does not begrudge his own life; manifests the practicing of moral infractions but peacefully resides in the pure precepts, even unto harboring great fear about even minor transgressions; </p><p class="P2">We have the koan, “The pure person of training does not go into heaven.  The badly behaved bhikkhu does not fall into hell.”   In this koan [from Entangling Vines, case #24],  we realize directly the quality of emptiness.  If a person of training goes against the precepts, they do not fall into hell.  Sometimes there are reasons.  We may find ourselves in terribly disabling and challenging circumstances, but without making a show of it, even in those circumstances we keep our practice alive, tenaciously.  We watch each footstep carefully and are not moved around by the difficult circumstances.</p><p class="P3">[He] manifests acting out of anger but is always sympathetically forbearant; manifests acting out of laziness, yet vigorously cultivates merit; manifests acting out of a disturbed mind, yet is always mindfully concentrated; manifests acting out of stupidity, yet penetrates both mundane and supramundane wisdom.</p><p class="P1">Yamada Taijun</p><p class="P2">Mumon Roshi had a person in his family, 120 years ago, who was named Yamada Taijun.  Yamada Taijun was famous.  He was famous for being so very careful that even though he had candles, he had them, but he refused to light them even when the night time came.  And then if someone came into his entranceway to visit, he would take out two stones, two flint stones, rub them together, make a tiny spark, so the person coming to visit could see that the host was in and could crawl up into the room where they would talk in the dark.  And then when it was time for the guest to go home, he would rub the flint stones together again, so that they would have a small spark to see where they had left their zori.  </p><p class="P2">A sarcastic young person from the neighborhood came to see him in the evening time, and when Yamada Taijun went to rub the flint stones together, he said, “No, no, no, don’t do that, you’ll wear out your stones.”  And when the young man was finished talking to Yamada Taijun, Yamada Taijun went to rub the flint stones, and he said, “No, no, no, don’t do that, you’ll wear out your stones, and I already put my zori into my belt, so I don’t need the light to find them.”  And at this, Yamada Taijun got annoyed and said, “You put your zori into your belt?  Well, that’s even worse.  You’re going to get my tatami all dirty, and I’ll wear out my broom sweeping up the dirt.”  </p><p class="P2">Okay, so he has this quality which is extreme. But it was at this very same time that the famine of the Tenpo era occurred.  Because there was no food and no way for people to make money or grow the food at that time, this relative of Mumon Roshi’s, Yamada Taijun, gave every single penny he had saved from being so careful and fastidious with his use of money, to help people.  To have kept it for this time when it was really necessary!  And because of this man’s great effort and way of being, there is a building commemorating Yamada Taijun in the town where Mumon Roshi was raised.  In this way, also, we can see our way of practice.</p><p class="P3">“He manifests acting out of the afflictions, yet is always pure in mind; manifests becoming a Māra, yet accords with the wisdom of the Buddha and follows no other teaching; manifests becoming a śrāvaka, yet for sentient beings explains Dharmas they have not heard before; manifests becoming a pratyekabuddha, yet accomplishes great compassion to teach sentient beings; manifests becoming destitute, yet has the unlimited merit of the ‘hand of treasures’; manifests becoming maimed through criminal punishment, yet adorns himself with all the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks; manifests becoming low-born, yet is [actually] born within the Buddha’s lineage and replete in its various merits; manifests becoming feeble and ugly, yet attains the body of a Nārāyaṇa, which all sentient beings enjoy seeing.</p><p class="P1">Obaku checks Rinzai</p><p class="P2">We have the story in the Records of Rinzai about Master Obaku, who was doing a check of the zendo by walking by the raised platforms where the monks sit.  When he walked by Rinzai, Rinzai appeared to be deeply sleeping as he was doing zazen.  And Obaku walked very carefully, saying nothing, tiptoeing past Rinzai, as he kept sleeping.  </p><p class="P2">And then when he got to where the head monk was, the head monk was sitting strong and tautly with his eyes wide open.  Obaku said to the head monk, “Stop having so many extraneous thoughts,” to which the head monk told him to be quiet.  When Obaku left the zendo, Rinzai followed him and apologized to him for sleeping in the zendo earlier, to which Obaku didn’t answer.  </p><p class="P3">“He manifests becoming old and sick, yet always eradicates the roots of illness and transcends the fear of death.</p><p class="P2">Also in the Records of Rinzai is written how Rinzai was doing samu; Obaku came along and Rinzai stopped what he was doing and rested his chin on the handle of his hoe. He just stood there. His teacher came, so he stopped working. Usually people would start working as hard as they could when their teacher shows up, but Rinzai was different. He had just been working hard, but when his teacher showed up, he stopped suddenly, rested, and looked in the other direction. Obaku saw that and asked him if he was tired, saying he looked really out of it. Rinzai replied, “I just arrived and have not used my hoe at all, why should I be tired?” As Rinzai was just leaning on his hoe, Obaku picked up the hoe and he said, “Is there anyone who can use this?”  to which Rinzai answered, “I can use that.”  In that way, they were talking not about the use of physical tools, but about the way of seeing and being with the Dharma. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti is showing us not to be caught on the conditioned way of seeing our behavior in the usual context or following precepts in that usual context, but to see that when there are those in pain who are suffering, to experience that in an empathetic way and not be caught on protecting and guarding our own small individual way of being. Rather, to use our awareness for the larger picture, for dealing with all people’s suffering and liberation.</p><p class="P3">“He manifests having the material requisites, yet always views [the world as] impermanent and is truly without desire; manifests having wife, concubines, and mistresses, yet always distantly transcends the muddy filth of the five desires; manifests dumbness (i.e., muteness), yet accomplishes eloquence and unfailing dhāraṇīs.</p><p class="P2">Of course, to walk the Buddha’s way there have been taught fifty-eight basics, for example.  The Buddha spoke clearly of these in the Flower Garland Sutra, the first sutra, but nobody could get it because his wisdom was so huge.  </p><p class="P2">The Buddha had been educated both philosophically and academically as a youth, but he realized that his understanding was not sufficient, so he left behind everything and went off to somehow liberate all humankind.  This humankind, which is always fighting among itself, living in deep suffering and conflict.  He had to resolve this somehow.  He ended up having to do training and leave behind his lovely wife, his adored son, Rahula, his whole family, his castle, his whole country. And he did this for all people, all humankind.  He ended up going to training, and finally was able to encounter two hermits who taught him that it was our thinking that was the problem. Clarifying that was the way to human’s truest joy.  </p><p class="P2">But the Buddha saw clearly that that would only go so far.  It might provide the solution for our own personal joy and realization.  That might be a good solution for us if it was only to make our own selves happy and satisfied, but there was no motivation, then, for liberating all beings.  The Buddha’s goal clearly was to liberate all beings.  He was already personally blessed with a country, a palace, a family.  Nothing missing, except that he knew he had to cut away that ego attachment to be able to bring true liberation to all people.  </p><p class="P2">He did the most basic walking to discover what was there before the ego.  He did this for six years.  Then he came down from that mountain, washed his body, and sat down in the state of mind of no self and no other and no speck of anything.  But even if humans negate all desires, if we don’t give life to a new birth, a human regeneration, we’ll be stopped at only negating.  </p><p class="P2">It was on the 8th day of December, when he was thirty five years old, that the Buddha, holding onto nothing at all, with no more ego clutching, became that morning star, humans’ truth and the path to awakening.  If we follow that path as well, while being still full of greed, anger and ignorance, we will learn how to let it go and realize a new birth.  And this is where the path is of such great importance.  Because we walk it we can know that place prior to being caught on the human rules of society that are based on ego.  That actuality of humans’ truth is what is real.  As Vimalakirti taught, it is to be attached to nothing at all.</p><p class="P2">The Buddha realized deeply, and wrote the Kegon Sutra, this Flower Garland Sutra, but since no one could understood it, he wrote the Agon Sutra, in which  he put it very simply for anybody to be able to understand. In it he said to not make our minds murky, to not do bad things and to do good things.  And then to bring our mind into clarity.  </p><p class="P2">He taught the precepts, necessary guidelines for people in society, and with those we learn how to live and walk the path.  Teaching us how to do this was then further elaborated in other sutras.  How could we use the path that the Buddha had taught?  One of the examples of what was taught is in the Song of Enlightenment, written by Yoka Genkaku Zenji, a disciple of the 6th Patriarch.  </p><p class="P3">“He manifests becoming a ‘false ford’ (i.e., a heretic), yet uses the correct ford to ‘cross over’ sentient beings [to salvation].</p><p class="P1">Yoka Genkaku Zenji</p><p class="P2">Yoka Genkaku Zenji had not been formally trained, but he had deeply understood.  And as he was pilgrimaging he had met Taiyo Gensaku Zenji, who was a disciple of the Sixth Patriarch.  When they met and they talked, it was clear to Taiyo Gensaku Zenji that Yoka Genkaku Zenji had a very deep understanding, and he asked with whom had he been training.  And to this, Yoka Genkaku Zenji answered, “I have no formal teacher, but I am learning from studying the Vimalakirti sutra.”  When Taiyo Gensaku was told about his not having a teacher, he told him he should go see the Sixth Patriarch.  Taiyo Gensaku went ahead to the Sixth Patriarch and told him about Yoka Genkaku so that Yoka Genkaku was able to meet the Sixth Patriarch.  And after only one night of spending time together, he became his successor.  </p><p class="P2">The Song of Englightenment: “Have you not seen the idle person of Tao?  Who has nothing to learn and nothing to do?  Who neither discards wondering thoughts nor seeks the truth….”</p><p class="P2"> The real nature of ignorance is Buddha nature.  The illusory empty body is the Dharma body.  Can you understand this?  It is not about mentally understanding something, it is about realizing the Buddha’s way, not by only training in some ascetic way.  As the Buddha had said himself the instant he was awakened, “How wondrous, how wondrous!  All beings without exception are endowed with this same great bright clear mind to which I have just awakened.  Only because of our attached and extraneous thinking we are not able to realize this and see it clearly.”  </p><p class="P2">He realized it was not by ascetic training that he had received this clear mind—that he had always been endowed with it but it had been covered over with attached ideas and ego clutter, seeking one’s own greatest benefit.  Rather, to see, simply see with the eyes, to hear with the ears, to smell with the nose, to taste with the mouth—we receive this world exactly as it is and we see that there is no such thing as an ego anywhere.  Actually, we’ve only invented it.  </p><p class="P3">“He manifests entering all the destinies, yet eradicates their causes and conditions; and manifests nirvana, yet does not eradicate samsara.</p><p class="P2">From the origin, from our birth, there was no such thing that ever existed.  It is only  phenomena.  There is no good and bad anything in this world as it is.  We can smell because there is a flower, which has a fragrance.  We can hear because sounds are.  Each sense has its own function.  Our mind is never limited and we all have this.  With it we can all do infinite functioning.  Neither discard wondering thoughts nor seek the truth; not to hold on to a small minded view of, “you can’t do this, you can’t do that;”  But to live from a greater, more spacious mind.  Of course, there are moments of greed, anger, ignorance, but they have no roots.  They always always fade.  We have no need to be afraid of that which will fade.</p><p class="P2">We are living in this world that is always in constant flux.  And within that, we just think that we are living as a separate individual.  Every minute we are metabolizing, and if we do not get caught on those busy activities of mind, we will see that we have, from the origin, an empty mind.  We can always see clearly in one single moment.  </p><p class="P2">One moment is the basic common denominator for all experiences and all perceptions.  We hear in one instant, and this is our truest nature.  But we add on complicated thinking, and with thoughts mixed in we can’t see or hear clearly.  It is zazen that straightens this out.  Each instant we perceive clearly, that is zazen.  </p><p class="P2">Seeing deeply that life energy in each and every moment.  The mountain flowers, they are like a brocade—those flowers that have been falling from the trees and landing on the ground to make a full brocade; the rivers flowing, a brimming stream of indigo.  And if we see this, we can see how actually we are stuck on nothing.</p><p class="P3">“Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva can traverse the unacceptable paths in this way, this is to penetrate the path of buddhahood.”</p><p class="P2">Here, we have Vimalakirti offering many many versions of how to live in society without being pulled around by the many things that can push and pull us.  The examples are numberless, but what he is saying here is this: that the mind of this one moment has no clutter in it, and to not become that state of mind where clutter gathers.  </p><p class="P1">Nakamura Hisako</p><p class="P2">Once, Roshi had the opportunity to meet a woman named Nakamura Hisako.  She grew up in Takayama, in Gifu prefecture. She died at seventy-six.  While she was born a normal healthy child, at age four she had severe frostbite which  caused her hands and feet to become gangrenous,  and she had to have them all amputated.  Shortly after that her father died. And her mother, who had been a seamstress, could not keep their house because she couldn’t afford things without the salary of her husband.  </p><p class="P2">Because of their great lack of money, they had no house and were allowed to live in someone’s garage area, but because Hisako would cry out loudly every night because her sickness hurt so badly, they were asked to leave that place, as well.  Her mother didn’t know what she would possibly be able to do to support herself and her daughter.  </p><p class="P2">And so she decided that together they would commit suicide.  They went to the Miyagawa river, a source river in Takayama.  But somehow, even though Hisako was very young, she understood what her mother was about to do.  She pounded her mother’s shoulder and said, “Hisako doesn’t want to die!  Hisako doesn’t want to die!  Stop!”  And so, because her mother hadn’t really wanted to die herself but feared for her daughter’s life in this desperate terrible situation, she stopped that idea and took them back to town.  </p><p class="P2">Soon after that, there was another karmic opportunity, and they had a new home.  Her mother had a new husband.  There were two other children.  These two children who were slightly older than her, bullied Hisako terribly because she couldn’t eat with chopsticks because her hands had been amputated.  </p><p class="P2">She was very determined though, and she had her arms bandaged so that in her bandaged stumps she could hold chopsticks, and she eventually learned to eat with them.  But she still couldn’t eat like a normal child, so they would say, “Hisako, she eats like an animal, like a cat.”  And the neighborhood children from outside would come just to watch her like some freak.  </p><p class="P2">Her mother went out to try to make some money by doing seamstress work.  And during that time, Hisako learned to write kanji, holding a brush with her mouth.  And with her bandaged hand, the hardened hand stumps, she would hold a needle and practice sewing.  </p><p class="P2">In her sewing practice she made many small fabric toys so that she could give them to the children of the neighborhood, but the children would all say, “Hisako does her sewing holding things with her mouth, so they all have drool all over them.”  So the children would not receive her homemade gifts.  Having heard this, Hisako worked harder to be able to make gifts that she was sure had no drool on them.  And she continued working in every way, making great efforts.  Finally, she became the age of a young woman who would be able to find a husband.</p><p class="P2">Takayama is a very cold town up in the Japanese Alps, and because Hisako was going to have to someday take care of herself, her mother was very very severe with her.  Hisako wanted her mother to light the kotatsu heater, but her mother said, No, she had to do it herself.  This is a very difficult job, even for someone with hands.  To do this required Hisako to light a match with her mouth and make a fire of small kindling, which would then light a kind of artificial charcoal.  Again and again, she tried to light the match with her mouth, but again and again her breath would blow out the match’s flame.  </p><p class="P2">Her mother refused to do her daughter’s laundry.  She told her she had to learn to do it herself, and there were no such things as washing machines in those days.  There wasn’t even a sink and a faucet.  She had to go to the pump and pump up her own water with her hand stumps and with her shoulders, get it into the bucket and wash the laundry.  It wasn’t such a convenient era at that time.  And she would clean her own room.  </p><p class="P2">Finally, at age sixteen, when her mother and her grandparents had died, there was only her brother and her sister left.  She knew that if she lived with them, their prospects for marriage would be poor because they had a sister who was so handicapped.  People would be afraid if they married into that household, their babies would become handicapped as well.  So Hisako knew that she had to somehow leave that household for the sake of her brother and sister.  </p><p class="P2">A man came by and said to her, “How long are you going to stay there and cause trouble for that household?” To this, Hisako said, “I don’t want to be here causing trouble for this household, but I have no choice.”  So the man said to her, “Will you join my circus?”  She had always wanted to avoid that, if at all possible, but after she thought about it awhile, she knew that she had no choice, and she went into his circus.  She was billed as a handicapped Daruma girl who could be looked at like a freak, someone who could sew and someone who could clean.  </p><p class="P2">She traveled with the circus from the north of Japan to the south of Japan, and when everyone else was enjoying their free time, she would save every single penny and buy books, studying in every moment possible.  Learning to write poetry, learning to write calligraphy with a brush in her mouth.  In every free moment she studied.  </p><p class="P2">When the circus was in one town, a young man came up to her and asked, didn’t she want to learn real calligraphy?  She had been doing it in her very own free style.  And she said, of course she did. So a famous calligrapher, Otsuki Geisho, who was nearby in Nagoya, took her on as a student, welcomed her to spend time with him, and taught her calligraphy.  The Roshi has one of her scrolls on which it is written, “Mu ichi motsu,” one piece of emptiness.  And it is signed by Hisako, seventy-two years old.  She became very famous for her calligraphy.</p><p class="P2">Helen Keller came to Japan twice, and they wanted someone—who would be the best person, they were thinking—for Helen Keller to spend time with.  And so, of course, they thought of Hisako.  By then she was a famous speaker and educator.  From her many lessons of life, she would speak to different groups in Japan.  Helen Keller was also giving talks, and Hisako was chosen to be her companion while she was in Japan.  </p><p class="P2">What could she make as a gift for Helen Keller, she wondered.  She made a doll, sewing all of its clothes, making tabi for the doll, tabi that Hisako herself had never been able to wear because she had no feet.  She took her homemade doll and was about to walk on stage to present it to Helen Keller when she saw that there was a big, beautiful Japanese doll that had been given by the department store, and she was holding her very sad looking homemade doll.  But as she was struggling with the idea of whether to give the doll to Helen Keller or not, the people told her to hurry up and get on the stage.  She was wearing artificial legs and hands by then.  </p><p class="P2">Helen Keller hugged Hisako and felt her arms and legs and told her that, in fact, it was not she, Helen Keller, who was the miracle person; it was Hisako.  She was so thrilled that all she could think about was how thankful she was that at that age of four there had been no suicide.  And the two of them shared the time, when Helen Keller came twice to Japan; both of those visits she spent them with Hisako.</p><p class="P2">Hisako wrote many many poems.  “No hands, no feet, this body is embraced in the Buddha’s long sleeves so comfortably.”   Wanting to gassho on the day of the memorial for her mother.  Wanting to gassho, on the day of the memorial for her father.  But she could not gassho with no hands to raise– “that gesture which repents all of our misdeeds, how sad that I cannot put hands together.”</p><p class="P2">In front of her parents’ altar she wanted to gassho, to put her palms together, but she could not; and she cried there, to have two fine hands.  There are many who do not know to put them together in gassho, Hisako’s today, every day was full of gratitude and bowing. In the past she talked about grace and how she had been full of gratitude. It moved the roshi to tears. “With nothing at all, not even hands or feet, already Buddha.”</p><p class="P4">Everyone ‘s grace, <br/>Thanks to that, there is a today</p><p class="P4">And I am thankful from the bottom of my heart, </p><p class="P4">For everything that has ever happened to me </p><p class="P4">I am very thankful.</p><p class="P2">If we are born with all of our limbs, if we do not have gratitude, then there is nothing more debilitating than that. This is what it means to be endowed with a splendid mind but never awakened to that Mind within.  Here is an example of the opposite, to appear so unfortunate but to live with a truly awakened state of mind.</p><p class="P2">There was a special television show by NHK, the national broadcasting system of Japan, telling about her.  In this television show she spoke about her life and about her struggle and about her deep state of mind, saying, “In this world, everything is thanks to everyone.  My mother, who seemed like a demon, it was thanks to her that I was able to stay alive and be here.  That I am alive today and survive today, this is because of her strictness.  That circus master, who seemed so terrible, but only because of what I learned while I was in the circus am I able to be in the state of mind that I am in today.  Every single thing we are and have is thanks to everyone, everywhere.”  </p><p class="P2">Mumon Roshi met with Hisako several times, and they would write letters to each other.  Everybody else’s letters Mumon Roshi would give to his attendant or someone to take out and put in the mail for him.  But her letters he would always, always handle himself.  And when writing her address, he would address her as a very rare person.</p><p class="P2">One time when our Roshi was acting as Mumon Roshi’s attendant, and she came to visit, he was the one preparing the food and he asked Mumon Roshi how he should prepare, with what kind of dishes and utensils, and he was told, “just in the usual way”.  He couldn’t imagine how this was going to be possible.  He was wondering how she could possibly eat this meal and these usual dishes. He put them out as he was asked, the regular rice bowl and soup bowl.  </p><p class="P2">He said watching it was like a magic show.  She would hold her rice bowl in the crook of her elbow and with her chopsticks held in her stump’s bandages, she would eat from the elbow completely naturally and normally.  It was like you couldn’t believe this was even a possibility, yet it was being done as if it was how it is done and has been done everyday.  His eyes were popping out.  It was as if he was seeing into a different dimension.  He said, it truly is as Vimalakirti says, “It’s not about form, it’s about mind. We cannot be fooled about this.  It’s about how deep, about how huge this mind is.”  </p><p class="P2">No matter what difficult challenge a bodhisattva finds himself confronted by, to not move away from that is the way of the bodhisattva.  Nothing to dislike, no matter what it is.  If we’re asked to do it or it comes to us, say, “I can do that.”  Make our mind up, with firm determination.  </p><p class="P2">When our mind becomes set in one direction, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.  To decide to do it, no matter what, and then to realize that this is the one way to accomplish it.  And to walk in that way is this path.</p><p class="P2">There is a song, a poem, from old times: “I want this.  I want that.  There are things I want all over the place.  Looking up, there are more things I want. They are ongoing and never stopping.  But looking down when I am watching my own footsteps, then there is no place for there to be anything I want.”</p><p class="P1">The Boddhisattva Vows</p><p class="P3">Sentient beings  are numberless: I vow to liberate them. <br/>Desires are inexhaustible: I vow to put an end to them.<br/>The Dharmas are boundless: I vow to master them.<br/>The Buddha’s way is unsurpassable: I vow to become it.</p><p class="P2">What is the way of the Buddha, as it is expressed in the first line of the four vows that we recite  every day?  The Buddha’s way.  People all have a way they want to use their life.  How they vow to live their own particular vow and that vow which connects to all beings.  How they decide to use this life, to express this vow, to fulfill it. For this we have these four vows.  </p><p class="P2">We are seven billion people on this planet right now.  We have to cooperate to help each other as our resources begin to dry up and our problems of supporting all human kind become ever more challenging.  And in the coming ten years, the number will explode further.  There will be huge conflicts over resources, and we will need to use these very four vows and polish our deepest wisdom for all in society.  This will be necessary, or extreme disasters will occur among people.  We have to look at these vows seriously and at what they mean for how we live.  This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us in this chapter.</p><p class="P2">Manjusri is asking Vimalakirti, “What is the way of the bodhisattva?”</p><p class="P3">Then the crowned prince Manjusri said to the Licchavi Vimalakirti, “Noble, sir, how does the bodhisattva follow the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha?”</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti replied, “Manjusri, when the bodhisattva follows the wrong way, he follows the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha.”</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti says it cannot be done by trying to look good in some prescribed way.  He is not saying to not do good things, but to not try to look good as you do things, as if you are doing such good things and performing important good deeds.  Thinking of ourselves and trying to appear as someone who is being a good person.  To not be deceived by that behavior which is full of ego! Rather, to offer and give everything by throwing ourselves into society. This is how true liberation takes place. </p><p class="P2">In this way Vimalakirti says that we cannot simply walk a conceptual path on some kind of already set up rails.  We have to let go of even that idea and offer everything to liberating all beings, or there will be no liberation.  To not have our mind moved around at all.  And then for the first time we can become one with the Buddha’s way.   </p><p class="P2">Master Rinzai put it like this: “Not to stop at things that we don’t like and be caught on ideas of preferences and opinions, rather to throw everything into all beings’ liberation.”  That way of becoming a person in whom there is not a trace of the small self, only a reflection in a mirror.  Yet a warm caring mind is still present.  Without that ego, we can reflect each person accurately and simultaneously function appropriately.</p><p class="P2">Next we have Vimalakirti asking Manjusri, “What is the ‘family of the Tatagathas’?”  What are the seeds that must be planted to bring forth that way of living the path of the Buddha?  </p><p class="P3">2. At this Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī, “What is the seed of the Tathāgata?”</p><p class="P3">Mañjuśrī said, “The possession of a body constitutes this seed. <br/>Ignorance and affection constitute this seed. <br/>Lust, anger, and stupidity constitute this seed. <br/>The four confusions constitute this seed. <br/>The five hindrances constitute this seed. <br/>The six entrances (ayatanas) constitute this seed. <br/>The seven loci of consciousness constitute this seed. <br/>The eight heterodox dharmas and nine loci of affliction constitute this seed. <br/>The ten evil actions constitute this seed. <br/>In essence, the sixty-two mistaken views and all the afflictions constitute this seed.”</p><p class="P1">Sixth Patriarch’s poem</p><p class="P2">We have the poems of the Sixth Patriarch and Jinshu Joza.  First we have the poem of Jinshu Joza, where he writes on the wall at the place of the fifth Patriarch: </p><p class="P4">Our body is the Bodhi tree</p><p class="P4">Our mind the mirror bright</p><p class="P4">Carefully we wipe them, hour by hour, </p><p class="P4">And let no dust alight.</p><p class="P2">Reading this, Hui Neng, the sixth Patriarch to be, commented that this is not a poem from the state of mind of one who has truly broken through.  And in response to that poem the sixth Patriarch to be wrote, </p><p class="P4">There is no Bodhi tree,<br/>nor stand of a mirror bright.</p><p class="P4">Since all is void,<br/>where can the dust alight?  </p><p class="P2">That which is expressed in the first poem is only half-way there, the sixth Patriarch said.  He has seen through it.  When Jinshu Joza said conceptually that this body is like a tree, when it says our mind is like a clear mirror, he is already bringing in a concept of how something like our body should be when actually, from the origin, we are empty.  And this idea that we should go around polishing: that is not the deepest of truths.</p><p class="P2">In the Theravadin, the body is considered to be a vessel of our mistaken behavior such that we would kill and steal and be violent.  And our mouth, which is considered to be an instrument of four ways of mistaken behavior: to lie, to be hypocritical, to speak in a flattering way, or to speak badly about others.  These sins of our body and mouth are thought to make us, to lead us, to have to do ascetic training.  But Vimalakirti says, “How are we seeds of Buddhas already?”  </p><p class="P2">This is not about only our body, but because we have a body we can offer it to society.  Even if we don’t have material offerings, with this body we can still offer a kind expression, a smile, a kind word, a kind thought, offer our seat.  In all of these ways we can offer this great deep warm feeling we have from our compassionate mind.  Down to the last very moment, we can give something which is not material.  There are important details for constructing a world, the Buddha land, and these ways of doing it without any material offerings are very important for that.  While every mind moment is of course empty, we simultaneously can offer love, not in order to receive love back, but from this warm state of mind, to live in a way that would liberate all beings.  </p><p class="P2">Next he says that greed, anger and ignorance are also seeds of becoming Buddha.  Not a conceptualization about a way of letting go of these: rather all of our selves deeply want to survive, deeply want to live, to be alive.  To be greedy sounds bad, but we are all greedy to stay alive, right down to our cells.  Our anger is also a positive thing when we’re angry at appropriate things—things that need correction.  If it is handled in a skillful way, then anger can also be a seed of Buddha. </p><p class="P2">Because there is love, that is why wisdom is born.   It is even said that love and wisdom are one.  It cannot be a small self-centered love, however.  It has to be a love that encompasses all beings.  It has to not be something that is used in an unskillful way.  Mañjuśrī continues,</p><p class="P3">Ignorance and affection constitute this seed. Lust, anger, and stupidity constitute this seed. The four confusions constitute this seed. The five hindrances constitute this seed.</p><p class="P2">In this way he continues telling about the seeds of becoming a Buddha. There are the four misapprehensions, looking at things upside down while thinking we are seeing things correctly.  </p><p class="P2">It is true that everything in this world is transient.  There is nothing that will never change.  All things are transient no matter how much we long to hold onto them.  We have to see this.  We cannot ignore the fact that all of this changes, but we do want to hold on to our youth, our health, our possessions. But things are always transforming, so we just have to see that we will, without fail, have to let go of all of it.  </p><p class="P2">We may think something is perfect, but we have to acknowledge that everything changes.  What we have received will have to be given back.  That is why we offer everything to all beings.  We live in the world which appears not to be pure, but to not settle for that, to not sit down on pleasure, but to always let go of things as they are finished.  This is how to live in the way of the Buddha. </p><p class="P2">These four misapprehensions, to see them clearly by remembering that everything in this world is like a bubble—it’s a fleeting world.  “A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream.”  To see this in every situation, but also to see how even all of these things are changing.  We cannot become the seeds of Buddha by trying to hold onto these things and prevent these changes.  Instead, to deeply see how everything is transient. And then to go beyond the world’s transiency, that world where we are aware of its always changing,  and realize the deepest joy within no matter what we are doing.  To see clearly who is the true master in each of these situations.  In this way, our seeds of Buddha will become Buddha; we’ll become true teachers.  We get confused thinking that it is a clear pure world but knowing that it is not. To bring our fullest wisdom to that is what we have to do.</p><p class="P3">The five hindrances constitute this seed. The six entrances (āyatanas) constitute this seed. The seven loci of consciousness constitute this seed. The eight heterodox dharmas and nine loci of affliction constitute this seed. The ten evil actions constitute this seed.</p><p class="P2">We have here remaining the five obstacles, the six media of sense, the seven abodes of consciousness, the eight false paths, the nine causes of irritation, the ten sins. But it cannot be a small wisdom with which we consider these things.  It has to be a great wisdom that vows to liberate all beings from these, and not for our own small self.  </p><p class="P2">As it is said, “If we are a good person, then we will naturally purify.”  However, as Master Shingon has said, “An evil person is one who must especially bring the purification into actuality to become a Buddha.  In essence, if we think we are a good person, we are confused,  thinking that what we are doing is something special and something excellent.  To acknowledge our mistakes is what brings us the impulse and motivation to really consider and access true wisdom.  If we think we are already good, then there is no strong motivation, no strong chi, and no strong wisdom.  And for this reason, we have to see that we are not some kind of formulated good person but are needing to deepen and polish this wisdom always.</p><p class="P3">In essence, the sixty-two mistaken views and all the afflictions constitute this seed.</p><p class="P2">Manjusri concludes his reply to Vimalakirti: “In short, Noble Sir, the sixty-two kinds of convictions constitute the family of the tathagathas”, saying that it is our desires that is our path for realizing the truth.  </p><p class="P2">To this, Vimalakirti answers by pressing him: </p><p class="P3">3. “Why is this?”</p><p class="P3">Mañjuśrī answered, “Anyone who sees the unconditioned and enters the primary status [of Hinayana enlightenment] will be unable to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P2">As it was said in the olden days in China, there was a way of looking at living in terms of non-doing that was commonly taught.  To not kill, to not steal, to not lie, to not drink; but then if a farmer is planting a field, he’s going to be killing some insects and going against that.  And if our way is to not do, what will happen to shop people who are selling things, where will their motivation to sell things come forth from?  </p><p class="P2">We also have this way of becoming completely empty, where there is nothing in the heavens and earth, and no small self.  If we dive into that state of mind, not even holding on to an idea of not doing, then we can see this clearly.  </p><p class="P2">Doing sesshin whole-heartedly, not from an idea of non-doing, we can throw ourselves away completely. But we have to dive into this and make efforts to let go of ourselves for the sake of all beings.  And for this we will need that motivation, and we will hold zazen important.  </p><p class="P2">It is not about not doing as in, ‘we musn’t see, we musn’t hear, we musn’t taste, we musn’t smell’.  It’s not about throwing away all society which that leads to.  Rather as it says here, </p><p class="P3">“It is just as lotus flowers do not grow on dry land on the high plateau— these flowers grow in the muddy filth of the lowly marshes. Thus one who sees the unconditioned dharmas and enters the primary status will never be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha. It is only within the mud of the afflictions that sentient beings give rise to the dharmas of a buddha.</p><p class="P2">These are famous words of this sutra.  The lotus flowers bloom from the mud and the swamps.  That is why living in a small self-centered way is not the point.   We have to see what all people are suffering; to be among them and be able to know what that experience is. Only then are we able to be deeply motivated to bring forth that way of liberation.</p><p class="P2">It may seem that Vimalakirti is speaking contradictorily, telling us these ways of going about working on our wisdom.  But it is about how to use these desires and not to be used by them.   We have to polish that wisdom and use and offer those desires for the liberation of all beings.  This is Vimalakirti’s way of saying it.  This is the way of the Mahayana: to bring forth that deeper wisdom from which comes the ability to liberate all beings.</p><p class="P3">“It is just as lotus flowers do not grow on dry land on the high plateau— these flowers grow in the muddy filth of the lowly marshes. Thus one who sees the unconditioned dharmas and enters the primary status will never be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha. It is only within the mud of the afflictions that sentient beings give rise to the dharmas of a buddha.</p><p class="P2">Manjusri is saying that those of many desires become Buddhas.  Vimalakirti pursues this, getting him to explain it.  But it is also safe to say that a seed, where a flower has bloomed, they happen simultaneously because the flower holds the seeds for the next generation.  Not only is this the case of the situation which is in Buddhism.  </p><p class="P2"> When the Buddha awoke, he was astonished because he realized that everyone has always been endowed with an awakened mind.  People have so many different aspects:, they are different in their appearance, in their ages, in their interests, in their opinions.  We usually judge them on external superficial features such as these.  But we depend on that appearance only because we don’t yet know well that awakened mind.  So we don’t see these things as merely appearance.  This is what the Buddha realized.  No one believes that they already see clearly and deeply, with sharp cutting ability.  For awhile we have this awakened mind from the origin, each and every one of us.  We have a hard time believing it.  This is what the Buddha saw, though: that we all have it.</p><p class="P1">The head of a police department</p><p class="P2">Roshi’s good friend is the head of a police department.  And every day when he wakes up, he washes his face and then he chants a sutra in front of his very personal, quaint kuanyin statue.  After chanting a sutra to Avalokiteshvara, he sits zazen in front of her for awhile.  Then he eats his breakfast.  But he reads the newspaper which is necessary for his job only after he leaves the house and has aligned his state of mind.  </p><p class="P2">He arrives at the police station, the headquarters where he works.  And first he goes, not to his desk, but to visit each and every one of the prisoners who are incarcerated where he works.  To each prisoner he does greetings.  To each one he says hello and good morning, even to those with furious faces who have just been caught and thrown into jail and who don’t want to be told anything.  Every morning, every single morning, he says hello to each one of them.  </p><p class="P2">And eventually, every single one of them eventually answers, almost inaudibly, “Morning.  Well, good morning.”  Sometime he gets busy with police work and doesn’t come.  And those same prisoners who were so timid in their response to him, they ask, “Isn’t he coming today?”  </p><p class="P2">After a week or so, he gives them, just puts in their cells, an appropriate magazine.  And then, when they are used to reading that and have read it, he finds a book he feels would be right for them and puts that book in their cells.  And, in fact, they read those books and magazines.  If they get sent to a different prison, they ask him if it is okay for them to take that book that he gave them.  He said sure, if they want to read it they can have it, or else he’ll take it back.  They answer, they only read the newspaper and the magazine once.  One time is plenty.  But the book he gives them is so good that they would like to read it many times.  </p><p class="P2">These people who have been thrown aside by society, naturally do things to improve themselves when that way of life is made available to them.  They come back to humans’ basic deeper interests.  In our mind, even more so if we are a criminal, we somewhere deeply want to improve and cultivate within.  We have to realize this place of no self, no other, and no speck of anything.  But while knowing this place of true deep quiet, we cannot lose our passion for the liberation of all beings.  In the deep mud is where these men have lived.  The flowers begin to grow now, like lotuses growing from the mud.  The lotuses—the symbol of Buddhism.  It is the same with these men.</p><p class="P3">“Or again, it is like planting a seed in space, where it would never grow— only in nightsoil-enriched earth can it flourish. In this way, one who enters the unconditioned primary status will not be able to generate the dharmas of a buddha.</p><p class="P3">“It is only when one generates a view of self as great as Mount Sumeru that one is able to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi and generate the dharmas of a buddha.</p><p class="P2">If we plant seeds in the sky, we’ve never heard of such things growing.  What it says here is true.  Buddha seeds do not grow in the sky, but do grow on the earth.  The Buddha qualities do not grow in those determined for the absolute but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment after having produced a Sumeru-like mountain of egoistic views.  All of our desires produce these seeds.  </p><p class="P3">“Therefore, you should understand that all the afflictions constitute the seed of the Tathāgata. It is like not being able to attain the priceless jewel-pearl without entering the ocean. Therefore, if one does not enter the great sea of the afflictions, one will not be able to attain the jewel of omniscience.”</p><p class="P2">And the same is true of our deep mind:  without knowing desire, we can’t know this passion that leads us to help liberate all beings.  And this is the very basis of the way of the Mahayana.</p><p class="P2">In this way, Manjusri and Vimalakirti continue their exchange.  All of the top disciples of the Buddha, who had in the past been criticized by Vimalakirti, had refused to even visit him when asked by the Buddha to do so.  That is why finally, only Manjusri would go, even if he felt that he was not capable of being as wise as the Buddha.  He thought he was insufficient for the job.  But as soon as it was known that Manjusri and Vimalakirti were going to meet, that’s all it took.  All of the 32,000 bodhisattvas, all of the top disciples of the Buddha, they all wanted to be there when Manjusri and Vimalakirti would be speaking together. </p><p class="P2">In a small room where every single thing had been put away, Vimalakirti rested.  Vimalakirti had gotten rid of everything in that room, and it appeared, as it was measured, the room was as small as if a 4 and 1/2 mat room.  But in fact in that very room Vimalakirti was giving his attention to the entire universe.  And that is why all the 32,000 bodhisattvas and the ten major disciples all fit into this small room and were able to hear  this famous mondo between Vimalakirti and Manjusri. </p><p class="P3">4. At this time Mahākāśyapa exclaimed, “Excellent, excellent, Mañjuśrī! It is well that you have spoken thus; truly, it is as you have said! The field of the sensory troubles constitutes the seed of the Tathāgata.</p><p class="P3">“We [disciples] are now unable to bear generating the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. It will only be after [we have committed] the transgressions [leading to] the five interminable [hells] that we will be able to generate that intention and generate the dharmas of a buddha. [As we are] now we will never be able to generate it.</p><p class="P2">Daikasho (Mahākāśyapa) then took on the role of the bad guy in the plot.  And first he says that it is true that we are able to know this great awakening because we have these passions.  These passions are, as they are, the seeds of the Tathagatha, the seeds of wisdom. It is from this compassion that all things come forth.  Hearing this, he had been very impressed and deeply moved.</p><p class="P3">5. “It is like a man whose sense organs are destroyed being unable to benefit from the five desires. Likewise, śrāvakas who have eradicated the fetters are unable to benefit from the dharmas of a buddha and will never vow [to achieve buddhahood].</p><p class="P2">The top arhat is Daikasho, and he agrees that this body and mind must be offered to the liberation of all beings.  We can do this because we know all these desires.  That is why we can be so useful.  But that is possible for bodhisattvas only.  Only when we have done the worst possible things, made the worst possible mistakes can we become able to do this.  Only those guilty of the five deadly sins can conceive the spirit of enlightenment and can attain Buddhahood, which is the full accomplishment of the qualities of the Buddha.  </p><p class="P2">Just as, for example, the five desire objects have no impression or effect on those bereft of faculties, so all the qualities of the Buddha have no impression or effect on the disciples, who have abandoned all adherences.  Thus, the disciples can never appreciate these qualities,  just as those who are blind cannot see wondrous things that are put in front of them.  It is also true that no matter what color a person can see, if they have not got a deep desire to liberate all beings, then they will not be able to know this place of realizing that deep vow to awaken to the mind which is illuminated.  </p><p class="P2">He is saying this in a backwards way, but to be able to have these desires and not be in an already-finished-with-desires disciple, but be a bodhisattva who is still working on behalf of all beings’ liberation:  we need to have these desires to be able to see the place where we have to head, and by doing that we can get there.</p><p class="P3">6. “Therefore, Mañjuśrī, ordinary people can respond to the dharmas of a buddha, but śrāvakas cannot. Why? When an ordinary person hears the Buddha-Dharma he is able to generate the intention to achieve unsurpassable enlightenment and not eradicate the Three Jewels. Even if śrāvakas spend their whole lives hearing about the dharmas of a buddha, [including the ten] powers, [the four] fearlessnesses, [and the other] unique [dharmas of a buddha], they will never be able to generate the intention to achieve unsurpassable enlightenment!”</p><p class="P2">Therefore, Manjusri, the ordinary individual is grateful to the Tathagatha.  But the disciples are not grateful.  Why?  The ordinary individuals, upon learning of the virtues of the Buddha, conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment in order to ensure the uninterrupted continuity of the heritage of the three jewels.  But the disciples, although they may hear of the qualities, powers and fearlessness of the Buddha, until the end of their days are not capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.  </p><p class="P2">People who know they were mistaken can apologize and decide to begin again.  They passionately review their behavior and go on.  People in the world can also review their behavior and make a new, passionate and determined vow to do it differently.  But for a disciple of the Buddha, who has no more attachments or desires, they have nothing to review.  And therefore they cannot give rise to this desire to awaken to the illuminated mind.  </p><p class="P2">The Buddhadharma is not for being caught on sitting in stillness, but to be in the world with all people.  And to open everyone’s deepest mind to the great illuminating truth of the Buddha.  Everyone wants their own best fortune possible.  But to say, “Don’t see, don’t speak, don’t hear, don’t smell,” is like negating all of the possibilities for realizing this truly illuminated state of mind.</p><p class="P3">7. At that time there was a bodhisattva in the assembly named Universally Manifests the Form Body. He asked Vimalakīrti,</p><p class="P3">“O retired scholar, where are your father and mother, your children, your wife, your servants, your maids, your laboreres, and your attendants? Where are your friends your relatives, and your kinsmen?  Where are your servants, your horses, your elephants, your chariots, your bodyguards, and your bearers?</p><p class="P2">Manjusri and Vimalakirti’s talk was about finished, and Daikasho was soothing the top disciples who weren’t able to bring forth the spirit to awaken to their illuminated mind.  One of the  32,000 bodhisattvas stepped forth and that was Fugen bodhisattva, who addressed Vimalakirti and asked him where his family was, and all of his possessions, where were they?  Where is your father?  Your mother, where is she?  And your children, where are they?  Where are all of the people who cook for you? And your elephants and your chariots,  they are nowhere to be seen.  Where are they?  The same question was also asked by Manjusri, but Vimalakirti gave no answer at that time.  On this occasion he answers with a poem.</p><p class="P2">Now Vimalakirti gives a poem telling what the Buddhadharma is and how to walk the Buddha’s way.  This is all about the state of mind of the Buddha, not about the world of things.  So how should our mind be to live in the way he is teaching?  We have a body because of karmic affiliation with our parents, from which we have come forth.  But once we have a body we also have to take care of this body; from the endless past to the limitless future, we have to use this body and this mind.  </p><p class="P2">Once when the Buddha was traveling, he made a pilgrimage.  There he met his nephew, Ananda, who became  his disciple and was inseparable from him for twenty-five years.  After twenty-five years of being together, the Buddha told him that now he had become old, like a broken cart which would no longer have its  parts repaired.  Ananda knew this well because he was always with the Buddha.  And he asked the Buddha, “Well, how should all of us continue then, if your cart is about to break down?” As he was saying he wouldn’t be around for much longer,  what should they do about that? How would they deal with the problems that they always took to the Buddha?  Ananda was saying: Sometimes we will become confused, and without fail we will get deluded.  “So how should we deal with things at this time?”</p><p class="P2">The Buddha said, and this is said several times in his teachings: “Make your mind your refuge.  Do not look outside of yourselves.  Make the Buddha’s way your refuge.  Do not look to others.”  He said these same words in other places.  He is saying, here, that we have to align our body and align our determination to live not only for ourselves but to live for the sake of all beings’ deepest liberation.”  For that we must live in a good way in this life. And this is what is important: that we take refuge not in anything outside.  Only take refuge in that truth that we know, that place within and that truth of the way the Buddha has always taught.  This is the way of life of the Buddhadharma.</p><p class="P2">The poem that Vimalakirti now gives at the end of Chapter 8 is about the walking of the Buddha’s way.  Up until now it has been said that if there is a decided form, that is never the Buddha’s way.  If the Buddha is something to be imagined, and Buddha’s way is a land or a form to be imagined, then this cannot be the Buddha world.  The seeds, Buddha seeds in a world where we think we’re doing good only, that is not the point.</p><p class="P2">People in the world have limitless desires and delusions.  And from these come their motivations and deeper vows, which are their Buddha seeds.  The desires themselves are their Buddha seeds.  Here, Vimalakirti poeticizes how to follow the Buddha’s path.  Vimalakirti, himself, recites here in this opera-like text.  And in his poem Vimalakirti puts it in an operatic, very easy to understand, way.</p><p class="P2">In the Heart Sutra, it says to awaken with wisdom, the same wisdom from which the Buddhas were born.  Buddhas were born from wisdom and led to the Heavens.  Each and everyone is born with this ability to realize deep awakening.  To awaken to this, this is wisdom and the mind of the Buddhas.   No matter what a challenging situation or environment we may encounter, our wisdom allows us to move through it.  And by doing this, we deepen the power of our wisdom.</p><p class="P2">Hannya Haramita, this is wisdom awakened and freed up, where there is no obstacle.  And where there is no obstacle, we can realize this wisdom freely.  If we are insecure and worry about getting fooled, it’s easy for us to lose our ability to see things clearly.  If we experience this confusion repeatedly, then we can get suddenly challenged.  But if we realize that we have this wisdom from within, we are liberated by the having of that wisdom. And when we are living in a settled way, that wisdom which we have from birth becomes very clear to us.  This is different from having information and receiving knowledge.  </p><p class="P2">A baby’s wisdom is prior to any mental understanding or any kind of mental version of dualism.  At sixteen months, we for the first time know that there is a me.  And then at twenty-four months we know that this is divisible into two, a me and an other.  And at thirty-six months we become dualistic in perceiving things.  Initially, everything is perceived, and then we begin to judge and to evaluate.  We don’t want to not benefit in any situation.  </p><p class="P2">While our original mind is like this, it is also like a great round mirror mind, not narrow and limited.  We are a moving life energy.  We exist because of what that is.  And that is what we are.  This is the base of our whole wisdom, which is the true base of all people.  And this is also referred to as prajna wisdom.</p><p class="P1">Vimalakirti’s poem</p><p class="P3">At this, Vimalakīrti replied in verse:</p><p class="P3">The perfection of wisdom is the bodhisattva’s mother; <br/>Skillful means is his father. <br/>All the assembly of guides <br/>Without exception are the causes of his birth.</p><p class="P2">Our physical body is limited.  We have eyes and ears, nose and mouth.  Our state of mind is zero, where we are caught on nothing at all.  Everything is perceived perfectly and directly when we are zero. .  It is similar to that clarity of mind prior to age twenty-three months when we begin to see things as a small self.  </p><p class="P2">From there we continue, giving birth to many ideas and dualistic perceptions.  And then to these we add more and more habits and experiences and awarenesses.  But sometimes that gets confused by wisdom from within.  When we put aside and lose track of that wisdom, we get caught by preconceived notions.  </p><p class="P1">Niso Eka Daishi</p><p class="P2">We have the example of the disciple of Bodhidharma, Niso Eka Daishi, who became Bodhidharma’s successor.  He was an accomplished scholar of many subjects, but no matter how much and how hard he studied, he could not settle his uneasy mind.  He could answer many deep questions, but only intellectually.  He told Dharuma Daishi that he wanted somehow to settle that uneasy, insecure mind.  </p><p class="P2">Bodhidharma told him that, in Buddhism, scholarly knowledge had nothing to do with it.  And he told him to put out his insecure, uneasy, mind so that Dharuma could see it and take care of it.  But, while Niso Eka Daishi had studied so much and so hard, he said, “I can’t do that.  I did study a lot, but I can’t put out that unsettled mind.”  And probably with great glaring eyes, Dharuma Daishi told him then, that his insecure mind was not actual, and that was why he could not put it out there.  Niso Eka Daishi, who had studied so many things so thoroughly, deeply realized that all of that had been useless.  And in that moment he realized his clear mind directly.  </p><p class="P2">Of course, there has to be this kind of questioning going on to have this kind of awakening.  But prajna wisdom is not something far away and hard to realize.  It’s not something over there that we have to move some place to get to.  It has to be a deep seeing right where we are, and that teaches each person.  But we must realize this awakening for ourselves.  It won’t work to try to get it from studying about something.  </p><p class="P2">To realize it for ourselves, we have osesshin.   But we can’t spend the osesshin entertaining thoughts the whole time.  Rather, to forget the body and forget those thoughts, and realize the true mind directly.  Zen is said to be our awareness directly encountering itself.  But for this we can’t be holding onto anything else.  We have to throw away everything.  Throw away everything.  We do zazen and we throw it away and throw it away and throw it away.  We let go of it, we let go of it, we let go of it until we become like a vacuum, wide open and spacious inside.  </p><p class="P2">And this does not work by using a mental system for doing it.  We have to let go and let go completely, and that cannot be done rationally and mentally.  For doing this we can use a mantra, we can use a koan, but nothing is a tool that is absolute.  We are so full of habits, and those have to be actually let go of; that is what is not so easy.  We are here so that we can grab this opportunity with our serious and determined mind.  This is not something that can be done by a casual, half-baked effort.  But, if we once touch it directly, we don’t have to do it twice.  </p><p class="P2">As Master Hakuin said, “Young ones, do it once and you won’t have to do it twice.  Everything becomes clear and we can from there see from this place of deep clarity.  Of course, there are those like Master Daie Zenji who had fourteen great breakthroughs and countless small ones.  But as Vimalakirti says right here, “Of the true bodhisattvas, the mother is the transcendence of wisdom”. Only from here are we all born.”</p><p class="P3">The perfection of wisdom is the bodhisattva’s mother; <br/>Skillful means is his father.</p><p class="P2">While we say that it is characteristic of humans to be zero from birth, that is useless for being in society.  Our awareness may be empty, but for it to work correctly we need liberative techniques.  If wisdom is our true base, then the liberative techniques are what use that wisdom, and so our wisdom and liberative techniques work together.  </p><p class="P2">By way of telling how this is done, we have the six paramitas: charity, virtue (precepts), patience, effort, samadhi and wisdom.  To reach that far shore of being completely liberated, we have these six liberative techniques, the paramitas.  There are four more—renunciation,  truthfulness, loving-kindness, and equanimity, which usually are combined with these main six.  </p><p class="P2">When we are truly able to become our zazen or whatever we are doing, then a koan becomes usable.  And this is how we use koans to polish.  There are 1,700 of these.  </p><p class="P2">There are also sutras, but they are mentally understood, whereas we enter the six paramitas through the intuitive perception.  It has to be from there so that we can be without ego when we enter them.  If there is any way that we are adding a small self to the doing of the paramitas, then they are not being used as liberative techniques.</p><p class="P2">For example, the first one, Charity, must be done with its three elements of emptiness:  there is no one doing the giving; there is no one doing the receiving; and there is nothing there being given.  This is a sense of the state of mind of deep wisdom from which these liberative techniques are done.  </p><p class="P2">The second paramita is that of the precepts, establishing a mind of fearlessness.  Also for this we need deep wishes, great efforts, and very stable perseverance, the ability to be still and not moved around, and finally, wisdom.  To see clearly, no matter what situation we are liable to be in, it is these which are the six liberative techniques.  This great wisdom is our original base.  It widens into these liberative techniques, and these are the father— the father is the skill in liberative technique.</p><p class="P3">All the assembly of guides <br/>Without exception are the causes of his birth.</p><p class="P2">All of those who do training and work on the path in this way can then lead others to realize these things.</p><p class="P3">Joy in the Dharma is his wife, <br/>And the mind of sympathy and compassion his daughters.</p><p class="P2">Joy in the Dharma is not joy that turns into melancholy later.  There are many kinds of joy in the world, but joy that is sought  externally eventually turn into melancholy.  At the same time, to bring forth that great joy from our awakened mind: this is the greatest joy.  Love and compassion, as well, are without limits and bring great joy to all.  To awaken deeply, that is the greatest joy, and nothing else can match it.  And this is why we trust it.  </p><p class="P2">Our human form is a tool that we use, but to realize our truest source is the point.  And that joy gives birth to many other people’s deep faith.  Love and compassion are their daughters.  Love and wisdom, the ability of Avalokitesvara to take away pain and simultaneously to offer wisdom to anyone at any time.  Seeing society and wanting to offer help is our natural impulse.  </p><p class="P3">The perfection of wisdom is the bodhisattva’s mother; <br/>Skillful means is his father. <br/>All the assembly of guides <br/>Without exception are the causes of his birth.</p><p class="P3">Joy in the Dharma is his wife, <br/>And the mind of sympathy and compassion his daughters. <br/>The mind of goodness and sincerity is his sons, <br/>And ultimate emptiness and serenity his home. </p><p class="P1">Confucius’ one prohibition</p><p class="P2">In Confucius’ Analects there are so many things that are being told to not be done, but Confucius once said there were not so many prohibitions: he only ever said one thing that one shouldn’t do.  His disciples were feeling overwhelmed by so many rules about things, but Confucius said he only taught one prohibition.  When he said this, his disciple Soji said, “Yes that’s true,” and Confucius left the room.  All the other disciples turned to Soji and said, “did you hear what he said”, challenging him.  Soji, answered, “The path of our teacher is only one.  What you say and what is in your heart has to be the same.  Our heart put into our words is our truth.  To be sincere and empathetic; one with no empathy, even if they are sincere, is not truthful.  And one who is empathetic but not sincere in that is also not truthful.  This is the source and the only real teaching.  Everything else that was ever said is to establish this truth.”</p><p class="P2">Buddhism is the same.  Only the great mind of the truth.  And for that all the millions of words of the sutras have been written.  To experience this is zazen.  To know this truth of the clear mind with no speck of our own position.  The four seasons, one year’s events, cycling of the earth around the sun, the orbit of the stars, all the pain, the whole world, all of that is happening within our mind.  And our zazen is what teaches us this.  From this our deeply sincere mind is born.  The home is the deep mind of holding onto nothing whatsoever, not even one thing.  This is not something mental.</p><p class="P3">His congregation of disciples is the sensory troubles, <br/>Which he converts as he wishes. <br/>The factors of enlightenment are his good friends, <br/>On whom he depends to achieve correct enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">All the passions and the three poisons—greed, anger, and ignorance—are the disciples.  We are endowed with these from birth as well.  Some are of the mind, some are of the body.  The mind holds all of our past experience.  Our inherited tendencies, greed, anger, blind movement are with us from birth.  Our cells instinctively want to survive, to stay alive.  If we close off our mouth and nose, we get very confused and struggle furiously to stay alive.  In everyday life, our body instinctively expresses this wanting to stay alive through wanting this and wanting to get that,  wanting to gather and to accumulate things, and this makes us very tired.  </p><p class="P2">Also, we have an instinct to establish our own position in any situation.  And this also makes our mind very tired.  108 desires is what are usually listed, but it is not such a small number.  The number of desires we have is infinite.  But the point is to use these desires to improve society.  To use our desires to liberate people from their suffering. To use our motivation for that and to be angry on behalf of others’ pain, not just be moved around aimlessly by trivial irritations.  If we use each thought and each deed for society’s improvement, this is how the passions become our disciples and friends.  And this is the way of the Buddha’s path.</p><p class="P2">How to align our mind and our body?  This is our teacher.  The wisdom and liberative techniques of the mother and the father; the six paramitas (charity, precepts, patience, good efforts, samadhi and wisdom); , the giving of kind words which help make relationships go smoothly.  All work together in harmony to make the work go well.  </p><p class="P2">If someone is struggling, to become their state of mind and empathize with their difficult situation.  To give people great joy.  To give people what they need—help for their illness, help for not having food, help for their housing, help as friends, not as something special but just in that natural, harmonious way of giving.  These are our friends of the path.</p><p class="P3">The dharmas of the perfections are his companions, <br/>And the four types of attraction his dancing girls, <br/>Who sing the words of Dharma <br/>And thereby create their music.</p><p class="P3">In the garden of dhāraṇī <br/>And the grove of the flawless Dharma, <br/>Is the pure and wonderful flower of the intention for enlightenment <br/>And the fruit of wisdom and emancipation.</p><p class="P2">The sixth Patriarch was first a collector of fire wood.  As it says here, the incantations make their garden, their music is a teaching of the Dharma.  When he was selling firewood, he heard the Diamond Sutra being chanted from one of his customer’s houses, “Abiding nowhere, awakened mind arises.”  When he heard this line he was immediately awakened.  </p><p class="P1">Hakuin Zenji’s exhortations for Rohatsu </p><p class="P2">In Hakuin Zenji’s Exhortations for Rohatsu sesshin, in the exhortation for the fifth day we read about Heshido of Ihara.  One day as Heshido of Ihara was hurrying home he passed a nunnery and heard coming forth the words; “For people slow in efforts, to awaken to Nirvana will take three kalpas.  For those who want to do it this very moment, it only takes straight forward efforts.”  Heshido heard those words.  They affected him so deeply that he immediately became very determined. He used that saying, “If this is all I need, straight forward efforts…” and became awakened.  In this way,</p><p class="P3">In the garden of dhāraṇī <br/>And the grove of the flawless Dharma, <br/>Is the pure and wonderful flower of the intention for enlightenment <br/>And the fruit of wisdom and emancipation.</p><p class="P2">For example, sussokan is not only for doing in the zendo, but to use it all day long.  Or the koan of Joshu’s Mu: we continue it all day long in every single thing we do, no matter where we are and what it is we are doing.  The incantations of the dharanis make their garden blossom  with the factors of enlightenment and  focusing on that intention liberates us from extraneous thinking and further purifies our mind. We can then cultivate this clearest mind in everything that we do.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti’s surroundings were always peaceful.  People who came near him could feel this, and their agitated mind was settled, naturally.  If we are upset, that distress also affects those around who are close to us.  The same is  true with a quiet and peaceful person.  We feel peaceful around them; our sadness is forgotten, and our irritability is soothed.  Not something in particular, but our difficulties seem to melt away.  And when we go where they are, we feel clear and big.</p><p class="P3">The pool of the eight emancipations <br/>Is filled with the peaceful waters of concentration. <br/>Scattering the flowers of the seven purities, <br/>Here bathe the undefiled persons.</p><p class="P3">His elephants and horses are the five penetrations that race, <br/>And the Mahayana is his chariot. <br/>Control is through singlemindedness, <br/>So he wanders the roads of the eightfold correct [paths].</p><p class="P2">That our eyes see what is actually there, that our ears hear what is actually there, that our nose smells what is actually there, and that our mouth can taste what is actually there: these are the supernatural powers.  When we hear, we hear it as it is, not imagining or adding on other things to what we hear and perceive.  And to use these powers in a natural way.  </p><p class="P3">His elephants and horses are the five penetrations that race, <br/>And the Mahayana is his chariot. <br/>Control is through singlemindedness, <br/>So he wanders the roads of the eightfold correct [paths]. </p><p class="P2">The mind which is used in a correct and appropriate way lives in truth and speaks the true words.  And we also deepen our true samadhi living in the way of the eightfold path of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.  </p><p class="P2">The right livelihood is to always live without extraneous thoughts and wastefulness.  Right speech is to carefully use only necessary words.  In right action we function in a way that we have a true life that gives joy and strength to all people; that is right action.  Right effort is to continue to do what we start until it is completely finished.  And to live in correct empty mindedness and practice Samadhi as we do so.  This is the eightfold path.  Not just walking around thinking extraneous things all the time.  </p><p class="P3">With the [thirty-two primary] characteristics replete to ornament his form, <br/>And the host of [eighty subsidiary] marks to decorate his bodies, <br/>Shame is his upper garment, <br/>And the profound mind his flowered necklace</p><p class="P2">Next, the appearance, not about makeup and earrings and necklaces and dying our hair, however, but about deepening our state of mind and becoming round complete humans.  And if we live without extraneous thinking, we stay healthy and are constantly unafraid, while reviewing our own behavior and not looking down on others.  To see people with a deeply compassionate seeing eye.  Being sure that we aren’t making too much trouble for other people, and making efforts to help others.</p><p class="P3">His wealth is the seven treasures [of the Dharma], <br/>Which he bestows in teaching so that [beings] will flourish. <br/>He practices according to [the Buddha’s] explanation <br/>And rededicates [the ensuing merit] for great benefit.</p><p class="P2">As an era proceeds, our material treasures may dwindle, but our inner treasure, our inner abundance will be with us always.  Our inner treasures have given us an infinite sum of interest, so that we can share it with all people.  To live the truth of what we learn, and share it with all others.  Vimalakirti is telling us to make efforts for this and then things will infinitely increase and we can share this truth with all beings.  This is the Buddha’s path.</p><p class="P3">The four dhyānas are his seat, <br/>From which his pure livelihood is generated. <br/>Erudition increases his wisdom <br/>And becomes the sound of his own enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">The four contemplations, this is nothing so complicated. Rather, it can be boiled down to what the sixth Patriarch said, which is to give no extra thinking about good and bad to whatever is perceived.  And anything that is within, to add no concerns to it.  To see things exactly as they are and not to be moved around by what we experience.  </p><p class="P2">But like sitting on the seat in a train—if that seat is not fastened to the floor, we can’t see the scenery because we are spending all of our efforts to sit in the seat, which is moving around in the train.  But if we can sit down peacefully and look out the window and see things, then we can let them all pass by.  Because we are able to, in everyday life, see things from an empty clear place, we are not always being attached to or moved around by whatever we see.  To see clearly and precisely, and then we are able to respond appropriately in a positive way in each situation.</p><p class="P2">If our zazen is correctly done, then our eyes and ears see and hear clearly.  But we should also live with an 80% full stomach and other appetites; when we think we would like just a little more, that’s the way to leave it.  Of course, there is no life without any desires, but to feel that we are fine if we have what we desire and fine if we do not have what we desire.  To live in this way, then we can see and be clear.</p><p class="P2">We have so much input and education today with internet, but we have to be able to polish what we learn and input as well: to carefully choose what we learn and what we decide to input, and not drag in so many unnecessary bits of information.  And then to know what it is we are receiving and to take the essence of it.  This is what is important.  </p><p class="P2">So it is not about being like a goat that will eat anything that comes in front of it, even plastic, so that it will eventually have to have an operation on its stomach to remove the plastic.  But to use the learning to bring awakening to others as well.  To truly bring this wisdom to all beings.  This is the path of the Buddha.</p><p class="P3">His food is the sweet dew of the Dharma, <br/>And his drink the flavor of emancipation. </p><p class="P2">To not be always greedy for this and that, but to see with receptive quiet clear mind, and see how to make best use of whatever we have and whatever comes to us.  No matter what the situation, to see clearly where we are in each and every situation and circumstance.  We always think we want it to be like this or like that.  But instead, to receive it all just as it is, and resolve to use it in the best possible way.  Doing it this way is the path to liberation. </p><p class="P2">When we can receive it in this way, a clear path will always open, no matter how difficult the situation.  Liberation will always come, without fail, but we need this wisdom to not be moved around, no matter what comes. And we use the situations that come to us to deepen our wisdom.  We don’t want sickness and pain.  But there is so much of it, so how do we receive it?  How do we treat it?  For doing that we need a deep inner resource.</p><p class="P2">In this way, Vimalakirti is showing us how the way of the Buddha is not a fixed path or prescribed form but a way of being in everyday life, in every encounter and in every environment.</p><p class="P2">Yoka Daishi, the disciple of the sixth Patriarch, read the Vimalakirti Sutra, and that is what changed his life.  And the Chinese politician, Choshoe, as well, who was about to write a treatise against Buddhism so that it would be crushed in China, listened to his well-read wife who said, how could he write that when he hadn’t even read about Buddhism yet.  And when he read the Vimalakirti Sutra, he had a change of heart and said Buddhism could not only not be crushed, but we needed this in China more than anything, and he wrote words in support of it.  In this way we can use our most sincere energy in everything we do in our daily life.  </p><p class="P3">With the pure mind does he bathe, <br/>Using the categories of the precepts as his incense powder.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti says that purifying the mind is very much like taking a shower.  When our mind is cloudy and ragged, zazen is best for clearing it out.  We wash our bodies and feel clean,  and we wash our clothes and feel how they are once again clean.  If the environment around us is dirty, then we tidy and clean outside.  But even if we are physically clean and in a clean environment, if our mind is still cluttered with thoughts, we cannot feel  truly quiet and settled.  </p><p class="P2">To keep the mind well aligned keeps the delusions away.  For example, we can see clearly what to do for this day when our mind is aligned.  Then we know when to sleep and when to wake up.  We sit in zazen, we eat meals, we do work, and they always are done at the same time.  To be regular and keep that alignment is important. For example, if we don’t eat regularly then our digestive juices get confused and we can easily get an upset stomach.</p><p class="P3">Demolishing the bandits of the afflictions, <br/>He is courageous and invincible. <br/>Subjugating the four types of Māras, <br/>The banner of his victory is erected at the place of enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">Our mind has so many thoughts that it can really be likened to a violent gang of wild ferocious animals.  We have five senses which are our windows to the world., but we have to use them in moderation, not to see things we don’t need to see, not to hear and listen to things we don’t need to hear.  Not to smell things we don’t need to smell.  Not to taste things and eat things we don’t need to eat and taste.  And not to speak things we don’t need to speak.  </p><p class="P2">If we do things in a way that is not moderate—overdoing it—it can become overwhelming in a way that is not healthy. If we hear things, for example, that we did not need to hear.  As Master Rinzai says it, “To eat enough food to not go hungry.  To wear enough clothes to not get sick.”  Or else we get caught on desiring more and more food.  Or we get caught on keeping up with fashion and spending money for something that is unnecessary and superficial.  But, to overuse these senses is not the fault of the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth.  </p><p class="P2">But also we cannot be too rigid about how to do all of this in moderation, or we start worrying about things we don’t need to worry about, such as when we will die.  Concerned about when we will die all the time, we get very upset and tense.  </p><p class="P2">The Buddha taught us to do everything in the middle way, in moderation.  This is written about in the 42 steps of practice: how we need to tune our way of living like we tune the strings of a koto, not too tight with too much tension, but not too loose. </p><p class="P3">Demolishing the bandits of the afflictions, <br/>He is courageous and invincible.</p><p class="P2">This is not to wipe out every desire, but to not desire what is not necessary.  To sustain the middle way is very different if we align in this way, but it really takes great bravery and courage to do.  And it cannot be done in a way that causes problems for others.  We have to live in a way where we can see what is important and best for our own personal wishes, but in a way that is not going to create burdens for other people.  With a wish to evolve, we can make efforts and then we can all polish each other.</p><p class="P3">Subjugating the four types of Māras, <br/>The banner of his victory is erected at the place of enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">We have the words “disturbance” or “obstruction” in regard to  working in our practice.  So how do we align that?  We can, of course, call it luck if our practice goes well, but this is not a way of looking at things in Buddhism.  However, there is an element of luck involved in our practice.  For example, there is the obstacle of having an extreme amount of desires.  To balance this we have to align our posture, and in our breathing align our exhalation and our inhalation by making efforts to extend our exhalation even a little bit longer.  This will naturally help alleviate those desires that are disturbing us and also help us align our state of mind.  </p><p class="P2">These efforts have to be made in our practice in every situation for us to be able to overcome our greatest obstacles.  For example, there is the mara where people think about all kinds of things and have a very hard time stopping those thoughts.  </p><p class="P2">Because we have a body we can do practice.  And still there are those who have a rigid and tight body that makes it hard for them to sit zazen.  And there are those who are constantly becoming sick.  There are those who have a very hard time physically, even from the beginning.  This is a mara that cannot be left alone.  We have to work on it with perseverance.  </p><p class="P2">For our posture, for example, to use a chair or to stand or to use a naikan way for working on our physical situation from the inside out.  It is not at all that we cannot practice because we can’t sit, not at all.  But we have to look closely at what is the best for our situation, and make efforts to resolve the difficulties.  Our body is a very flexible tool if we train it well.  To use that awareness to work with the challenges and not just leave things in a difficult state and full of obstacles.  </p><p class="P2">Next is the mara of things coming to us from the outside.  Just when we are about to practice, family problems arise, or a great crisis comes forth.  This is also a kind of luck, but we have to stand on our determined motivation.  We also have the mara of death, where we think how we can’t practice because death will come anyway.  Our task is to work with all of these obstacles and align  them.</p><p class="P3">The banner of his victory is erected at the place of enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">In the olden days in India, the various religions would publicly argue, with the king of the country moderating the debates.  And then at the end, the religion that won would raise a red flag, and the king would get involved and help them settle their differences.  </p><p class="P2">For one or many to do practice, there is a kind of environment that is best for training.  Places that are full of good energy and places that are not full of good energy have very distinct and different feelings.  Both of them are in existence.  And this is not imagination.  It is important to put our body in the place where we can actually do practice in the best possible way.  This is one of the flags of good training.  </p><p class="P3">Although he understands there is no generation and no extinction, <br/>He is born so as to manifest [the Dharma] to others.</p><p class="P2">We have the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance.  We can reflect many different things, but that mind is like a mirror.  It is important to not be pulled around by things we are reflecting and add to them attitudes of greed and anger and ignorance.  That is truly the most important alignment in our training.  And for this we have to align well our body and our mind.  </p><p class="P2">Our mind’s alignment deeply affects our physical body’s way of being.  If our mind is full of thinking of the past and the present and the future, our physical body, as well, will be disturbed if we don’t work with it.  And our way of doing this is our way of aligning our life and passing along our wisdom to many people.  </p><p class="P2">Our body has a life and a death. But  the mind—to not make it so small, but to hold our mind in a great wide open way, in a huge way, in an expansive way for others.  And then we are able to best experience our own state of mind and to express what we want to in the best way from our state of mind to other people.  </p><p class="P2">To be able to know this wide open mind rather than living in this narrow mind. And then we can be effective in the world around us, not caught doing things in a small or trivial way.  And not being moved around and caught by the small difficulties that will always be coming along.  </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti tells us he is not sick, it’s not Vimalakirti who is sick, but because the society is sick he has taken on the sicknesses of society in order to guide people.  Young people are the most healthy and it would be great if we could all stay healthy all the time, but it doesn’t work that way, and that is why for young people to be familiar with what it is to be sick and know about that, so that they can help each other to be aware of how it is not only life to be healthy and well, but to be able to see that all of these things are included in being alive.  </p><p class="P3">He manifests all the countries, <br/>With none invisible, as [plain as] the sun.</p><p class="P2">In the section of the Vimalakirti sutra on Buddha lands, we have Sharihotsu asking the Buddha why there is still prejudice, why it’s never ending.  And the Buddha said to him, where are your eyes looking?  There are all kinds of people and no two people have the same body type, and yet all people have Buddha nature.  But not all people can see it.  It depends on each and every person.  </p><p class="P2">We understand that we all have Buddha nature, and at the same time each and every one of us has our own individual traits as well.  To see this world knowing that, this does not make a person naturally aligned.  We each have to make efforts for this.  People are forever arguing and fighting over their many many differences.  </p><p class="P2">People who are blind, cannot see, but that does not mean that they don’t have conflicts.  If we thought there was a world of conflict, then we can also, by seeing that closely, find out that there is indeed at the same time, a world of harmony and kindness.  This is why it is said that we have to look at our society through the eye of wisdom to see we can do to make this a much more peaceful place.  In society, people pass through, never, never even knowing themselves.  </p><p class="P3">He manifests all the countries, <br/>With none invisible, as [plain as] the sun. </p><p class="P2">Some read all about the ways of people and then they try to help them all.  And this is the construction of the Buddha land, but not just to see this.  But to actually walk it and offer it to the people who are at the outer edge of society’s stratum as well.  To feel their struggle deeply.  To bring a great love to what they are doing.  To be able to see this and put it into activity is the way of building the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">He makes offerings to the immeasurable koṭis <br/>Of Tathāgatas throughout the ten directions, <br/>Without having any thought of discriminating <br/>Between the buddhas and himself.</p><p class="P2">Of course, there are many kinds of people and even the ones who may look on the outside as if they are somehow wealthy and doing well, may be the ones who are the most impoverished within.  Even if some are wealthy by material standards, they may be very impoverished, sad, and melancholy within.  We can see their pain if they just peel off one layer.  </p><p class="P2">And to see that there are some people who, while they are very quiet, are excellent in what they are doing, and they are people from whom we can learn. Learning from these people is an offering to them.  To be able to see all the different kinds of people and relate to them in the way that is the most positive and the most effective.  This is yet another way of following the Buddha’s path.  </p><p class="P3">Although he understands that the buddha lands <br/>And sentient beings are empty, <br/>He always practices purifying his land, <br/>Teaching the hosts of beings.</p><p class="P3">The various categories of sentient beings— <br/>Their forms, sounds, and deportments— <br/>The bodhisattva with the power of fearlessness <br/>Can simultaneously manifest them all.</p><p class="P2">If we open our prajna wisdom, then we can see that everyone, people with money or people with no money,  is empty inside.  We are all physical bodies, but we are always changing form, being made up of molecules and atoms that are constantly gathering and then separating, in flux.  Our life is only a very short period in a long process.  </p><p class="P2">A person who was, in the olden days, doing farming wrote that even if there were going to be terrible floods or disastrous circumstances, they would continue doing that farming. For all they knew, it was going to be only bad weather, and there would be no harvest possible, but nevertheless they would make the efforts.  Or to take a piece of fallen litter from the street and put it into the litter basket—even things like this, big and small— all of them are bringing the way of Buddha nature into the world to make it a better place for all people.  </p><p class="P2">To see each person’s deepest mind is so important, not just their appearances as they travel through the various worlds of the hell realm, the hungry ghosts, the brute, the demons, the human and the heavenly beings.  Everyone is going through many different appearances all the time.  But rather than being caught on that, to see through that, to how they really are doing.  Zazen is not just for our own good fortune, but, to objectively and from a bigger picture, see people as they really are, and from doing that, find that deep empathy from which we can know the best way to live this path of the Buddha.</p><p class="P2">There are so many things that can suddenly occur in this world, natural disasters, wars.  We never know when we might encounter something like that.  We cannot know ahead of time what is going to happen and often we cannot prevent a situation from getting worse. However, in accordance with each situation, we can help those who are suffering it in the best way possible.  When we are kind and empathetic, we cannot know how we might be affecting the life of someone in a difficult situation.  When such difficult times occur, then helping people in this way is an expression of the way of the Buddha.  </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti covers all of these different situations, looking very precisely and appropriately at how to relate in every situation. In the doing of this with such precision and appropriateness, one finds the best thing to do for that situation, and that is the Buddha’s way.  To always be ready to offer efforts to society in the best possible way, the best preparation for doing this is zazen.  Then we can constructively give our functioning to everyone in the best way, in each situation.  Doing this is the way of the Buddha.</p><p class="P3">The bodhisattva with the power of fearlessness <br/>Can simultaneously manifest them all.</p><p class="P2">To see this and know how our zazen nurtures not only our functioning, but also provides an opportunity and a chance for all beings to mutually polish each other’s best quality state of mind. </p><p class="P3">Recognizing the affairs of the host of Māras, <br/>And while seeming to go along with their activities, <br/>He uses wisdom and good skillful means, <br/>So that he can manifest anything he wishes.</p><p class="P3">He may manifest old age, illness, and death <br/>To accomplish [the liberation of] the hosts of beings.<br/>Comprehending that [all things] are like phantasmagorical transformations, <br/>His penetration is without hindrance.</p><p class="P2">The Buddha’s way is not a fixed decided thing that we’re supposed to do, nor is it for proselytizing Buddhism.  To teach the Dharma, to teach and praise and honor it, this is not the point.  The point is that people in pain and suffering pray for release and peace.  And this is the Dharma.</p><p class="P2">From our deep ego attachment we pray for good fortune, usually to return us to the truthful guidance, to the awakening of clear wisdom to guide people to the obvious and clear better way, where everyone becomes fortunate, just not a single person.  In this source of each and every person’s pain, we see how the path is necessary.  This is where the Dharma appears.  The path is not something invisible and unavailable, nor is it some kind of magician’s trick.  </p><p class="P3">He may manifest old age, illness,and death <br/>To accomplish [the liberation of] the hosts of beings.<br/>Comprehending that [all things] are like phantasmagorical transformations, <br/>His penetration is without hindrance.</p><p class="P2">Many of us have experiences that teach us what life is.  We live, we age, we die.  Everyone probably knows the farewell to a dying dear relative.  And from that we come to understand, at least in our head anyway, birth, sickness, old age, and death. From there we teach that to younger people.  We teach about the sufferings of birth, sickness, old age and death.  You’ll become wiser,  and you will see that our material good fortune is like a phantom, like a dream, like a bubble.  </p><p class="P2">To not just say this, but to show them the actuality right smack in front of them.  You will get old, too, and this is what it is going to be like. To use an old person’s form to show that.  And also to know that we will get sick.  A dying person as well.  To show how we will die.  We will all encounter this at some point.  And not as a form of Vimalakirti, but as a form of everyone in society. All of these are the form of Vimalakirti, and this is the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">He may manifest the kalpa-ending conflagration, <br/>In which heaven and earth are entirely incinerated. <br/>To the hosts of people who have the conception of permanence, <br/>He illuminates [the truth] so that they understand impermanence.</p><p class="P2">At the end of this world, there will be a great fire that burns up everything, followed by great water covering what is left of the planet.  And after that a great wind where everything will be blown away.  These three are Vimalakirti’s form as well.  And this is also the Buddha’s way.  </p><p class="P2">We are not eternal in our form.  And we have left many toxins on the Earth during our time here.  We have had crises such as earthquakes and other natural disasters where whole areas of the planet are destroyed.  These disasters happen all over the planet and bring us all wisdom:  the Earth does not just stay the same and treat us only kindly.  The magma boils and various activities take place from that.  And destruction and disaster happen.  </p><p class="P3">Innumerable koṭis of sentient beings <br/>All come to request the bodhisattva’s [assistance]. <br/>He simultaneously goes to their homes <br/>And converts them so that they turn toward the path of buddhahood.</p><p class="P1">Tsunami</p><p class="P2">And also we cannot think we will always be here in the same capacity.  The earthquake in Japan was like this.  In retrospect, we see that there had always been great tidal waves in that area where the recent tsunami was.  There was even a stone that was placed a hundred years ago, four kilometers  from the ocean shore, saying to not build anything lower than this four kilo mark between here and the ocean because of tidal waves.  And yet this recent tidal wave from the tsunami had come up four kilometers from the shore.  38 meters high.  Don’t build close to the ocean.  Don’t build closer to the ocean than this stone; here are tidal waves.  It was written in stone about a hundred years ago.  </p><p class="P2">Now there are laws saying that no one may build closer than four kilometers to the ocean.  But if we had learned from our ancestors who told us this in stone one hundred years ago, we would not have had to go through this terrible disaster in the same way.  Now those four kilometers of land are being made into parks.  People can play there but not live there.  This is also the Buddha’s path.  </p><p class="P2">People mentally understand impermanence, but they don’t actually believe in it.  And we continually do ignorant things because of that.  Many people seek wisdom and this wisdom is Vimalakirti.  How can we do what is best for each and every environment?  This is the way of Vimalakirti’s teaching.</p><p class="P3">The magical arts prohibited in the scriptures, <br/>The various skills and arts— <br/>He manifests the performance of all these things <br/>To benefit the hosts of beings.</p><p class="P3">In all the religious teachings of this world <br/>Does he leave home [to dedicate himself], <br/>Thereby to release people from their delusions, <br/>So they will not fall into heterodox views.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti is beginning to cover more ground here now, saying it cannot be done through mental understanding, but only through the Buddha’s way.  We have the reading and studying of the sutras.  We have the reading and the studying of the Analects of Confucius.  We have the Bible of Christ and we have the Koran.  These are all the Buddha’s way because this is not about preconceived notions, nor is it necessary to get caught on one religious view.  That does not mean, though, that we have nothing to learn or nothing to do.  All of those other religions need to be learned, and then we can use them all for the liberation of all beings.  All of the meeting places where they share something—to use these opportunities.  To learn about newer energy sources, for example.  This is all about the Buddha’s way.  And to use a kind and friendly way of going about learning and using these things.  It is not enough to just read the sutras as well as the Bible and the other books, but to see deeply the central point of each and every one of these teachings.  And also to use that to liberate all beings.  </p><p class="P3">In all the religious teachings of this world <br/>Does he leave home [to dedicate himself], <br/>Thereby to release people from their delusions, <br/>So they will not fall into heterodox views.</p><p class="P2">It is not that only the Buddha’s path is correct, rather to see all paths and give them all life.  As was said at the beginning, the mother of the Bodhisattva is the transcendence of wisdom and the father is the skill in liberative technique. Leaders are born of such parents.  And not to merely satisfy our own ego adventure in doing this, but to return and align always at the source.  Then our preconceived notions and judgment will return to clear true wisdom.  It may seem difficult to return to this source, but if we return to our best open self we can see and realize this truth that is infinitely wide.  And in this way we are filled with ability to travel well on the Buddha’s path, and we will not fall into sideways paths.  And this is what Vimalakirti is teaching.</p><p class="P3">He may become the god of the sun or moon, <br/>A Brahmā king, or a world lord, <br/>And at times he may become earth or water, <br/>Or again wind or fire.</p><p class="P3">When there are epidemics in the middle of a kalpa <br/>He manifests himself as medicinal plants. <br/>If someone takes [these herbs], <br/>They eradicate illness and eliminate the host of poisons.</p><p class="P2">He’s getting more and more expansive here, so the sun and moon are all part of this now.  The teaching of Vimalakirti, the Buddha’s path, they become food and drink to alleviate hunger and thirst.  To awaken to this wisdom is our zazen.  It is not about our small self, but about the truth which is much greater.  And we become that.  </p><p class="P2">There is no small self to hold onto. Rather, the whole world is woven in a way that we can see the Buddha’s way through it.  Not in a small, narrow, only individual way, or we cannot function fully.  While we are indeed individuals, we must be one of the whole of humankind and not be dualistically criticizing and putting each other down, but to look together at what is the source point of all beings.  This is the Buddha’s way.  </p><p class="P2">And if we do it like that we will not be dualistic.  The truth will be clear.  And this huge way of  this great work will be understood well, not for having our own personal happiness but to be part of a society, which is living in a great big way.  This is how zazen has to be.  It is a very central piece of the whole world, the world that includes our day, our deep wisdom, the sun, the moon; all of it is included in this deep, profound view if we look in this way.  This is where the rain is falling, the moon is shining, and all of it is the Buddha’s path.</p><p class="P3">When there are famines in the middle of a kalpa <br/>He manifests himself as food and drink, <br/>First saving the hungry and thirsty, <br/>And then speaking of the Dharma to people.</p><p class="P2">In this way, the Vimalakirti is speaking about how all of the great studies—astronomy, geology, biology are part of the Buddha’s way.  There has to be medicine because there are maladies.  Without the medicine, the Buddha’s way would not be able to continue.  Studies to alleviate the whole planet’s thirst and hunger in eras to come: there are so many people on this one planet;  we have to study about all of these things as well as we possibly can.  And doing that is also the Buddha’s way.  But it cannot be done in a small egoistic way.  To see it in its hugest version, this is the Buddhadharma, the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">When armed soldiers appear in the middle of a kalpa <br/>He generates sympathy for them. <br/>He converts the sentient beings, <br/>Causing them to abide in non-contention.</p><p class="P3">If there are great armies <br/>Facing each other with equal strength, <br/>The bodhisattva manifests his awesome power, <br/>And, subjugating them, imposes peace.</p><p class="P2">Without ever stopping, every era has these battles, conflicts, and wars, though they are completely different now than they were in Vimalakirti’s era.  Back then there were small countries doing small battles.  Now we can destroy whole populations and vast areas.  But just crushing and crushing continually is not the best way.  We have to build as well as crush.  Using internet and other media possibilities that we have now, we can find the majority power to even reform governments.  </p><p class="P2">But how do we then guide this new government so that we do not create further conflict and confusion than what was already there.  This requires a great wisdom, which has deep essence so that we can let go of our small self and offer what is best for all people.  Today’s way of great hopefulness is here.  How can we each use our wisdom to bring this world together? Understanding each person’s wisdom will help bring people together; this is where Vimalakirti is pointing.  Seeing everybocan help bring  about greater peace.  This is the way of the Buddha and the teaching of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P3">In all the countries, the inconceivable buddha-fields <br/>Wherever there are hells <br/>Does he go to save the beings there</p><p class="P3">In all the countries, <br/>Wherever animals devour one another, <br/>He always manifests being born there <br/>To provide benefit for them there.</p><p class="P2">Today we hear information from all over the world.  And we see how there are living hells, such as in Africa, that are still in existence, where there are so many people barely able to stay alive, competing for a very small amount of food like hungry ghosts.  There are still places like this in the world today.  We need wisdom.  We need efforts to gather funds to help.  And these are all the Buddha’s way.  We can’t stop making these efforts.  And they cannot be done only by individual efforts, but have to be done by all of society.  It can’t be some way that is vague and unfocused.  And this is also the Buddha’s way.  </p><p class="P2">Humans’ five deepest desires, as written in the Yuikyogyo Sutra, are those desires for sex and food, having possessions, sleep and fame.  In Theravadan we are told to let go of all of these desires.  These desires which are always coming forth naturally.  But in the Mahayana it says to keep them in moderation.  Not to try to put an end to them, but to use them if we know how to do that in a moderate way.  </p><p class="P2">For example, if we had no sexual desire we would have no descendants.  And we need food to stay alive.  Other things are also needed; things, for example, which make it possible for our elders to live and prosper. But to have and use these things in moderation.  The desire for sleep—each person must see what is necessary for their health, and not sleep excessively, which leads only to losing our motivation and not being able to recharge our energy.  Our need for fame as well, not to put this down, but to say it has to be done in moderation.  </p><p class="P2">As the sixth Patriarch has said, to add no thoughts of good and bad to things external, and to have no extra concerns within.  In our mind it cannot be only holding onto an idea of nothingness, but to see how to live well and moderately.  We will then be able to know how to make use of these desires and live together in the best possible way.  All of our life energy is involved in doing this together, and seeing it from that most huge, all-embracing mind.   This is the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">He manifests experiencing the five desires <br/>And also manifests the practice of dhyāna, <br/>Making Māra distressed <br/>At being unable to take control.</p><p class="P3">For a lotus flower to be born in the midst of fire <br/>Can certainly be called rare! <br/>To practice dhyāna within the desires— <br/>This is just as rare.</p><p class="P2">Continuing, Vimalakirti says how we have to see ourselves clearly and honestly.  We can’t have big gaps when we live in the world.  We’re not living in the mountains.  This is not only about the doing of zazen, but about how we are being in every part of our day. Even when we are feeling uninspired or feeling overwhelmed by big desires, if we become full and taut within, we can stay in our large mind and our objective view.  </p><p class="P2">We may at first not understand why zazen is so important, but here we can see that by inhaling and exhaling, while each breath may seem something small, the end of each breath gives us increasing full tautness that gathers like drops in a filling cup or breath into an expanding balloon.  When this gathers into full tautness it can be felt and then becomes second nature and we are no longer subject to the temptations and flagging of motivation in the same way. </p><p class="P2">We can then move in the world of desires without getting caught on them all.  And not only that, but while offering everything to society, we are like a lotus born in the middle of a fire.  We can’t even imagine this is a possibility merely by thinking about it.  But truly, the motivation and the kinds of actions and capabilities associated with our best possible potential are born forth, and each and every person then is able to realize their bodhisattva form.</p><p class="P3">He may manifest himself as a prostitute, <br/>Enticing those who enjoy sensuality. <br/>First enticing them with desire, <br/>And later causing them to enter the wisdom of the Buddha.</p><p class="P2">This is what Vimalakirti really wants to say, that it’s not about negating desire but about standing in that way of truth, which is our greatest fuel for being in the Buddha’s way.  This motivation is not external, and it’s not about being confused by desires and the world.  It is because we have seen clearly that which has to be done, and then we are able to be in the world in a clear, un-confused way because we are not being pulled around by desires.  With efforts, we are able to build that best possible environment.  And this is the way of the Mahayana, not just for one’s self but for all people.  This is what is important here.  This is our best energy for creating beings who are living in their highest potential.</p><p class="P2">As you can see here, this is a world of socialism of the mind, not socialism of the society.  To be awake to and aware of the possibility of all beings’ best potential being realized.  And this is what is called awakening to the mind of illumination in every being.  And with this state of mind, to bring our energy to all in society.  This is why people cannot be special or be functioning from their ego.  And this is why Vimalakirti says we can’t just make vague plans and have some kind of blurry idea about it.  It has to be that place where all beings’ energy is best used.  And this is why the Buddha’s way is so important.  Zazen, as well, brings forth this energy.  We discover this energy and then we are able to realize it in such a way that all beings can bring it forth.  </p><p class="P3">He may become a village master, <br/>Or become a merchant guide, <br/>National teacher, great minister— <br/>In order to benefit sentient beings.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti’s deepest vow and functioning are the same as those of Avalokiteshvara.  Avalokiteshvara can assume every possible shape and form to bring forth wisdom in any situation.  For a parent who has lost a child, for example, Avalokiteshvara teaches them how a child may have a very thin karmic connection to a certain birth.  And then Avalokiteshvara teaches the mother to remember the joy of being a mother and how glad she was to be able to have a child. In this way she helps turn the losing of a child into a deeper wisdom.  </p><p class="P2">When someone we love dies, we become insecure, we become desperate.  And that is a hard place to turn into wisdom. there.  But in this ever changing, turbulent world, we need this kind of wisdom, especially to go beyond our insecurities.  To see and gain this wisdom, to know how to go beyond the deepest suffering: we learn this from these difficult situations.  </p><p class="P2">In the whole Universe there is wisdom coming through everything, living in each and every thing.  Also, within each of us there is infinite wisdom.  We are born with infinite wisdom, but if we don’t encounter certain circumstances, that wisdom does not come forth.  When we have to resolve something very difficult, our wisdom is born.  So we must never ever run away from difficult situations. </p><p class="P2">In the small town, in the large city, to enter among people, and even if we receive negative treatment, to not be shamed.  And if people leave behind their clear objectivity, to become full of grudges, this is also the Buddha’s way.  To become the ‘great minister’, then, and see things from the one thousand year view! Master Taigen Shigen Zenji of Sogen-ji, left those words.  To see things from the one thousand year view.  </p><p class="P2">How should society be?  How should humanity be?  Not just dwelling on profit, but to see what humans simply must not do, must not leave behind on this planet.  To be able to see and to act accordingly.  This is also the Buddha’s way.  The politican’s wisdom is also the Buddha’s way.  Not only for doing things for your own profit, or for political benefit, but to do it for the descendants and to do it in a way that brings forth wisdom.  This is also the Buddha’s way.  </p><p class="P3">For the destitute <br/>He manifests inexhaustible treasuries, <br/>Thereby exhorting and guiding them, <br/>Causing them to generate the intention to achieve enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">In the world, the number of destitute people increases, often while politicians live luxuriously and make decisions not to help  those who are impoverished.  The power and the ambitions of politicians go beyond their material resources.  This is because they have no true refuge within.  To teach them the joy of giving is also the Buddha’s way.  And to help them see what making a living is really for, and how not to waste things so they can give their gifts to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.  </p><p class="P2">Our greed is intrinsically without limit, while there are basic things that people need that they are going without.  We have to not only stop that kind of greed but also to align it: to learn to serve others and to share what we already have.  This is also the Buddha’s way.  </p><p class="P2">From great emptiness all things are born forth. The flowers, the moon, the pavilions.  Humans’ deepest mind is found where nothing unnecessary is desired.  The deep satisfaction is in the abundance of mind.  Deep wisdom is not an abundance that is moved by outside, external, material things.  </p><p class="P2">In a famous rock garden at Ryoan-ji temple in Kyoto, , there is a stone in which there is water, and on it is a writing that says, “To know what is sufficient.”  This is also a Zen saying about wisdom.  If our mind is full and deep, we don’t rely on unnecessary things.  This does not mean to be enduring severe deprivation all the time.  But to be moderate and not use things we don’t need.  </p><p class="P2">For example, in winter to wear enough clothes to stay warm and healthy, and to, in general, eat the food that we need to stay healthy, but not to be pulled around by luxurious expensive clothing and gourmet food.  The other day, the King of Bhutan came to Japan and said, “For people in Bhutan, the quality of their life, whether it is  excellent or poor,  is measured by their inner satisfaction and inner joy.”  This is their country’s basis for measuring how the people in the country are doing. Maybe this was only for public relations, but it was spoken in a very realistic way.  This, too, is also the way of the Buddha, says Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P3">For those who are selfish and conceited, <br/>He manifests himself as a great warrior, <br/>Decimating the pretensions [of sentient beings], <br/>And causing them to abide in the unsurpassable path.</p><p class="P3">The hosts of the fear-stricken <br/>He shields and comforts, <br/>First giving them fearlessness<br/>And then causing them to generate the intention to achieve enlightenment.</p><p class="P3">He may manifest the transcendence of licentious desire <br/>And become a transcendent of the five penetrations, <br/>Guiding the hosts of beings <br/>And making them abide in morality, forbearance, and sympathy.</p><p class="P2">There are people who are conceited and proud, thinking only that they have such great power and ability, never caring if they are making problems for others with their assumptions, just assuming it is okay to do that.  Meanwhile, people around them have to put up with that.  Those people who are selfish and conceited have such strong energy that it may seem impossible to get along with them. . But that will only go on as long as that energy is young.  It will not continue, and they will have to learn what it is to be without it.  This is also the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P2">To rely on just your many external resources, that will not last.  We have to offer everything we are to all people.  And this is also the Buddha’s way.  Power and material things will always, always fade.  We all will have to part from people that we love and things that we love and somehow endure that.  We can’t take things with us when we die.  And yet bad things we leave behind us don’t disappear when we do, necessarily.  Rather, to offer things to others and be one with all beings in deepest possible empathy.  </p><p class="P3">Seeing those who should be served, <br/>He manifests himself as a servant. <br/>Taking joy in the affirmation of one’s intention, <br/>Those to be honored generate the intention to achieve enlightenment.</p><p class="P2">And if we are with others who are terribly afraid, we encourage them, help them find their inner courage, and take away their fear.  Avalokiteshvara is also to take away pain and give strength.  And this is also the Buddha’s way.  We have to make efforts to let go of various challenges.  And for doing this we have the six paramitas—charity, precepts, patience, using great efforts, deep Samadhi, and wisdom.  We also have the powers of our five senses, our own supernatural powers that we can use in this life in order to liberate ourselves.  And this is the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P3">Inaccordance with the needs of others, <br/>He causes them to enter into the path of buddhahood. <br/>Using the power of good skillful means <br/>He provides sufficiency to all.</p><p class="P3">Thus are the paths immeasurable <br/>Which he traverses without restriction. <br/>His wisdom is without limit <br/>In saving the innumerable hosts [of beings].</p><p class="P3">Even if we had all the buddhas <br/>Throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas <br/>Praise his merits, <br/>They would not be able to do so completely.</p><p class="P3">Whoever hears the Dharma such as this <br/>And does not generate the intention to achieve bodhi— <br/>Excluding those who do not even seem human— <br/>Are ignorant fools.</p><p class="P2">In many places in the world today welfare services are available from the government.  People are helped while they are old or when they are sick, with their cleaning and their shopping and other everyday needs.  Nowadays, the countries’ governments are taking care of this.  In the olden days these needs were not taken care of in this way.  But now the government is providing these services, and this support is considered indispensable.  This is also the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P2">In each person’s mind must be abundance and empathy.  We need education for this.  And this is the Buddha’s way.  We all will have to be taken care of at some time.  And to help cultivate that abundant and empathetic mind, so that we can be kind to the caregivers with it—this is also the Buddha’s way.  To become a person who others can believe in.  In this world today, people have trouble truly believing in each other.  To cultivate a mind that others can believe in: this is the Buddha’s way. </p><p class="P3">Thus are the paths immeasurable <br/>Which he traverses without restriction. </p><p class="P2">The Buddha’s way is infinite.  Deep wisdom is abundant and liberating when it is encountered.  In this way, this deepest wisdom widens infinitely.  This is the Buddha’s way.  This wisdom has no end, and it awakens all people.  It is here that the motivation and vow can be found, and this is where each person becomes Vimalakirti.  Each building a vow of infinite width.  And even for the Buddhas themselves, during a million aeons or even a hundred million aeons, it would too hard to express their virtues.  But we are all these Buddhas.  And there is no end to the Buddha’s way.  Not just praising virtue, but living it.  Then we can see the Buddha’s way and we are able to polish our own wisdom and deepen it while offering this wisdom to everyone in society. We can see that right now, especially in today’s world, we must continue these efforts, and for this we really need the depth of the Buddha’s wisdom.  And this is the Buddha’s way. </p><p class="P3">Whoever hears the Dharma such as this <br/>And does not generate the intention to achieve bodhi— <br/>Excluding those who do not even seem human— <br/>Are ignorant fools.</p><p class="P2">There are some for whom this cannot be seen clearly—they just can’t get it yet.  But if we continue with perseverance, then good results will occur at some time.  We have to see clearly that it is necessary to open to all of our capacities and our abilities in order for this to happen. In this way Vimalakirti closes this chapter on the Buddha’s way.</p><p class="P2">Chapter 8, The Path of Buddhahood, which we have just been completing today, is considered the chapter in which Vimalakirti speaks the most because of this long poem. There is also his exchange with Manjusri, the representative of the 32,000 Bodhisattvas who are present.  Here, various teachings on emptiness are given, with some of the senior disciples participating in that part of it.  </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti says to the Bodhisattvas, “If you are Bodhisattvas, then you must have a deep vow and an awakening.  Please make those clear.”  And so, in Chapter 9, Vimalakirti says this to the Bodhisattvas and, just like the great climax of a grand opera, he has them all appearing on stage to tell about their own awakenings.  Already an excellent operatic scene, everyone has to tell, not mentally, but the actual experience of their enlightenment.  </p><p class="P2">While we live in a world that is dualistic, our needs are actually not that complex.  A mirror reflects things as they are—a flower, a bird, a moon, a sun—and all of these things, whether it is child or adult, man or woman, sick or well, all of these are reflected just exactly as they are. There is no dualism in that.  They are just reflected.  That’s because there is no ego in a mirror.  It’s only what is reflected.  </p><p class="P2">So like a mirror, if we have no ego we become one with that which we are perceiving at any given moment.  We become the struggle and pain, and not as if it is about someone else, but from one’s deepest state of mind, since we are not residing in dualism.  When we are residing in dualism—we are so used to residing in dualism that we no longer even notice it.  Everyone is living to have this dualistic existence noticed, to have someone see them as an ego.  </p><p class="P2">How do we live in a world of peace when this is how things are?  Removing that ego, removing the dualism, is a radical, revolutionary, way of changing the mind.  We have to be able to see this.  We have to be able to see that we are not dualistic and to see that thinking that dualism is how we have to perceive is not real.  Rather, if we can forget ourselves completely, we can see like this, as Master Dogen has taught: “To study the way is to study the self.  To study the self is to forget the self.  To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things.  To be enlightened by all things is to remove the barrier between self and other.”  </p><p class="P2">Our zazen is the basis for being able to do this, and is the Buddha’s way.  We follow our breath and we let go of our small self, simultaneously.  And see what great abundance and depth of mind that brings!  We see a flower and we become that flower.  We hear a bird, we become that bird.  We see the moon, we become the moon.  We see the sun, we become the sun.  No more separation between everything and who we are.  All of that is let go of.  </p><p class="P2">The Buddha saw the morning star and he directly, at that moment, let go of the dualistic mind and realized that star was who he is.  Kyogen heard the sound of a tile hitting the bamboo and at that moment let go of any dualism and became that sound completely.  These experiences touched their most profound, purified state of mind.  We are all endowed with the same state of mind.  And this is what is the mysterious part of the Dharma Door of Non-duality.</p><p class="P2">In Zen it says, “Heaven and Earth and I are one root.  All the things and I are from one mind.”  This is like a teacher finding herself in her students—a teacher who deeply wants to help the most difficult students.  Like an artist finding herself in a single flower and wanting to paint it or wanting to poeticize it.  There we find our deepest mind.  </p><p class="Standard">Like a business person who gives everything to compassionately take care of his work place.  Like a scholar who passionately investigates.  This is our true way.  Also for a caregiver, who finds himself in the dying person.  Here, an abundant state of mind is being found.  And this is the very mysterious way of the not-two.  This is also the mind of God.  The mind of Buddha.  That clear, empathetic mind is what God is and what Buddha is.  And here is where we can find that place of the mystery of the not-two.</p></body></html>
