So that this teaching can be treasured and remain in people’s minds, Lord Shakyamuni then says to Maitreya that she would become the Buddha in the  far future, to awaken all that were still unawakened. </p><p class="P1">1. At this point the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Maitreya, I now bestow on you this Dharma of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, which I have accumulated over immeasurable koṭis of asaṃkhyeyas of kalpas. Sutras of this type should, during the final period after my nirvana, be circulated extensively throughout Jambudvīpa by you and others with your numinous power, so [the Dharma] is not cut off.</p><p class="P1">“Why? In the future time, there will be good men and women, as well as gods, dragons, demonic spirits, gandharvas, rakṣasas, and so on, who will generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi and take pleasure in the great Dharma. If they are unable to hear sutras such as this, they will lose its good benefit. When people such as this hear these sutras, they must with great faith and joy realize their rarity and accept them with humility, explaining them extensively according to the benefits that sentient beings will receive from them.</p><p class="P2">We often see them together, Manjusri and Maitreya. Manjusri is the manifestation of wisdom. In every zendo everywhere, there is a statue of Manjusri. The zendo is for realizing wisdom and Manjusri is the manifestation of wisdom. The wisdom of Vimalakirti is also a manifestation of Manjusri. In the manifestation of this wisdom is Maitreya comes forth. All people are equal when it comes to the realization of wisdom, Maitreya is not of the distant future but is actually right here right now functioning with the wisdom of equality, that same wisdom that Manjusri brings forth.</p><p class="P2">As Hakuin Zenji has said, <span class="T1">“</span>Zazen in action is worth more than ten thousand times that of sitting zazen. Knowing this, keep this in mind and live from it. Most important for all of us, is to actualize and manifest what we realize and work in the world. For this we have to let go of all of our concepts. Use your work and become it completely without one speck of anything extra in the mind. </p><p class="P2">We use our whole being and there’s no separation between people. We do cleaning. We do sitting. We do eating. We become everything we are doing totally and completely in each moment. We realize zazen in action.</p><p class="P2">Manjusri is the awakening bodhisattva and that state of mind, when awakened is Maitreya. These are our merits received doing zazen and sitting. And this is something that was learned and brought to the people from the timeless past.</p><p class="P1">2. “Maitreya, you should understand that bodhisattvas [may] have two [inferior] characteristics. What are these two? The first is the fondness for miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishment. The second is their lack of fear of penetrating deeply into the actualities of profound meanings. </p><p class="P1">“You should understand that it is novice bodhisattvas who are fond of miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishment. Those who lack the fear of entering into profound scriptures that are without defilement and without attachment, and who upon hearing them become pure in mind and accept and maintain, read and recite, and practice them as explained—you should understand that these [bodhisattvas] have been cultivating the path for a long time. </p><p class="P2">Thus he asks Maitreya to keep this teaching alive though all the future generations. In various worlds we may lose track of our clear nature, but without fail someone will always remind us to realize that nature completely. The Buddha has given a deep vow to do this. </p><p class="P2">Those who would learn this sutra must then hear its teachings and not be caught on profit and personal benefit but rather returns to their deepest faith and motivation. Even Yoka Genkaku and others have been inspired after having read this sutra and have been able to realize deeply awakening. Maitreya is being told to please make sure that this happens continually in all times.</p><p class="P1">3. “Maitreya, there are two other dharmas (i.e., characteristics) regarding how those who are called novices are unable to be definite about the extremely profound Dharma. What are these two? </p><p class="P1">i) “The first is that when they hear profound sutras for the first time, they become fearful, generate doubts, and are unable to follow [those sutras]. Reviling them and lacking faith in them, they say ‘I have not heard this before. Where did it come from?’ </p><p class="P1">ii) “The second is that, when there are those who defend, maintain, and explain profound sutras such as these, [the novices] are unable to associate with [those teachers], make offerings to them, and revere them. Or, at times they talk about [the teachers’] transgressions and errors. </p><p class="P1">“You should understand that those who have these two dharmas are novice bodhisattvas. They only harm themselves, and they are unable to control their minds within the profound Dharma. </p><p class="P2">Bodhisattvas and mahasattvas are those of great courage. Bodhisattvas are those who are wanting to bring all beings to awakening without end. They have no concern about their personal good fortune. We will not completely realize the true awakening of the bodhisattva if want to hear words and incantations, but we become caught on them and don’t actualize the teaching in our behavior.</p><p class="P2">To be able to continually realize this truth, while always sharing it with others, always purifying, and like a mirror reflecting, we see our own actions and are inspired to do better. Do not regret any amount of effort in the doing of this. It is not only for our own deepening but for the deepening of all beings.</p><p class="P2">The Buddha taught the Dharma to many but when he taught the Lotus Sutra, many thousands awakened on the spot. And he warned them, your awakening is not about only you, there is still a higher teaching to teach this to others. But five hundred said, right there and then, that their own awakening was enough  and they left. They said they had nothing further to seek and they made no more effort. This happened because they were afraid, some said they needed nothing more and they were not willing to go further. </p><p class="P1">4. “Maitreya, there are two other dharmas concerning bodhisattvas who devoutly understand the profound Dharma, but who still harm themselves and are unable to attain forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas. What are these two? <br/>i) “The first is to belittle novice bodhisattvas and not instruct them. ii) “The second is to understand the profound Dharma, but with a discrimination that grasps at characteristics. “These are the two dharmas.”</p><p class="P2">While there are no stages in the Dharma, there are stages in people who are realizing the Dharma and this has to be looked at carefully. For example, we may realize a quiet mind, even from just reading about it. Without true depth, it can only know a shallow mental version of it. People don’t know how to let go of everything completely. But they think they can do that even though they have not yet let go of everything completely and think that they can criticize and make fools of others. </p><p class="P2">There are many who do not make the effort of the koans for example. It requires giving up everything. If we don’t do it that way, we don’t get the true flavor and depth of the koans. There are 1,700 or more koans. They have to be experienced in a way that they become our blood and our bones. This requirement is the same in different forms such as arts and sports. There are rules and ways to learn but this is not the playing freely of having truly mastered all of those koan and then letting go the rules. To be able to become them completely and totally. Just mentally understanding this and as a result putting down others is not the true Dharma. </p><p class="P1">5. When Maitreya heard this explanation he addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, this is unprecedented! It is as you have explained. “I will distantly transcend such evils and maintain the Dharma of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi that the Tathāgata has accumulated over innumerable asaṃkhyeyas of kalpas. </p><p class="P1">“If in the future there are good men and women who seek the Mahayana, I will make certain that they get hold of such sutras. Using their power of mindfulness, I will cause them to receive and maintain, read and recite, and extensively explain them for others. </p><p class="P1">“World-honored One, if in the latter age there are those able to receive, maintain, read, recite, and explain them for others, one should understand that these will all be established by Maitreya’s numinous power.” </p><p class="P2">Thereupon the Buddha gave his approval to the bodhisattva Maitreya: <span class="T1">“</span>Excellent! Excellent! Your word is well given! The Tathágata rejoices and commends your good promise.”</p><p class="P1">The Buddha said, “Excellent, excellent, Maitreya! It is as you have explained. I am happy for you!” </p><p class="P1">6. At this all the bodhisattvas held their palms together and addressed the Buddha, “We too, after the Buddha’s nirvana, will extensively disseminate the Dharma of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi throughout the countries of the ten directions. We will also guide those who explain the Dharma and cause them to obtain this sutra.”</p><p class="P2">And all others and Maitreya vowed to the Buddha, saying that we will come from even far away and continue to read this sutra and make it known to everyone widespread that all is, that all people are endowed with this true nature and all are equal. </p><p class="P1">7. Then the four heavenly kings addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, in every place, whether city, village, mountain forest, or wilderness, where there are those who read and recite and explain these fascicles of scripture, we will lead our palace retainers in proceeding to those places, to listen to the Dharma and protect those people. For an area of a hundred yojanas we will make it convenient [to hear their explanations] without seeking.” </p><p class="P2">These Maharajas, the protectors of the Dharma to the four quarters, claimed they would always protect this Dharma. </p><p class="P1">8. At this point the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Accept and maintain this sutra, and disseminate it extensively.” </p><p class="P1">Ānanda said, “Assuredly. I have already accepted and maintained its essentials. World-honored One, what is the name of this sutra?” </p><p class="P1">The Buddha said, </p><p class="P1">“Ānanda, this sutra is named the ‘Discourse of Vimalakīrti.’ It is also called the ‘Dharma Gate of the Inconceivable Emancipation.’ As such you should accept and maintain it.” </p><p class="P1">When the Buddha finished explaining this sutra, the Elder Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the great congregations of gods, humans, and asuras, hearing what the Buddha had explained, rejoiced greatly. </p><p class="P2">In this way the Buddha ended and all of the disciples with great gratitude and bowed and vowed to protect this teaching. That is what is external, and what is externally learned is only knowledge, not wisdom. We can only know wisdom from the mind within, like a mirror that sees every single thing exactly as it is. We have to know this from deep inside. It cannot be learned only by something that is mental. We have to see it and see it beyond any discrimination, to pierce through it and to see it precisely. </p><p class="P2">If we are dualistic we get confused and cannot understand and see the transparent mind held by all beings. We can’t name it, and so we call it Buddhanature. Everyone has this clear mind but few believe in it. To take away the cluttered obstructions, we need to be courageous. We have to pluck out every last obscurity. Only then will we see how we all have this deepest wisdom without exception. </p><p class="P2">To receive that essence and directly experience it, is to be as Shinran Shonin was when he was told by his teacher Onin Chonin, that chanting the Buddha’s name, that only doing that would bring him to the state of mind of paradise. Shinran Shonin taught that he’d been told to chant as a way to paradise, that even if he fell into hell, he would not budge in his commitment to doing just this. For twenty years he continued, and he did it in this way until he could experience it completely. </p><p class="Standard">Until then we must realize this, believe in it and not be fooled by the phenomena that pass by during that time. Not being moved around at all by anything. Here we can see the truth of the  Dharma, to know it irrevocably and deeply experience it. Through that experience seeing how there is nothing, nothing at all separating between self and other, self and universe.</p></body></html>
