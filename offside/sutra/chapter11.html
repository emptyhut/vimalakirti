Meanwhile, the Buddha had been explaining the Dharma in the garden of Āmrapālī. The land there suddenly expanded and became ornamented, and the entire assembly became gold in color.</p><p class="P1">Ānanda asked the Buddha, “World-honored One, due to what causes and conditions are there these propitious responses? This place has suddenly expanded and became ornamented, and the entire assembly has become gold in color!”</p><p class="P3">Ananda was the attendant to the Buddha and he was not with the  group at Vimalakirti’s. When the garden where the Buddha was teaching became golden and began growing larger and larger,  Ananda asked the Buddha what was going on.</p><p class="P1">2. Just then Vimalakīrti said to Mañjuśrī, “We should go together to see the Buddha, to revere him and make offerings along with the bodhisattvas.”</p><p class="P1">Mañjuśrī said, “Excellent! Let us go. This is just the right time.”</p><p class="P1">Vimalakīrti, using his numinous power, lifted the great congregations together with the lion seats in his right hand and proceeded to where the Buddha was. When he arrived there he placed them on the ground. He bowed his head to the Buddha’s feet, then circumambulated him seven times. Holding his palms together singlemindedly, he then stood to one side.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti has a house in Vaisali which is far from the Mango grove of Amrapali where the Buddha is teaching. Vimalakirti uses his supernatural powers taking all the bodhisattvas, all the Buddha’s disciples, 84,000 other various people, all the  heavenly gods, along with  the bodhisattvas who had  come from Shuko and placing the entire group  on his right palm, he carried them all to meet the Buddha in  the Mango grove. </p><p class="P1">The bodhisattvas all left their seats and bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet, then circumambulated him seven times, and stood to one side. The great disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, four heavenly kings, and so on, also all left their seats to bow their heads to the Buddha’s feet, and then stood to one side</p><p class="P3">And in the appropriate manner of polite greetings in India, he circumnabulated clockwise seven times in gassho. This huge group were all sitting in their glorious chairs which had been brought along by Vimalakirti. This is the vast scene which now opens with the Buddha. </p><p class="P1">Then the World-honored One, according to custom, requested that the bodhisattvas all sit once again. They all followed these instructions, and the congregation sat and became settled.</p><p class="P1">3. The Buddha said to Śāriputra, “Have you seen what this bodhisattva, this great being, has done with his autonomous numinous power?”</p><p class="P1">[Śāriputra said,] “Yes, I have seen.”</p><p class="P1">[The Buddha said,] “What do you think about it?” [Śāriputra said,] “World-honored One, I look upon what has been done as inconceivable. It is something that my mind cannot figure out and which my powers cannot even estimate.”</p><p class="P3">Sariputra was the disciple who was known to have the greatest wisdom of any of the Buddha’s disciples, and while he was deeply awakened, he still had not yet made it up to the level of bodhisattva. Therefore  in this great play which is a big commercial for the Mahayana,  he will be shown in a bad light.</p><p class="P1">4. Then Ānanda addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, the fragrance 553c I smell now is one I have never experienced before. What fragrance is it?” The Buddha told Ānanda, “This is the fragrance from the pores of those bodhisattvas.” Then Śāriputra said to Ānanda, “Our pores are also emitting this fragrance.” Ānanda said, “Where does it come from?” [Śāriputra] said, “This elder, Vimalakīrti, brought the leftover meal from the buddha of the Host of Fragrances country to his house [for us to] eat, and so all our pores are fragrant like this.”</p><p class="P3">Next, Ananda, asks what is that fragrance, he has never smelled it before. And the Buddha says this is the fragrance the leftovers of the meal of the bodhisattvas from the land of Shuko. </p><p class="P1">5. Ānanda asked Vimalakīrti, “How long will this fragrance last?” Vimalakīrti said, “Until the food is digested.” </p><p class="P3">Here, Ananda is saying how mysterious it is that food can awaken. And also that if our mind is pure we can realize deep awakening and how important this is. From the land of Shuko, 90 million bodhisattvas have come from so far. Having received permission from the Koshaku Buddha of that land whose teaching they have been receiving. He also has given the, permission to go to this Saha world to see with their own eyes and ears and gain the wisdom from doing that. </p><p class="P3">The Shuko land is so fragrant that  just from the fragrances alone one knows peace and  wisdom. The Saha world is so full of problems and conflicts that the bodhisattvas of the Shuko land were given permission to go to the Saha world and witness Shakyamuni Buddha use his wisdom to awaken its people and to learn that wisdom themselves. So they all went to the Saha world and directly experienced the abundant wisdom of Shayamuni Buddha. </p><p class="P1">[Ānanda] said, “When will the food be digested?” [Vimalakīrti] said, “The energy of this food will be digested after seven days. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti then gives the virtues of this food. This scene is now at the Mango grove. Buddha’s work is to use everything that there is to liberate all of the people in the world. This wisdom is this fragrance. The greatest wisdom is that of the state of mind of pure emptiness. This is that state of mind that functions with no self-conscious awareness at all. </p><p class="P3">He asked the Buddha what is this fragrance and the Buddha answers that is the fragrance from the body of a bodhisattva. Koshaku Butsu of the land of Shuko had given them fragrant food and everyone who had partaken of the fragrant food had the same fragrance emanating from them. Ananda asks how long this fragrance will last. Vimalakirti says, “It is a fragrance that will last until it is perfectly digest.”  And he answers that at first it takes at least one week, but the food digestion process varies from person to person because it is a mind food, it is not a body food. </p><p class="P3">People of wisdom who are completed will know this digestive process well. Unlike the material food, when this food becomes one with the person’s mind, it is digested. As it is when someone is studying knowledge, it only becomes its most useful when it is combined with wisdom, not just knowledge but wisdom with knowledge, knowledge with wisdom. Like a books contents can only become truly useful when we can function with it and experience with it. This is the fragrance of the food of wisdom, not of knowledge and mental ideas. Buddha’s knowledge comes to us in this way. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha’s, the wisdom comes to us internally and knowledge and information come to us externally. And they can’t be confused, even if infinite knowledge is abundant. Still if it is received from external sources. And so no matter how much we pile up external knowledge, only when we gathered the experience from it then and only then we’d be satisfied. But also those around us are able to be satisfied because of our experiencing which goes with this knowledge and is able to turn into wisdom.</p><p class="P3"> Only if we see everything as equal and are able to be able to see everything in this way can we make the best use of this fragrant food. </p><p class="P3">The dualistic world, not this world of pure and direct experience, we are frequently seeing but hiding the real thing. Hiding it in our ideas about it, not perceiving it exactly as it is. To be able to see the flower as actually red. If we directly perceive then it is very simple. We have to see that flower new and fresh each moment. But because we think that we already understood it a moment ago we are not able to experience the true wonder of this direct perception, and the amazement of what we see. </p><p class="P3">Seeing each thing fresh, as if for the first time, we do not add thoughts on to it. When we let go of those thoughts then we are able to realize that direct perception and let go of our mental ideas. If a person is still unripe, then they will be able to digest this food only when they ripen this wisdom. </p><p class="P1">6. “Also, Ānanda: i) “If a śrāvaka who has not yet entered the primary status [of Hinayana enlightenment] eats this food, it will only be digested after he enters the primary status.</p><p class="P1">ii) “If someone who has already entered the primary status eats this food, it will only be digested after his mind is emancipated.</p><p class="P1">iii) “If someone who has not generated the intention [to follow the] Mahayana eats this food, it will only be digested after he has generated that intention.</p><p class="P1">iv) “If someone who has already generated the [Mahayana] intention eats this food, it will only be digested after he has attained forbearance of the birthlessness of dharmas.</p><p class="P1">v) “If someone who has already attained forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas eats this food, it will only be digested after he has reached his penultimate rebirth.</p><p class="P1">vi) “It is as if there were a medicine called ‘superior flavor’ that is digested only after all the poisons in the body of the person who takes it have been eliminated.</p><p class="P1">7. “Like this, this food eliminates all the poisons of the afflictions and then is digested.”</p><p class="P3">We do zazen and we forget our surroundings, our body, our extraneous thinking. We become one with the zendo. To ripen and go beyond even our ultimate determination, this is an excellent state, but we have to pierce beyond all of this and realize perfect enlightenment or we cannot give birth to true functioning so that we can be of use to all of society. If our awareness is complex and confused, we have to realize, return to its clarity to work in the best possible way. </p><p class="P3">And the same is true of a person who has let go of their extreme thinking and everything that they do and hear is fresh and new. If we are tired in our being in every single bit of it, we have no ability to freshly see and act. Doing zazen, we become fresh and new and sharp in our perspective. </p><p class="P3">Zazen is not about guarding or holding onto a dark black state of mind. People often mistake such a  withdrawn dispirited outlook  as detachment. We have to be bright and clear in our zazen. If our life is one of clarity, then we are not moved around by anything whatever people do. We see it and know it directly, but are not moved around by it, and this is liberation. Our relationships with others are bright and clear, and this is  liberation. </p><p class="P3">One who has awakened will naturally want to share that joy with others and those who are unwilling to share it with others have not experienced true awakening. One who has truly awakened will realize this and function from it and be able to bring it to the aid of all beings. </p><p class="P3">If they still hold onto anything of a small self then the true functioning cannot yet come forth. We have to be responsible and go beyond our own self-referencing ideas. We cultivate complete tolerance with no seperate between self and other. Any separation between oneself and other people has to be let go of and  this is called Samadhi. Not being dark,  hard and rigid but be compassionate, which reinvigorates our functioning. Not  thinking about whether or not we will be able to do this,  instead seeing clearly and immediately that there is no division to maintain. </p><p class="P3">The ripened mind of a Buddha experiences every single person as their own child and everywhere they go as their home. What everyone brings to them, no matter the kind of a person, they are able to see them in this way. The Diamond Sutra describes various eyes with which people see their world. The first is the naked eye, the physical eye, that sees things in their material form. The second is the heavenly eye which sees deeper than external appearances. This is like the mother who sees at one glance if the child has had a bad day at school when they walk in the door. This is the same with everything that we see. </p><p class="P3">All of it is this world and to be able to see all of it as phenomena,  see it as it is, this is our eye of wisdom. We see the various stages of life change and progress from being born to living a life, to being sick and dying. All of them separate stages, all of them complete as they,  but seeing how they change going through a continuing process,  and we catch the true eternal in any one of the moments of that process. The whole passing-by experience, all of it is known well as phenomena yet each and every moment of that phenomena is eternal. </p><p class="P3">The Dharma eye can be seen in school teacher with badly behaved pupil, who in each exchange works in the best possible way to give this child the teaching they need. See all things in their clearest way and all things as equal and trusted. And finally there is that eye that sees all things from the place of compassion. This is the eye of truth that can, is able to see the whole picture and not divide it into parts. </p><p class="P1">7. “Like this, this food eliminates all the poisons of the afflictions and then is digested.”</p><p class="P1">Ānanda addressed the Buddha, “This is unprecedented! World-honored One, can fragrant food perform the Buddha’s work like this?”</p><p class="P1">The Buddha said, “Just so, just so, Ānanda.</p><p class="P3">Finally, Vimalakirti says if there is especially excellent medicine, it treats the person when it is fully ingested. And this is the same with this fragrance. Vimalakirti being sick in bed is expressing this. Many people came to see him and wish him well. And when Manjushri went to visit him, he said to him, Vimalakirti, “Why when we you are so completely enlightened, are you sick?”  And Vimalakirti says, “I am not sick. The whole world is sick and I only wanted to somehow help this poisoned world so much that I got sick too.”  </p><p class="P3">As we chant in those four vows: </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Sentient beings are numberless, I vow to liberate them. </span><br/><span class="T1">Desires are inexhaustible, I vow to put an end to them. </span><br/><span class="T1">The Dharmas are boundless, I vow to master them. </span><br/><span class="T1">The Buddha’s way is unsurpassable, I vow to become it. </span></p><p class="P3">This is, this stance of a Buddha, the way of the Dharma, and here it is shown how to fulfill this in our way of living. </p><p class="P1">Ānanda addressed the Buddha, “This is unprecedented! World-honored One, can fragrant food perform the Buddha’s work like this?”</p><p class="P1">The Buddha said, “Just so, just so, Ānanda.</p><p class="P3">Ananda is amazed at these words, to be awakened by eating who has ever heard of such a thing?  And  the Buddha answers further, it’s not only teachings of words, but the body shining gold and being fragrant is also a teaching and comes about from this food and its fragrance. </p><p class="P3">As we say in the sutras that we chant before the meals, the very same thing. This food is not only material nourishment but also nourishment for our mind. We also get warm from it in the cold weather. It brings us motivation and energy for our work. All of our billions of cells are reinvigorated, regenerated from this food, which also has a flavor. A flavor of sweet or salty, sour, spicy like mustard or bitter. The flavor of sweet is the flavor we first taste when we come into this world. </p><p class="P3">And then we can empathize well and become a delicious person who could be trusted well because they have undergone all of those flavors in their life as well. The mind has to evolve and this is written all in our meal sutras. And if we eat well, then this is eating from knowing how this is also nourishing our mind, not just superficially thinking about how this food doesn’t taste very good, that one will only give us indigestion. All things that we experience, all of them, are sources of wisdom. </p><p class="P1">8. “There are buddha lands where the illumination of the Buddha performs the Buddha’s work, </p><p class="P3">In this way, we are not praying to be thankful to a Buddha or sitting to awaken. There are all things in the world and each and every one of them are there to awaken us. Master Dogen went to China and he was not there for so long, maybe four or five years but he said that he had found out at Master Tendo’s place, the nose on the face is vertical, the eyes on the face are horizontal. And only that he surely saw nothing special, no great special Dharma. He didn’t bring any wonderful Buddha statue or mysterious sutra text, but he saw clearly that mind that is not deceived by anything whatsoever. And this no one can fool them about ever again. The sun, it rises in the east. And the moon goes down kind of in the west. And at dawn the cock crows. And every three years there is always a leap year. </p><p class="P3">Master Dogen wrote it clearly, the sun goes up in the east and the moon comes down in the west. And at the dawn there is a cock crowing. Right there that is the Buddhadharma. The cock crows when it is dawn and every three years there is a leap year. This is the Buddhadharma. When there is no budging, not being moved around, these things are as they are. There is the Buddhadharma. Not a something special, not a something to be thankful to. If without, if within there is not a speck of anything. If our mind is totally clear and not caught, everything that enters our noticing are our steps to awakening. </p><p class="P3">The morning star was what it was that awakened the Buddha. For Master Kyogen, it was the sound of the  the tile hitting a bamboo. Dogen heard a sound in the dojo and was awaken. The Buddha said in this world it is not only food that can awaken. If our mind is clear and free of any extraneous thinking it could be any sound, scent or perception. </p><p class="P1">“or where the bodhisattvas perform the Buddha’s work, or where the bodhi tree performs the Buddha’s work, or where the Buddha’s clothing and bedding perform the Buddha’s work, or where food performs the Buddha’s work, or where groves and pavilions perform the Buddha’s work,”</p><p class="P3">The people who have vowed to give their life to society, taking in people’s pain, giving them everything, serving them in their suffering. And when we see people doing that, even in the seeing of that, we ourselves can be awakened to that possibility.</p><p class="P3">There are people who make exquisite food, flavors beyond description. We taste their work and we cannot imagine how they can make anything that delicious. We still want to stay alive if there is such delicious things that we haven’t yet experienced. Our 97 year old former abbot at Sogenji was very definite about this. What made him stay alive?  It wasn’t about money. It wasn’t about having more things. He said without question it is food. This is what gives us the invigoration and the motivation to stay alive. </p><p class="P1"> or where the thirty-two characteristics and eighty  subsidiary marks perform the Buddha’s work, or where the Buddha’s body performs the Buddha’s work, or where space performs the Buddha’s work. Sentient beings respond to these conditions and are able to enter into the practice of the Vinaya.</p><p class="P3">There are those who see the expansive lands of the world and can only think how narrow and tiny our own small desires and ideas when there is such a huge, magnanimous  world. </p><p class="P3">Thinking about how huge this galaxy is, makes us feel how small we are and much we have to make efforts in our life. </p><p class="P3">People say that Tolstoy’s works were his face. That terribly wrinkled face with the sharp piercing eyes makes it a wonderful face, to encounter such a face can bring forth in us the motivation to stay alive and make great efforts.</p><p class="P1">9. “There are [other budd,ha lands] where dreams, phantasms, shadows, echos, images in mirrors, the moon [reflected in] water, mirages during times of heat, and other metaphors perform the Buddha’s work; or where sounds, words, and letters perform the Buddha’s work; or where a pure buddha land is serene and silent, where the wordless, the explanationless, the manifestationless, the consciousnessless, the unconstructed, and the unconditioned perform the Buddha’s work.</p><p class="P3">If our mind is truly aligned, we wake up in the morning and we feel the deep intention to work energetically as hard as we can on whatever we are doing. If we get sick we can’t move, we constantly need help to do anything. See the huge gift of being healthy and being able to do everything for ourself and others in our life. </p><p class="P3"> In the Diamond Sutra the Buddha says: </p><p class="P2">Thus shall he think of all this fleeting world. <br/>A star at dawn. <br/>A bubble in a stream. <br/>A flash of lightening in a summer cloud. <br/>A flickering lamp. A phantom. And a dream.</p><p class="P3">How soon it will all be gone,  with this teaching we realize this is the truth and it actually is like this, a star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flash of lightening in a summer cloud. </p><p class="P3">As if in a reflection, as if everything in the reflection will be realized as only that. </p><p class="P3">Every phenomena that pulls at us. Knowing it as a phenomena, what is it that sees that which is not only a phenomena. We have to realize how to see clearly that this is a transient world and not be confused by all of the changign phenomena. Realize the eyes that can see within and  beyond. </p><p class="P1">9. “There are [other buddha lands] where dreams, phantasms, shadows, echos, images in mirrors, the moon [reflected in] water, mirages during times of heat, and other metaphors perform the Buddha’s work; or where sounds, words, and letters perform the Buddha’s work; or where a pure buddha land is serene and silent, where the wordless, the explanationless, the manifestationless, the consciousnessless, the unconstructed, and the unconditioned perform the Buddha’s work.</p><p class="P3">Having left Hanazono college, a Japanese university for  buddhists,  doing a little bit of priest training,  then going to someone’s house for a funeral which includes the traditional great shout. This shout  is supposed to help someone reach the other world, but realizing that there was no essence to this shout. It was only some kind of silly imitation of an idea, only a trying to do such deep functioning. But everyone would just end up laughing at you because there was no essence to it. </p><p class="P1">10. “Thus, Ānanda, given the buddhas’ deployment of the deportments and their various actions, there is nothing that is not the Buddha’s work. “Ānanda, there may occur these eighty-four thousand gateways of affliction of the four Māras, which trouble sentient beings. </p><p class="P3">Ashikaga Yoshimasu asked the tea master Takenojo, “What is the true mind, the deepest center of tea ceremony?”  To which he responded with the famous haiku:</p><p class="P2">Looking over the garden <br/>there are no more colored leaves or bright flowers.<br/>Only a small hut in the distance.</p><p class="P3">That mind of tea, which is serenity, where there is no longer any flame, any flame of anger, any flame of illusion,  only that quiet place where there once there had been brightly moving flowers, there had been colorful fall leaves that now have fallen. Now all of it is gone. All of it was only temporary. Nothing to bring pleasure to our eyes. Only a simple hut near the shore, perhaps some fishing tools outside. Simple scenery with nothing entertaining whatsoever. This simplicity, not being caught by  beautiful flowers or colorful leaves, returns our mind to its source. When there is nothing there, we can come to realize a place where we are unmoved by anything. And that is what is being referred to by Takenojo as the center point of tea ceremony. </p><p class="P3">In the world, pursuing wealth and fame, acquiring many treasures, this is all so common. But where is the true master when we live like that?  See in the way of the Buddha, what is actually giving life to all these pursuits?</p><p class="P1">10. “Thus, Ānanda, given the buddhas’ deployment of the deportments and their various actions, there is nothing that is not the Buddha’s work. “Ānanda, there may occur these eighty-four thousand gateways of affliction of the four Māras, which trouble sentient beings. </p><p class="P3">Ananda had said that it was so amazing to be awakened by food and  the Buddha teaches how if our mind is quiet and aligned, we may be awakened by anything. We have a story about Sāriputra sonja who was known to be the most wise of the disciplines and Moggallāna sonja  who had the greatest supernatural powers. Before they met the Buddha they were walking together in a town. Each of them were already splendid teachers and had together many disciples. As they walked along they saw someone that amazed them, Assaji sonja was one of the first five arhants of the Buddha.</p><p class="P3">After the Buddha awakened at Bodhgaya he decided to walk to nearby Sarnath  where the five friends with whom he had formerly practised austerities but who had rejected him for seeking instead another way were now residing. When he arrived and he taught from his awakening experience all five of those good friends were awakened and they became his first disciples. </p><p class="P3">One of this group was Assaji, and he was the one who Sariputra encountered. Assaji walked leisurely and comfortably, his clothes, even though improverished, were washed and mended. Impressed by his demeanour,  Sariputra and his friend asked him with whom was he training and he told them that he was awakened through Gautama Siddhartha  and the teaching of the Buddha was of karmic affiliation, that things arise from causes and can cease from cause.</p><p class="P3">They had never heard this teaching, at this Sariputra and Moggallāna went and met the Buddha, heard his training and immediately became disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha. Just be seeing a person who is emanating this spirit of the Dharma or truth can bring one to awakening.</p><p class="P1">10. “Thus, Ānanda, given the buddhas’ deployment of the deportments and their various actions, there is nothing that is not the Buddha’s work. “Ānanda, there may occur these eighty-four thousand gateways of affliction of the four Māras, which trouble sentient beings. </p><p class="P3">Further the Buddha says that the four Maras are obstructions of training, always raising various desires and temptations. They tempt our various senses and steal our motivation,  bringing doubt and confusion to our mental processes. We have a hard time continuing, we get confused and deluded about our practice and how to proceed. </p><p class="P3">But the Buddha teaches us to use these distractive spirits to deepen our practice. We are all lumps of desire who don’t know when we will die. We are always being deceived, we have to see this clearly and realize the truth that pierces through all of the deceit, through all of the temptation. To not  be moved around by these distractions instead to use all of it to develop the Buddha’s wisdom, to put it to use in life and break through completely.</p><p class="P3">These are all various kinds of obstructions and environments we cannot avoid, but this does not mean these are inevitable parts of life. We just think they are real and unavoidable and this makes us lose our motivation. It is our deep compassionate vow to liberate all beings and this can’t be done with a concept it just won’t work. Our training has to be done with true passion, commitment and takes our greatest faith, then we are not deceived by anything. </p><p class="P1">11. “The buddhas use these dharmas to perform the Buddha’s work— this is called ‘to enter into the Dharma gates of all the buddhas.’ “When bodhisattvas enter these gates, even if they see all the pure and excellent buddha lands they do not become happy, do not desire them, and do not become elated; even if they see all the impure buddha lands, they do not become sad, do not become hindered, and do not become melancholy.</p><p class="P3">Our physical body is like a bag of illness and problems never knowing what will come next. We live in insecurity and then we die. It is in this world that Shakyamuni Buddha uses his wisdom to teach us not to be afraid,  to use these desires rather than be afraid of them. We need desires, certain kinds of greed, wisdom and anger. Desire can confuse us, but we have to persevere in reviewing our own behavior and deepening our own wisdom to accomplish our own evolution. We have to see that by using greed, anger, and ignorance in this way for transformation we can reinvigorate society. </p><p class="P3">We have to make use of our sicknesses as well, so we can understand others’ insecurities when they are sick. Only when we are sick can we become that state of mind and know what others who are sick are really suffering. We all have to die and that is why we have to use this precious life without wasting a single moment of it. If we could live forever, who would make such efforts?  The world does not go in the way we’d like it to. It is full of obstructions, but overcoming those obstructions, we realize this great wisdom. The Buddha teaches not to run away from the problems we experience,  instead  use the challenges and problems. </p><p class="P3">So the Buddha says that. “The bodhisattva who enters this Dharma-door experiences neither joy nor pride…”  Being in this Saha world, everything is ingredients for awakening. And while there are many advanced realms, like the land of Shuko, they are not to be envied. Everywhere we go no matter how wonderful realize that it is not about being  joyful or upset, but that the difference is we can polish ourselves. This is what the Buddha says to Ananda. And in this way all the bodhisattvas of the Shuko world learned from Shakyamuni.</p><p class="P3">Shakyamuni Buddha’s way of being is to take each problem as his own and vow to improve the world. To do whatever he can to help people with whatever  is necessary to bring them wisdom. To see the value of every human being. In the world there are many lands where people are not abundant in material things and have to live with wisdom and make the efforts needed so that they live in those various different worlds. The Buddha says to Ananda here:</p><p class="P1">They merely generate pure minds with regard to the buddhas, being joyful and respectful toward the unprecedented [teachings they encounter].</p><p class="P1">“The merits of the buddhas, the Tathāgatas, are universally same, and it is in order to convert sentient beings that they manifest different buddha lands.</p><p class="P1">12. “Ānanda, when you observe the buddhas’ countries, the lands are numerous but space is not (i.e., there is only one “space”). Likewise, when you observe the form bodies of the buddhas, they are numerous but their unhindered wisdom is not.</p><p class="P3">The flowers bloom. The birds sing. Yet some places are abundant and wealthy and some are full of garbage and stagnancy. So each area is not the same but each has its own way and people who make efforts. They’re bodhisattvas. When there is not enough food for everyone, to then gather resources from what there is and make food for those who have no money. In each and every home, there is always some conflict between human beings there. People are insecure. Help them by giving them wisdom to help them be guided in their conflicts by that wisdom. </p><p class="P3">All areas have difficulty but the vow, and all those difficulties are different. But the vow of all bodhisattvas is one and the same. In various areas, there are doctors and nurses who work and those who take care of people’s psychological problems as well. The form and appearance of these people and their work is different. But all of them are making efforts to serve all others. This is the world of Buddha. The Buddha world. Buddha is not all glamourous and lovely but it does have wisdom for everything.</p><p class="P3">In each place, in each situation we have to see and work with it. As in an opera, in an opera, probably everyone wants to play the role of being a king or a being the wealthy one. But someone has to play the thief and the bad guy anyway. Some play the policemen, some play the thief. Some play the judge. Someone plays the president of the wealthy company. Some plays the beggar. And if all of these are not present then it does not become an opera. </p><p class="P3">So all the different kinds of functioning are present. And humans are the same. And after the opera is over they all are friends and hangout together. This is just like the Buddha’s way. We sit in a company, president’s chair, and we have to act like a company president, dignified and taking care of business. But then we go home and we have to weed and clean the house and take care of the kids, even if we are the president of a big company, we can’t just be a good person at one facet of the life, one role. To learn the wisdom of all those different roles and do them with that wisdom for that role, this is the teaching of the Buddha. </p><p class="P3">In Buddhism we have to experience the same as when the Buddha was awakened, this deep experience, or else if we don’t actualize and experience that same awakening, the Buddhadharma will fade away. For each person to together realize this truth directly. And for that we have to clearly work on our unskillful behavior, inside and out. To clarify our state of mind. To purify it, in order to return to our true human nature. Because from our dualism we have to be liberated. To return to that totally honest and clear state of mind without decoration, without deceit. We return to being a clear human. </p><p class="P3">Just as it is taught, the first word is that understanding such as the koan of Mu from Joshu. We purify and clarify, purify and clarify, purify and clarify, and this state of mind where we are usually so egoistically insecure is let go of completely. And we can truly know that same wonder and awe as the Buddha experienced when he realized that morning star. </p><p class="P3">As Hakuin experienced when he realized the sound of the morning bell, if we don’t experience that great joy and wonder the same as the Buddha did, it can’t just be, “Oh, I already know that, what’s the big deal?”  To only know that mind of dualism and adapting to others becomes melancholy. Maybe you were looking good to others, but lonely and insecure inside. </p><p class="P3">So first we have to return to the pure innocent state of mind, then we don’t add on extra ideas and thoughts but become each thing, each moment completely. In awe and wonder, we see the stars. In awe and wonder, we look at the flowers. The clearer we are the greater our wonder. Like the birth cry of a newborn baby. No matter what culture, no matter what country, no matter race, a newborn baby gives a huge great birth cry. The same all over the world. This is the same as the state of mind of satori. Like a brand new baby would become that great wonder, the mind of awakening. That very same voice that is the Buddhadharma. Not some difficult explanation in ideas and words. But that great joy and wonder. </p><p class="P3">But sadly, humans make up dualistic complex explanations and cover up everything with those. Let go of all of those and then each and every person’s own individual functioning can manifest. Satori is always the same for each and every person. The same state of mind, but each person’s way of manifesting it is individual. The wisdom and effort is also different for each person, yet the purified state of mind could only be one and the same. Completely at one with all of society. Living in accordance with each moment’s circumstances. This is the last word. If the first word was that of purification and clarification, the last word is then manifesting that state of mind in each moment appropriately. </p><p class="P1">13. “Ānanda, regarding the buddhas’ form bodies; their awesome characteristics and qualities; their morality, meditation, wisdom, emancipation, knowledge and vision of emancipation; their powers, fearlessnesses, [and other] exclusive attributes [of the buddhas]; their great sympathy, great compassion, and the practices of the deportments; their lifespan, explanation of the Dharma, and teaching; and their purification of buddha countries where they accomplish [the emancipation of] sentient beings—</p><p class="P1">“all [the buddhas] are identically replete in all these Buddha-Dharmas. Therefore, they are called samyaksaṃbuddha, they are called tathāgata, they are called buddha.</p><p class="P1">“Ānanda, if I were to explain the meanings of these three [Sanskrit] phrases extensively, you would not be able to experience them completely even if you had the lifespan of a kalpa! Even if all the sentient beings in the trimegachiliocosm were, like Ānanda, paramount in erudition, and retained them mindfully with dhāraṇī, and even if they had lifespans of a kalpa, they would not be able to experience them completely! Thus it is, Ānanda, that the anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi of the buddhas is limitless, and their wisdom and eloquence is inconceivable!”</p><p class="P3">The Buddha then said to Ananda that if he were to understand all of the ways of manifestation for which there are many words, but all of these various names have infinite variety of essences, immeasurable in their essence and wisdom, but these are not able to be expressed as words of any kind. And so they are all called, “Buddha,” for want of any other way to express them.</p><p class="P3">So the word of the Buddha, the wisdom of the Buddha, is said to be written in the sutras, 5,049, with huge numbers of words. That is only numbers. There are infinite numbers of words and teachings beyond that because the problems and challenges needing teaching never end.</p><p class="P1">Even if all the sentient beings in the trimegachiliocosm were, like Ānanda, paramount in erudition, and retained them mindfully with dhāraṇī, and even if they had lifespans of a kalpa, they would not be able to experience them completely! </p><p class="P3">There is no way to teach all of it to you. Even if one could learn it all without missing a single word that they were taught, it’s still not the thing itself. There’s no ending to it. </p><p class="P1">Thus it is, Ānanda, that the anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi of the buddhas is limitless, and their wisdom and eloquence is inconceivable!”</p><p class="P3">When we awaken there is no limit to our wisdom and manifestation. It is limitlessly widening. As Eisai Zenji has said, “Oh, great mind, this mind we know how immeasurable the height of the sky is and yet it’s all being held in this mind. We know how immeasurable the depth of the earth is and yet it is all being held in this mind. The sun and the moon which travel in their course across the sky and the light which they radiate, all of that is being held in this mind. The four seasons, which rotate in their sequence, all of those are held within this great mind. Oh, great all-embracing mind.”</p><p class="P3">It’s can’t yet be measured this whole universe, even with all of those various satellites and things that are going into the sky. We send them up. We know more and more. We clarify more and more about the whole universe. Just as it used to be when research of the physical body was just beginning. We can somewhat know what sickness is people might become in a life time with the knowledge of their heredity and their past and their habits. However, the possibilities are infinite. We can now know those possibilities in a different way but no matter what we know, no matter what we know, we don’t know the mind that knows those things. </p><p class="P1">14. Ānanda addressed the Buddha, “From now on I will not be able to consider myself erudite.”</p><p class="P3">Ananda realized how huge this is and said he’d never again be referred to as the foremost of the learned. Even if someone called him that he would refused to be called that. And to this the Buddha answered:</p><p class="P1">The Buddha told Ānanda, “Do not become discouraged. Why? I have explained that you are the most erudite among the śrāvakas. I did not say [among the] bodhisattvas. But stop, Ānanda! The wise should not [attempt to] evaluate the bodhisattvas. How could the total depth of the ocean be calculated? All the merits of the bodhisattvas’ meditation, wisdom, dhāraṇī, and eloquence are immeasurable.</p><p class="P3">You were called that by me, don’t put yourself down. We see how science has learned so much, to be able to learn deeply we need our huge ability. If people only do this for their own satisfaction, it cannot grow. Only when we offer all of our efforts for all beings can we match the huge teachings offered us. Ananda is taught not to be caught on your small self. Let go of your views of yourself and realize that your whole ability is ever expanding wisdom.</p><p class="P1">The wise should not [attempt to] evaluate the bodhisattvas. How could the total depth of the ocean be calculated? All the merits of the bodhisattvas’ meditation, wisdom, dhāraṇī, and eloquence are immeasurable.</p><p class="P3">You cannot measure this infinite wisdom.</p><p class="P1">“Ānanda, you [śrāvakas] have forsaken the practices of the bodhisattva. </p><p class="P3">Ananda don’t try to fathom the deeds of the bodhisattvas. It’s not something which you can understand with your mental ideas. Just like the fragrance of the vast land of Shuko, where you were and the small place where Vimalakirti was laying sick, a room which was but a few metres yet held multitudes of bodhisattvas. All of those bodhisattvas and all of their chairs were carried from Vaisali to the Mango Grove on the palm of the hand of Vimalakirti. </p><p class="P3">Our mind is infinte, we are able to know infinite things. We have a vast ability, and just consider how a whole ocean can be seen and fit into one small eyeball. Or a limitless sky, as far as we look it does not end, yet it can fit and be seen within our eyes. Do not miss the point that any advance begins with sharp seeing that makes it possible to develop a hypothesis that was then proven. </p><p class="P1">The power of numinous penetration that Vimalakīrti has manifested on this one occasion would be impossible for śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas to do by their powers of transformation even in a hundred thousand kalpas.”</p><p class="P3">We have to let go of our small self  to be able to see the huge unimaginably profound ability of all of these possibilities. Know that we are all able to do the same if we let go of our dualistic thinking and extraneous ideas. This is way that the Buddha taught.</p><p class="P1">15. At that time the bodhisattvas who had come from the Host of Fragrances world held their palms together and addressed the Buddha, “World honored One, when we first saw this land we generated the concept of its inferiority. Now we are ashamed of ourselves and have abandoned this attitude. Why? The skillful means of the buddhas are inconceivable. In order to save sentient beings, they manifest different buddha countries in accordance with the responses of [sentient beings].</p><p class="P1">“Please, O World-honored One, bestow upon us a bit of your Dharma as we return to the other world, so that we might remember you.”</p><p class="P3">This Saba world where we live, at first we all thought what an ugly and terrible world it was, but we now regret that. We see that we saw that way because our minds were ugly. We see that we need this world to be able to liberate people. Our way of seeing was lopsided. The Buddha’s expedient means are profoundly mysterious. If we have a huge state of mind we can realize a vast land. We can live in a place of sharpness and clarity. A person who is living only for their own profit will not see such a land. </p><p class="P1">16. The Buddha told the bodhisattvas, “You should learn the teaching of the emancipation of the exhaustible and inexhaustible. What is the exhaustible?</p><p class="P1">“It is the conditioned dharmas. What is the inexhaustible? It is the unconditioned dharmas. If you are bodhisattvas, you should neither exhaust the conditioned nor abide in the unconditioned.</p><p class="P3">Then the Buddha said to the myriad bodhisattvas, teachings are infinite, please listen to this. We have a body. It is phenomena, and things of form will always fade away because they are perishable. There is also an indestructible dharma, this is the world of satori. People in every era understand the indestructible is connected to all beings.</p><p class="P3">This world has no fixed form. It is always changing, always transient. We think we have done this and done that, but this is only relevant when we are alive and fades away when we die. The uncompounded, the indestructible is the satori that does not die. Compounded  things are transient, they all will die. Don’t understand this only mentally. The rain and the sunshine, they help life and not because they feel like it. “Oh, it’s a good day. I think I will work today.”  The sun and he rain do not feel like that. See the uncompounded within the compounded.</p><p class="P3">We have a personal character which dies when we die but life energy does not. Humans live best with a wide point of view, polishing themselves and seeing what is needed by all people, developing the character of an excellent person. Not just doing whatever someone feels like. A person may die, but what they have done stays on as a refuge for all people. The deep vow has no form. Our life has a measured time, but while we die, the true nature does not. In the excellent character, we find the uncompounded and its effects do not die. This is the wisdom we are offered.</p><p class="P1">16. If you are bodhisattvas, you should neither exhaust the conditioned nor abide in the unconditioned.</p><p class="P3">Each and everyone of us is a form that will die and change. And each person has ego. In this ego and this body have greed and anger and ignorance. And when we go all of it will be gone as well. Holding onto any of it has no purpose. Bodhisattvas who care for this world, do not take any aspects personally. </p><p class="P3">In general, people in society, work for their own satisfaction whereas bodhisattvas make use of everything for the awakening of all beings. At every step, we must throw everything away, seeing that the compounded is not different from the uncompounded. By deeply caring for all beings, we will not be toppled over by our ideals and can transform even our complaining into wisdom.</p><p class="P1">17.1. “What is it not to exhaust the conditioned? It is neither to transcend great sympathy nor to forsake great compassion, to profoundly generate the aspiration to achieve omniscience and never forget it even momentarily. It is to teach sentient beings without ever becoming tired, to be constantly mindful of following the teaching of the four attractions. It is to defend the correct Dharma without fear for one’s own life, to plant good roots without becoming fatigued.</p><p class="P1"> It is for one’s intent to always be on peaceful abiding and one’s skillful means rededicated [to anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi]. It is to seek the Dharma without tiring and explain the Dharma without parsimony, and to energetically make offerings to the buddhas.</p><p class="P3">And how do we liberate this world of the compounded when we are full of difficulties and differences, knowing that the world is full of delusion and phenomena?  If we try to do this mentally, it won’t work, but when we raise the vow to achieve liberation by caring deeply for every being’s deep mind will this world be seen clearly and given liberation. Wisdom is not dualistic. Our liberated character has no fixed form. </p><p class="P3">Humans are as Master Dogen has said a wisdomless lump of flesh at the beginning. We have to take this and look at it and make efforts to awaken. </p><p class="P3">Whent he Buddha was 80 years old he told his disciples that his body was like a creaky old cart and his disciple Ananda was astonished to hear this. Knowing the Buddha had infinite wisdom, Ananda had always felt that the Buddha would be infinite too,  Ananda was astonished and deeply preturbed.</p><p class="P3">The Buddha spoke to assure them, “You must find your refuge in yourself. Don’t look outside, you must find your refuge in the Dharma. Don’t look elsewhere. Polish this wisdom, and there is no end to the giving life and wisdom to all people. This is the Dharma. Do no turn to others. Turn within and turn to the Dharma.”  </p><p class="P3">Our wisdom has no form, so we learn that there is no fixed thing in existence. Everything is in flux. With this insight we guide the deepening of human character, bringing forth their wisdom and this is the way the compounded can become uncompounded.</p><p class="P3">Everyone doing sesshin is doing it for realizing the gate of the compounded and the uncompounded. At the beginning we can’t even sit 30 minutes but eventually we can realize the way of not having our ki go up into our head and keep it down in our tanden. We learn how to use this inconvenient body and realize how to enter samadhi.</p><p class="P3">In the beginning, we get desperate and the actuality of it is that it’s hard to simply breathe, our legs hurt, we want to be somewhere else, we are uncomfortable. We all live in a world of complaining and ignorance and we have to work through this and realize how to be in samadhi. Make efforts and receive everything that comes, and through that comes our ability to find a useful wisdom and see clearly how to live and use this life with this inconvenient physical body.</p><p class="P3">At first we are thinking all kinds of things, but that goes and we are able to realize that way of doing our work, being completely unaware that we are working, not being moved around by the pressures within and around us. The way of the Sixth Patriarch guides us in doing this. Do not give rise to thoughts about anything that you see and hear, and at the same time paying no attention to any thoughts that arises within.</p><p class="P3">For what are we doing sesshin? When we learn how to align our mind, we will not be moved around by those around us. It is not about being something that doesn’t see, doesn’t hear and doesn’t speak. We can’t make zazen into something that is mental. But we are so conditioned into thinking all the time that we need effort to align our breath and sustain our soft flexibility. We sit and become our sitting completely. We chant and become our chanting completely. We eat and we do our eating completely. We are able to not be moved around no matter what we are doing. This is zen and this is samadhi. </p><p class="P3">As people of old say when you play the shamisen you must play it not with your hands but with your empty-mind. Don’t play it with your hands, play it with the playing of it. What plays? We are not separated from the moving. This is the compounded becoming the uncompounded. We are playing but not even aware of it.</p><p class="P3">If we are self-consciously aware and play in such a way, the audience is not satisfied.   We are not yet able to do it, not yet able to do it, not quite yet able to do it. This is the compounded becoming the uncompounded. </p><p class="P3">The various paths, arts and sports all require the state of mind of not being moved around. The instruments, the techniques themselves are the compound. To not be moved around in the playing of them is uncompounded. And all of this wisdom is endless. It is without end because we are always reenergizing society when doing this. This is the base of the way of zazen. </p><p class="P3">There are different levels of people sitting in a dojo, some are beginners who have never sat a sesshin, some  have been sitting for decades. Another person may sit without budging, without moving an inch, while your own legs wanted to explode, they are in so much pain. Yet another person sits without budging and both are humans. So, use that person as a mirror and without letting the ki get high, get deeply serious. Follow each breath totally, completely, lose track of this body. </p><p class="P1">17.1. “What is it not to exhaust the conditioned? It is neither to transcend great sympathy nor to forsake great compassion, to profoundly generate the aspiration to achieve omniscience and never forget it even momentarily. It is to teach sentient beings without ever becoming tired, to be constantly mindful of following the teaching of the four attractions. It is to defend the correct Dharma without fear for one’s own life, to plant good roots without becoming fatigued.</p><p class="P3">Buddha is now teaching further in the teaching on the compounded and uncompounded, the endless teachings of the Mahayana. Not to be concerned only with ones own training, leaving society behind up in the quiet mountains, instead entering society training and practicing along with everyone else. </p><p class="P3">Training in society with charity, with compassion, doing it together and with practicing together all the time. Charity is offering to others. Compassion is using kind words, giving those words freely, encouraging others. Being willing to train along with others. This is how to perfect our practice and polish each other. To offer to all people, to keep that exchange of goodness going. </p><p class="P3">There are many ways we can give. Sometimes money or things we have on hand. If we have no money, no things to give, we can always give wisdom, charity, kindness. The wisdom of our own experience in realizing the truth is the infinite charity, whereas giving material things will always be limited. Wisdom is unending and that is what is most important. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha taught that we can always give a kind face, kind words, kind eyes. A kind peaceful face without angry mean eyes. Kind action. A kind abundant mind. A seat to someone instead of sitting down ourselves. A place to rest. These are the ways the Buddha taught to be charitable and to in that way train in society. This is the society we need to share and support. The offering of kind words is very important, especially for bringing someone to awakening.</p><p class="P3">In Zen, there is the special way of training about teaching words to be used with subtlety and wisdom. If the words are clear they can help another awaken. In human communication words are central. For  human kind, alive right now, compassionate words are so important. </p><p class="P3">To practice right along with everyone, clappers, bells,  rules, to sit supporting and supported by everyone, sitting across from each other, we also polish each other. Our intimacy then grows. To always live like this is the way of the bodhisattva. </p><p class="P1"> 17.2. “By doing so one will enter samsara without fear, be without sadness or joy regarding the various honors and disgraces, not belittle the unlearned and revere the learned as if they are buddhas, cause those who have fallen into the afflictions to generate correct mindfulness, distantly transcend pleasure and not consider it valuable, not be attached to one’s own pleasure yet celebrate the pleasure of others, have the concept that being in the dhyānas is like being in the hells, and have the concept that being in samsara is like being in a garden or pavilion.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti points out that to leave the world in order to find ourselves a quieter place and work in solitude is a hell realm. It is not about us pursuing our own preferences but to do what is best for all beings. Within this busy world find a quiet place inside without dividing oneself from society.</p><p class="P3">A bodhisattva has great courage, is a person of great mind, not just living for their own benefit. The way of the Buddha is clearly expressed in the words, “I have the true dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvana. The true form, the formless. In the subtle dharma gate independent of words transmitted beyond doctrine. This is what I have entrusted to Mahakasyapa.”  </p><p class="P3">Buddha had just taught the Lotus Sutra, teaching how all beings can be liberated. At that time the Gods of the heavens showered down flowers from the sky. The Buddha took and held up a flower, he said not a word. No one knew what to make of that, but Mahakasyapa simply smiled becoming one with the heavens and the earth. Just as this great sky receives all with no beginning and no ending, which holds all the stars, the great sky which has never died. </p><p class="P3">Within it, all beings come and go, again and again born into form and returning. Chanting a huge sky sutra, we wonder what will come, what will we get, what will happen if we sit zazen. We won’t become anything. We won’t get anything. We will let go of that need for self-satisfaction just like the sky and its four seasons, each with their own flowers and sceneries. As we all receive these changes within this huge mind, we narrow our scope and look for the meaning, but we are this huge sky, which gives life to all human kind. </p><p class="P1">“I have the true dharma eye the marvelous mind of Nirvana. The true form of the formless and the subtle dharma gate, independent of words, transmitted beyond doctrine. This I have entrusted to Mahakasyapa.”  </p><p class="P3">This is the truth for which we have to live or we stay caught on phenomena, moved around and crushed by  phenomena and appearances. We have to have a sharp huge mind or we cannot let go of attachment to phenomena. We really have to be life in the present–do this throughly  </p><p class="P3">Life is very short. Shakyamuni Buddha asked his disciples, “What do you think life is?”  And the first one said, “Life is very short, maybe just this one day.”  In this one day we never know what is going to happen. A war could come, a crisis could come, an earthquake could come. And the Buddha said, “You have understood the skin of the Dharma.”  </p><p class="P3">The second disciple said, “Life is very short. The time of a meal. Eating one meal, everyone coming together to sit down, suddenly, even a landslide could come and end the whole thing.”  To him the Buddha said, “You have understood the meat of the Dharma.”  </p><p class="P3">The third person said, “A single breath. With a single breath, we don’t even know if we will breathe in or out again.”  And to this person the Buddha said, “You have understood the marrow of the Dharma.”  People are so busy looking for external good fortune. We don’t even look within. Or even one day sooner we should be realizing this deepest truth of the Dharma. </p><p class="P3">Hearing the Dharma, to not waste a minute of it. This is what brings meaning to life, but a life of no Dharma truth is really empty. If we have a choice to hear and teach that truth in any means to take that choice.</p><p class="P3">For the Buddha, for 49 years after his deep awakening, he was teaching every single day until he died at Kushinagara. Bodhidharma taught until 140 in China, finally arriving after three attempts to cross the ocean. And Ganji Wajul came to Japan from China after seven attempts, during which he lost his sight. </p><p class="P3">The point is not to just to hear the words, the words are guides directing us to the living truth. In this way, in the Dhammapada, the Buddha teaches, “How rare it is in this world of life and death to be alive. How rare it is to be able in this world to hear the Dharma. How rare it is in this world to be able to practice the truth of this Dharma. And how rare it is in this world to be able to meet a true teacher.”  </p><p class="P3">Our life is very full of ups and downs. We succeed. We fail. We succeed. We fail. We get sad and miserable, but even then when we are so sad and miserable that we don’t want to live, remember the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas know that things cycle, that is never all only darkness. Even if we don’t know what will come be unmoved around by whatever arises. As when we’re sitting on a solid seat on a moving train, we watch the scenery go by in peace. But if our seat was poorly attached to the floor and shook about, we couldn’t experience that peace. </p><p class="P3">Our zazen is for this. Helping those who practice for the first time, not putting them down because they are insecure and don’t know how to practice. Instead guide them with patience. If we entertain pride and desires, purify them and   remember that we are only actually alive this very moment. Right here and right now. To do zazen, we just do zazen. To do cleaning, we just do cleaning. To do sutras, we just do sutras. Buddha dhama is this matter of having ongoing Clear mind moments. The ongoing Clear mind moments that allow us to not be moved around, to not be unfocused or pulled around by desires or extraneous thinking. </p><p class="P3">Offering every effort to society allows us to have no delusion about the purpose of our life. If we don’t know where we are going we often don’t know which train to get on. The firm goal of awakening all beings expresses our eternal life, with our whole life we serve from this vow. Others can see that and be inspired to do the same. So that person’s life is continued and passed onward to others. </p><p class="P3">We make daily efforts in aligning our way of life. Zazen is for this. Awakening to Buddha’s wisdom, we see clearly that this goal was not mistaken because it is experienced directly. Having no mistake, living without wasting our daily life. Living this way, the way of bodhisattva, we are not putting our own awakening first, rather the awakening of all the beings in the society is our goal. </p><p class="P3">If we put our own good fortune first, it is like throwing our life into hell. Samadhi settles our own mind and others also need to realize this deep state of mind of not being moved around by anything whatsoever. Doing sesshin we work together on that. </p><p class="P1">17.3. “One will have the concept that seeing one [a beggar] coming to make a request is like [seeing] an excellent teacher, have the concept that to forsake one’s various possessions is to be replete in omniscience, have the concept that to see transgressors is to generate salvific protection, </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti is not to be deluded by physical appearance when we are all at the origin, Buddha nature. Because we can be Buddha nature, if we can see that in others, we can see it in ourselves. If we can see it in ourselves, then we cannot be destroyed. See clearly and directly, this is our true nature. If we see that, we cannot see others as anything else. </p><p class="P3">Not to discriminate and always see true nature is most important. We must not be deceived by the various surroundings we find ourselves in, see the wisdom in all the situations we encounter. The trees are wisdom, the rock in the garden is wisdom,  the rain is wisdom. We can awaken just hearing the rain drop. Listen. We listen for awhile and we actually become that raindrop in its falling. Plop. Plop. This rain drop is also wisdom, it can bring forth our mind’s true understanding.</p><p class="P1">17.3. have the concept of the pāramitās (perfections) being one’s parents, and have the concept of the [thirty-seven] factors of enlightenment being one’s subordinates. One’s generation of practices and [planting of] good roots will be limitless. One will create one’s own buddha land with the various ornamentations of the pure countries [of different buddhas].</p><p class="P3">The way of life of a bodhisattva is the way of the six paramitas, of charity, of percepts, of giving everything, of strong efforts, of deep samadhi and of wisdom. These are all written on the boards in zendo. This  zen life is a way of living in samadhi, of  living a positive balanced life. This is why precepts are the second in that list of six after charity. Because precepts allow us to align our life to live in harmony with all beings. </p><p class="P3">we welcome all the people who come with many different kinds of pain, suffering and misery, we see them as our teachers instead of holding ourselves superior to them having something special we should be teaching them. Find joy in this opportunity to learn from others, not thinking of ourselves as someone who has attained something special. As it says in Bodhidharma’s ten severe precepts;</p><p class="P2">“If we think we have made some great efforts or if we think we have achieved some deep understanding, that is the same as thievery against the precept of do not steal. Do not think that we have received or experienced anything special whatsoever.”</p><p class="P3">See carefully how to be clear and know how to be careful concerning these ten evils becoming expressed in our behavior. Not doing things with our body such as, killing, stealing,  causing pain,  speaking hypocritically, putting people down, saying things that sound true but we know are not, being,  or being greedy or angry or ignorant. We can purify our body and mouth and our state of mind and this is very important. </p><p class="P3">In this way we can use our mind in a way that is positive for all things. Letting go of all kinds of selfishness and self-concerns we avoid a mistaken relationship with the mind, the body and the mouth.</p><p class="P3">Not being angry when we don’t get what we are greedy for, and do not be ignorant because we don’t really know what we want, but just greedily pursuing anything. When we align all of this then we purify our mouth, our body and our mind. Doing zazen we let go of the many thoughts that are coming and going. We purify our mind, body and mouth so that we can live in clarity. </p><p class="P3">We sit to bring forth this great courage, free of obstruction, we are able to then bring forth wisdom. Doing zazen, even a little, we separate from our usual self-centered behaviour. After sesshin,  it is not so easy to return to the world and not fall into the same trap. We have to live in society without fear, making efforts to not be moved around by things. We have done a week of osesshin, do not let it just end when we leave here. </p><p class="P3">In the “Entangled Vines” koan collection, there is the koan, “The badly behaving Bhikhu does not fall into hell. The pure minded monk does not enter nirvana.”  We have the teaching that we should extinguish all the flames of the passions. The flame of greed, the flame of anger, the flame of ignorance and then find the serenity of nirvana. But knowing that serenity of nirvana, do no just sit down in that way of being. Rather to go into the world with that state of mind. Yet, simultaneously to not move away from people who are not in that state of mind. Rather, do not mind any great effort it may take to care for their pain and suffering. Finding a deep way of solving our own pain and suffering as we see them as ourself. To penetrate what they experience deeply and see it as our own experience. </p><p class="P3">“The pure monk does not enter nirvana. The badly behaved bhikkhu does not go to hell.” [see Entangling Vines (26)] To not enter into nirvana is to stay in the world, right in the middle of all things. Working with everything we are in order to liberate other people. To ease the minds of others with no sense of being two different minds, not making a them and us,  we are not dividing things into the world of compounded and uncompounded. </p><p class="P1">17.4 “Practicing limitless charity, one will become replete in the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks. Eliminating all evil, one will purify one’s body, speech, and mind. </p><p class="P3">Here we have further teaching on the six paramitas, the ways of practice of the bodhisattvas as taught by the Buddha. First we have that of charity, then of that of precepts, of receiving everything, of making strong efforts, of entering samadhi and of  wisdom, the teaching of the Buddha. The fourth is making efforts. In every breath to give it everything, but whether we do that or not, breath itself continues naturally, whether we pay attention to it or not. </p><p class="P3">When we do zazen, our samadhi balances our whole system. To only walk when we walk, to only see when we see, to only hear when we hear, this focus keeps us settled and balanced. Too much thinking disturbs our samadhi. Not thinking anything at all, receive everything naturally,  everything we hear, see, experience, just simply and naturally. In this way, we do not have any extraneous mind moments coming in and out. When seeing then just see, not adding on any thoughts, if have mind moments then do not get caught on them. </p><p class="P3">Further we need to train to learn and to teach the Buddha’s wisdom to others. We need to do this deeply so it is a useful wisdom, and not only a mental knowledge. Today we have the East/West spiritual exchange started many years ago, this opportunity for people to learn by experiencing other’s religious practices. Because the universal easily is realized in any religion, being able to relate how it is expressed other religions is very important. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha’s wisdom is to teach the truth without hesitation. In the Blue Cliff Record there are many examples of this. One was once when a monk, a person of a heretical, a different path, came and asked the Buddha, “How was it possible to give a teaching about the truth, if we speak the words it’s not it, if we don’t speak the words at all that’s not yet it. So how can we express this truth?”  Struggling with how to do this he was asking from a real intense need to know how to go about it. The Buddha answered this person with silence. At this silence, the person prostrated and thanked him deeply for his excellent teaching. </p><p class="P1">17.4. “Practicing limitless charity, one will become replete in the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks. Eliminating all evil, one will purify one’s body, speech, and mind.</p><p class="P3">It is not about saying, “I’ve done this” or “I’ve done that.” To serve society is our  responsibility, but if we do it in a self-conscious way, and in a way that is praising ourselves and feeling that we are special in doing this, it is a big mistake. There is the saying, “To not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.”  To do things without this kind of a dualistic perception. Self-conscious awareness, thinking of ourselves as someone special. Instead for each and every person, to do whatever they can do with their own individual capabilities. </p><p class="P1">17.4. Being born and dying for countless kalpas, one will remain courageous [throughout]. Hearing of the immeasurable merits and intention of the buddhas, one will never become tired. With the sword of wisdom one will destroy the ‘bandits’ of the afflictions, and one will emerge from the skandhas, realms (dhātus), and entrances (āyatanas).</p><p class="P3">To perceive our own mistaken behavior is very important. Perceiving it and purifying it. We have the ten mistaken behaviors, the three of the body, the four of the mouth and the four of the mind. The three of the body to be violent and to hurt others and to kill physical things. The four of the mouth, to lie, to have falsehoods, to talk behind people’s back and to be hypocritical. The four of the mind, to be deceptive and to bring things into a way that is not how they actually are. To hold onto our pride, our greed, our anger, and our ignorance. These are the mistakes we do in our mind and all together this becomes ten mistaken behaviors. These are all resolved by purifying the way in which we live. By looking at it carefully and seeing what we are actually doing. </p><p class="P3">And while we do need our body, mind and mouth, to be able to liberate others, to be using it with responsibility and then to be spontaneous and natural in our way of being with other people. </p><p class="P1">17.5. “One will bear the burden of sentient beings and always make them become emancipated. With great exertion one will subjugate the armies of Māra. One will always seek the practice of wisdom of the real characteristic of no-mindfulness. One will know satisfaction through minimal desire regarding the worldly dharmas. One will seek the supramundane dharmas without tiring. Yet one will be able to accord with the profane, without either forsaking the worldly dharmas or breaking the deportments. One will generate the sagacity of numinous penetration and entice sentient beings [to salvation]. One will not forget what one has heard through the dhāraṇī of memory. One will discriminate well [between] those of the various capacities and eliminate the doubts of sentient beings. One will expound upon the Dharma without hindrance, taking pleasure in one’s eloquence. One will be pure in carrying out the ten types of good and experience the blessing of gods and humans. One will cultivate the four immeasurables and open up the path to the Brahmā heavens. One will exhort and request [others to] explain the Dharma and be accordingly joyous in praising its excellence.“</p><p class="P3">We have the words of the Buddha in the Dhammapada.; “How rare it is to be born as a human being. Yet we have been born a human being. How rare to be born as a human being in a world  with life and death and be alive. How rare it is to know that there is a Dharma teaching. And how rare it is to be able to have a true teacher of that Dharma teaching. “ </p><p class="P3">We continue through things that are painful and difficult. We become able to realize that this actuality of having a life of a human being is something that we have come to after a long long journey of evolution of many lifetimes. It is foolish to waste this precious life. It has taken such a long time and so much hard work to get here. Be this life, work therein and realize our true mind and offer our service to others. </p><p class="P3">Our conceptual dualistic mind is something we have developed after our birth. It is not everything we are, in fact it is a tiny point of our whole consciousness. Let go of the impurities of greed, anger and ignorance that limit our awareness. Let go of unnecessary thinking by realizing our pure and bright state of mind and develop the direct perception of prajna wisdom. </p><p class="P3">Like a candle that burns up its own body to give light to others. One candle giving light and setting another alight, and then another, until infinite candles can be set alight. Sharing our light we purify and bring amazement and joy to others, who therein bring further joy and amazement to others. In this way, the inexhaustible lamp works infinitely liberating all beings and living eternally. We limited beings can bring infinite light and infinite wisdom and the Mahayana  teaches us to work in this way.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti continues teaching the Dharma of the compounded and uncompounded, that way of seeing things as phenomena and being attached. Or that way of seeing them as transient from not being attached to them. If our eyes are free of attachment we can see the transient world just as it is. In all of its purity of our awareness, when it is pure, otherwise we get pulled all around, happy when praised or distressed when difficult things happen. Constantly tossed and turned, going back and forth, but if we see clearly, our eyes are unmoved around. In our zazen, if we are freed from our ego’s absorption we don’t get caught.</p><p class="P3">As the Sixth Patriarch had said so clearly, “To things that we perceive externally, to not add on any thoughts or ideas, and to not hold on to any of the deep concerns within.”  Adding no extra thoughts, clear about what we perceive. To be able to not give any thoughts of good or bad to what we perceive externally. We so often thing things are good, things are bad. What is good or bad about a tree that is growing in the garden, for example. But if something is in our way, we think its bad. </p><p class="P3">The mountain is simply a mountain. A river is simply a river. The moon is simply the moon. And the sun is simply the sun. There is nothing to be confused by here. The ocean is low just because an ocean is low. This is a rule of dualism. If we bring up dualistic thoughts, but if we don’t raise those thoughts and don’t get caught on them. </p><p class="P3">As the Sixth Patriarch has said, “To not add any thoughts or ideas onto what we perceive. And to let go of all the concerns within. Letting go of all those concerns within, if we don’t add on extra thoughts to what we perceive, and simply, only reflect things that happen exactly as they are, there is no need for thoughts of how this is good and this is bad. So many difficult things happen in the world all the time. But to just receive each world of each moment. And respond appropriately in each moment. </p><p class="P3">We are not mirrors. Neither are we without feelings. But to be receiving each moment without adding on complex ideas of how it was when I was small, or how this happened to me and that’s why this is going on in inside of me, past things are past and things that have not come yet are yet to come. Rather to receive precisely exactly what is right at hand and respond appropriately therein. </p><p class="P3">Not to add on one’s own position and one’s own stance about these things. If we add on all of those thoughts and opinions, everything is confusing. If we hold nothing extra in our mind we can see it as it is, a phenomena. To not add on any ideas or thoughts that we experience and perceive externally and to not to hold on to any of the concerns within. We can respond appropriately in that world of phenomena, and in responding that way we can receive both the compounded and the uncompounded without attachment to any of it. See this clearly, doing our zazen we might ignore surroundings or give them exaggerated attention, but rather than that just be with things exactly as they are. </p><p class="P3">At the time of the great east earthquake in Japan, people lost homes, they lost whole businesses. They lost dreams. They lost all their hopes. Everything sudden was pulled right out from under them. As a result people lost all motivation and became like ghosts unable to respond to anything. This happened to so many when all of their good fortune was suddenly taken away. They lost the desire to live, without energy or motivation to think about starting all over again. </p><p class="P3">But our practice is to take it all in and not to despair. Somehow to make a new start regardless of how we see others react whatever we imagine we understand of them. Each day, each moment to start once again. This is the state of mind of the Mahayana, standing within our deepest faith, and no matter what happens use that instead as a new departure. </p><p class="P3">In this world people are so varied in the  ways they live their lives. Some are satisfied and living well with abundant material things, but some are impoverished and suffering deeply. Living is not about only protecting ones’ comforts and interests, instead clearly see situations . Live in a way where we can appreciate and participate with others. Wherever you are live in accordance with what is best for everyone, not just holding on to your own preferences or style of living. </p><p class="P3">Zen does not concern itself with supernatural powers, instead, direct attention to what is natural such as seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling. Be without attachment to what is perceived, make efforts toward this. See  objectively in each and every situation and have an open, Clear mind. Thereby perceive all things clearly and accurately, not ignoring what people tell us, but understanding what others are going through in their lives and help them unravel their entangled questions and confusions. </p><p class="P3">Having irresistible speech by acquiring unimpeded eloquence. To be able to enjoy teaching people and speaking to them from understanding of the truth. Tasting human and divine success by purifying the path of ten virtues. Living in a way of purifying our unskillful behavior, of body, mouth and mind, the challenges that we have in our difficult ways to come up with our body, the ten different ways of body, mouth and mind. To live with an abundant state of mind so others have no fear from our words and behavior. If people fear and become insecure, then they are not able to see things clearly as phenomena. </p><p class="P1">17.5. One will cultivate the four immeasurables and open up the path to the Brahmā heavens.</p><p class="P3">The Four Immeasurable Treasures are often taught in the Vimalakirti Sutra. To help take away painful feelings and offering kindness and wisdom in society. Easing another’s pain and giving them wisdom and joy.</p><p class="P3">Then we have letting go, releasing unnecessary physical habits, throwing away our mental attachments and misguided beliefs. It is not just objects that are to be released, we undertake an endless throwing away of anything we hold on to and don’t need. This is also included in the immeasurables. As Vimalakirti is always teaching:  </p><p class="P1">“Establishing the path of the pure states of Brahma by cultivating the four immeasurables; inviting the Buddhas to teach the Dharma.”</p><p class="P1">17.5. One will cultivate the four immeasurables and open up the path to the Brahmā heavens. One will exhort and request [others to] explain the Dharma and be accordingly joyous in praising its excellence. </p><p class="P3">When we realize this state of mind it’s easier for us to see things as transient phenomena. To know what is best for each person we must see the different ways beings can react to the same thing. Remembering the saying that when someone claps their hands by the lake  the fish come thinking they are going to be fed. Hearing the clapping,  the bird flies away being surprised. And in the nearby tea shop they prepare to serve tea thinking somebody has arrived. Just clapping hands, yet how different are the reactions. </p><p class="P1">17.6. Attaining the Buddha’s voice, one will be good in [acts of] body, speech,  and mind. Attaining the deportments of the Buddha, one will profoundly cultivate the good qualities, with one’s practice becoming increasingly excellent. With the Mahayana teaching, one will become a bodhisattva monk. Without mental laxity, one will not fail in the host of goods. Practicing a Dharma such as this, one is called ‘a bodhisattva who does not exhaust the conditioned.’ </p><p class="P3">People can gather experience giving life to teachings and not just having ideas and mental inclinations about what they say. Use every occasion possible to cultivate every person’s good qualities.</p><p class="P1">18. “What is a bodhisattva who does not abide in the unconditioned? “It is to cultivate [the emancipation of the] empty without taking the empty as one’s realization. It is to cultivate [the emancipations of] signlessness and wishlessness without taking the signless and the wishless as one’s realization. </p><p class="P3">Not resting in the uncompounded, practice the truth of holding onto nothing whatsoever. As the Sixth Patriarch has said in his definition of zazen, of the ‘za’ part, ‘to not give any thoughts or ideas or judgments to external perceptions. Of the ‘zen’ part he says do not hold onto any concerns within. The Sixth Patriarch is not saying there are two separate worlds, an inside one and an outside one. But just as a mirror can reflect everything precisely because it has no face of its own. When we are not caught on a small self, only then does everything become our own face. </p><p class="P2">“In all the boundless realms of space and in the place between self and other, not a single thing can be inserted. <br/>From the furthest past to the limitless future, we have never separated from this very moment.” <span class="T1"> </span></p><p class="P3">With this is a koan [see Entangling Vines (214)]we realize how we are perfectly matched in oneness to every single thing and moment that we experience the not holding on to an idea of who we are, then everything is all one truth. As our zazen ripens, this is how it becomes. </p><p class="P3">As the Sixth Patriarch said in his definition of the ‘zen’ of zazen, we have to let go of all of our concerns within, then we can perceive clearly and precisely. We are one with each and every thing and are not moved around by any of it. Our concepts and our positions obstruct this freedom and our zazen removes these. </p><p class="P3">We cannot do zazen as only an outward form just the phenomena, instead it has to be with inner depth and in all the four activities of the day, whether standing, sitting. sleeping or waking. Not just sitting on the cushion and being still in a posture of zazen. Our most basic zazen is not to carry around extra things in our mind. But we have lived for so long in this world that we are accustomed to being moved around by concepts. We need to just let go of our conditioned way of doing and being. In the beginning it will take effort but then it becomes natural. </p><p class="P3">Daito Kokushi himself said it took him 30 years to get rid of that stench of dualism. Daito Kokushi realized that everything was phenomena and it took 30 more years to see clearly how that is true in every situation. We also, have to have direct experience of this. Experience this deeply and not just leave it at a superficial tasting of a flavor. Instead, without leaking outward from our senses to ‘see’ deeply what is actual in each and every moment. Whether it is standing, sitting, sleeping or waking, to become  mu completely in every single one of 360 smallest bones and our 84,000 hair pores. </p><p class="P3">If we give away our attention and lose our awareness, then we are indulging in fuzziness in our thoughts, and that is not zazen. We have to focus our awareness into oneness. Seeing as if we are seeing looking down from a huge mountain top very far up high, far away and seeing everything below it. Experience that deepest state of mind or we stay deluded. To not be moved around by anything at all. </p><p class="P3">See and live fully and clearly , don’t just sit down on a partial realization of something. We have to directly experience it and see that there is not one bit of obstruction to continuing in that state of mind. When we die completely, without fail we are reborn completely. We have to throw away any idea of even having thrown something away. This needs deep determination and passion, we are doing this to realize within, but if we are caught on an idea of there being a difference between within and without then we cannot see clearly.</p><p class="P3">No matter of what is being giving attention, it’s important to not divide into that which is focusing and that which is being focused on. Otherwise, we are always seeing a lingering shadow of our awareness. Each and everyone of us realize that all-embracing state of mind and see that everything of form is phenomena. Clearly see the importance of zazen and don’t waste this precious opportunity.</p><p class="P1">18. “What is a bodhisattva who does not abide in the unconditioned? “It is to cultivate [the emancipation of the] empty without taking the empty as one’s realization. It is to cultivate [the emancipations of] signlessness and wishlessness without taking the signless and the wishless as one’s realization. </p><p class="P3">A temple was almost always in the mountains in China so it’s gate was called a mountain gate. But in fact what is pointed to by this expression, mountain gate, are these three facets of emptiness, that of void, no form and no sign. The Diamond Sutra express this “no form” is this way:</p><p class="P2">Thus shall ye think of all this fleeting world. <br/>A star at dawn, <br/>a bubble in a stream, <br/>a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, <br/>a flickering lamp, a phantom, a dream.</p><p class="P3">We know these words well, that in this fleeting world everything we encounter is transient. Yet this world appears to exist does it not?  We have a borrowed body that appears to exist, yet this is not a single body, it is billions of cells which are interconnected replenishing themselves with each other. This highlights that being alive after all is void. </p><p class="P3">Our forgetting ourselves completely is a matter of course. We ae always moving, we don’t work in one position, or in one location. We are not fixed objects, we are all naturally moving and changing. If we look closely any ‘it’, it expresses this same void and no shape is self-existing and no signs point to unchanging things. We can see the sharp sword of the Buddha’s wisdom if we see how we are all without form and without sign and void. </p><p class="P1">“It is to cultivate [the emancipation of the] empty without taking the empty as one’s realization. It is to cultivate [the emancipations of] signlessness and wishlessness without taking the signless and the wishless as one’s realization.”</p><p class="P3">Master Bankei used the expression, ‘the unborn’ to point to this. All of the teachings that are given in the Heart Sutra; being without birth, without death, how this world is like a mirror which simply reflects, these are the unborn, and this is how our mind is. Our true unborn state of mind simply reflects and does not grasp and does not act.</p><p class="P1">It is to cultivate nonactivation without taking nonactivation as one’s realization. </p><p class="P3">Bankei Zenji teaches the unborn is like a mirror. It has no function, it is not a something which is acting. No matter what a clean or dirty thing is reflected, the mirror does not get soiled. It is just like a baby who is not yet thinking creatively, who simply receives every sensation from the world, not yet putting its own impulses and ideas onto everything.</p><p class="P3">Whereas an older person can sympathize, as we grow we empathize with others and appropriately connect to each person we meet. First we perceive like a baby and then as we deepen we can see what it is that needs doing in each situation. We see clearly what is going on in society, what suffering is for people and what causes suffering. </p><p class="P1">“It is to contemplate impermanence without having aversion for the roots of goodness.”</p><p class="P3">When we know this impermanence of everything we are not moved around by those dynamics, but simultaneously see everything is changing and in process. We are not attached to  impermanence or the changes we undergo. We appreciate each encounter however brief, and hold precious that moment in order to make best use of this opportunity which may not come again. Seeing this closely, we go to every length to appreciate and remember that moment. We weave those karmic affiliations when we meet someone in this way.</p><p class="P1">18. It is to contemplate worldly suffering without considering samsara evil. It is to contemplate no-self while teaching people without tiring. </p><p class="P3">Knowing that this world holds the miseries of aging, sickness, parting and loss, and seeing this we know that this is our reality. Knowing how important this life is and we must not waste it. What a rare opportunity to be a human. What a rare opportunity to be in this world of life and death and yet be alive. So we make efforts to share our wisdom and to not underestimate the worth of even one small, fleeting existence.</p><p class="P3">To know and seek ease while knowing that everything is transient. To experience pain and to see that is temporary. Because we see the transience of both the pleasure and the pain, we don’t get attached to either. Rather, we make efforts to forget ourselves completely in whatever we are doing and then we can learn wisdom. If we are able to see that our mental activity is only a gathering of data and information, we can see how awareness has no substance. If we can see that, then even if somebody insults us, we don’t get upset, and when somebody praises us we don’t get overjoyed about it. Instead, see that there is no thing that experiences getting angry and no thing experiences being pleased. </p><p class="P3">In the world, we only appear to exist and our mind is not something only ever pure. It is  transient and always changing. We see how there is nothing therein to hold onto. And  awakening to not being attached, we see that while the Buddha Nature  has been realized, we can’t sit down on that either. We have to keep  living a life that expresses our clear awareness and realization. </p><p class="P3">We see that we have to awaken even further now to that deepest wisdom right now. Give that wisdom to those that are suffering and struggling and in that way to do even the slightest possible thing in the world that we can do to offer it to people in society. This is how life is. Not to get caught on being in flux but to use the chances and capabilities that we have. </p><p class="P3">We have been born, so to awaken to the greatest amount of wisdom possible and then to be able to share that with people we see who are seeing things through a twisted awareness and to straighten that out with them. And see the world of pain and peace through eyes of one who can see and who’s understood a level of truth and not stay affected by these transient aspects. But if we look through clear eyes, we can see that every single thing in existence is precious. Yet to neither get caught or attached from those eyes seeing in that way. Only to see how precious and yet still how transient they are.</p><p class="P1">It is to contemplate transcendence while cultivating the good with mind and body. “It is to contemplate the absence of any refuge while going for refuge in the dharmas of goodness. It is to contemplate the birthless, yet to bear the burden for all [sentient beings] using the dharmas of birth. It is to contemplate the flawless, yet not eliminate the flaws. It is to contemplate the absence of any practice, yet to teach sentient beings using the dharmas of practice. It is to contemplate emptiness and nonexistence, yet not to forsake great compassion. It is to contemplate the position of the correct Dharma, yet not to follow the Hinayana.</p><p class="P3">To know the serenity of the truth, we use this way of extinguishing the flames of greed,  the flames of anger, and the flames of ignorance,. With only a mind full of attachments, we can’t see clearly.</p><p class="P1">It is to contemplate no-self while teaching people without tiring.</p><p class="P3">We only sit for one week in sesshin, but we make efforts to see clearly the wisdom in our state of mind and offer it to everyone. Then we are able to bring that wisdom into a larger arena that people can share this and know it well. </p><p class="P1">18.2. “It is to contemplate the empty falsity of the dharmas, which are without solidity, without selfhood, without subject, and without characteristic. It is not to consider merit, meditation, and wisdom to be in vain when one’s original vow has not been fulfilled. Practicing a Dharma such as this, one is called ‘a bodhisattva who does not abide in the unconditioned.’</p><p class="P3">Do not get caught on physical appearances and be attached to them. Instead, we endlessly open our wisdom. Just as Master Rinzai has taught us that we are alive and in every step we take we are never separate from our Clear mind. Thoroughly absorbed in this one step right now, we live in endless time. As the poem says:</p><p class="P2">This autumn, we don’t know how the harvest will be<br/>We could lose everything, yet we don’t miss a chance to help our neighbor pulling their weeds.</p><p class="P1">19. “Furthermore, in order to be complete in merit one should not abide in the unconditioned; and in order to be complete in wisdom one should not exhaust the conditioned.</p><p class="P1">“In order to [achieve] great sympathy and compassion, one should not abide in the unconditioned; in order to fulfill one’s original vow, one should not exhaust the conditioned. In order to accumulate the medicines of the Dharma, one should not abide in the unconditioned; in order to bestow medicines according [to the needs of sentient beings], one should not exhaust the conditioned. In order to understand the illnesses of sentient beings, one should not abide in the unconditioned; in order to extinguish the illnesses of sentient beings, one should not exhaust the conditioned. O good sirs, a bodhisattva who cultivates this Dharma does not either exhaust the conditioned or abide in the unconditioned. This is called ‘the teaching of the emancipation of the exhaustible and inexhaustible.’ You should learn this.”</p><p class="P3">When we see peace we want to keep it that way, and with our efforts we work to achieve this. To live without a vow is the greatest mistake for a practitioner of the bodhisattva path. We cannot live without reviewing our behavior and see what is the best way for us to improve our behaviour. Use this opportunity to bring this great life energy into our life. </p><p class="P3">See that all views are in fact borrowed and do not be attached to them and concerned about results. Don’t be caught melancholy but see that mind that has no form and no substance. Develop this empty mind to bring forth wisdom and give joy to each and every person. Forget oneself and offer everything to others.</p><p class="P3">Never stop these efforts to do zazen and to train, along with everyone else in society. As Vimalakirti teaches the central theme of the sutra, “The world is sick and therefore I am sick.”  Sentient beings are numberless, never stop helping others with our greatest caring wisdom. This is Vimalakirti’s great gift of energy, use it and vow to bring everyone true peace and wisdom. Becoming and realizing this wisdom and energy ourselves so that we can bring it to all people.</p><p class="P3">As we dig into our roots of wisdom, we continue to help others do the same. We all have an innate bright mind. We all have to find, realize and use this bright mind and make use of everything possible from within to help those who are suffering through their attachments. We  know that our ego is the source of this attachment, share this wisdom and understanding so all can work at liberating, this great Dharma is taught for all the bodhisattvas .</p><p class="P1">20. When those bodhisattvas heard the explanation of this Dharma they were all extremely happy, and they scattered hosts of wondrous flowers of several colors and fragrances throughout the trimegachiliocosm, making offerings to the Buddha, this teaching, and the bodhisattvas [of this world]. They bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet and exclaimed at this unprecedented [teaching], saying, “Śākyamuni Buddha is able to perform the skillful means of this excellent practice in this [world].” Saying this, they suddenly disappeared, returning to that other country.</p><p class="P3">Finally at the end of this section we have the bodhisattvas saying goodbye. Giving thanks since they have no verbal teachings in their universe. Instead they are imbued with wisdom and awakening by through the wonderous fragrances where they live. Acknowledging that we cannot rest on our understanding, we have to teach and offer it to all others. These bodhisattvas offered flowers of all colors and fragrances to the Buddha and his disciples and thanked him for his deep teaching extolling what a great Buddha is Shakyamuni Buddha who he teaches in a way that anyone can understand. </p><p class="P3">To awaken to the truth and give it to all beings everywhere. This is the state of mind of the bodhisattva and of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
