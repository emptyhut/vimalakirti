At that time the Elder Vimalakīrti thought to himself, “I am lying sick in bed. How can the World-honored One, He of Great Sympathy, not take pity on me?”</p><p class="P4">2. Knowing what [Vimalakīrti] was thinking, the Buddha immediately told Śāriputra, “Go visit Vimalakīrti and inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P2">Since Vimalakirti was resting and ill, the Buddha spoke to his disciples, asking them to go and pay a visit. All of his top disciples refused the request. They all had excuses, “A long time ago I had this difficult experience with Vimalakirti. If I now go casually to visit him, he will, on the contrary, get angry at me, and I don’t think that will fulfill the purpose of going to visit him on his sickbed.” Each and every one had a different excuse, and each refused to go. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti is spoken of with great praise, as is Mahayana Buddhism — giving a clear picture of the state of Mind taught in the Mahayana through these stories. Since all of the Vimalakirti Sutra is a skillful fiction, all of the Buddha’s top disciples are painted in the worst possible light. They are, in other words, used as grist for the advertisement of Mahayana Buddhism. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti was sleeping on the bed in his room, and suddenly he thought, “Certainly the Buddha has seen that I am lying here sick in bed. He has probably felt bad about it and asked someone to come and visit in his place. This is what Vimalakirti suddenly thought to himself. That state of Mind, just as it was, the Buddha heard directly. From very far away he knew Vimalakirti’s state of Mind, and he responded immediately by first calling Shariputra. At this point, we see mind-to-mind communication and how it functions.</p><p class="P2">The first person brought onto the scene here is the main disciple of greatest wisdom, Shariputra Sonja. Shariputra Sonja’s mother was named Shari-she was truly sagacious and had beautiful clear eyes like an egret—a very clever woman— and because he was the son of a woman like this he was named Shariputra, or son of Shari. He was the most brilliant and wise of the Buddha’s top disciples. </p><p class="P2">Shariputra Sonja and Mokkuren Sonja, the next one who appears in the text, were the most intimate of friends. The two of them were teachers from the young age of sixteen, and each had a following of 500 people or more. While having such groups learning from them, they both felt that if they were to meet someone who was superior to them in understanding, they would further polish their minds with that person. They both also promised to tell each other and introduce them to such a person. </p><p class="P2">One day when Shariputra Sonja was walking in the city of Oshajo, he saw <span class="indexTerm">Rassetsu ni</span>, one of the Buddha’s first five disciples from the deer forest.  Rassetsu ni was walking in simple patched clothing, yet with the patches well cleaned and cared for.  He had a peaceful face, harmonious and free of conflict, and with an easy equilibrium expressed in it. Shariputra stopped Rassetsu ni and asked, that kind and peaceful countenance of yours—what kind of teaching are you learning from that brings you such a peaceful expression?  From what great teaching have you been able to realize such a radiant face? He asked him this question and was told that he was the disciple of Shakyamuni.  Shariputra repeated the name and said “Shakyamuni — I haven’t heard this name before. Who is he? Shakyamuni — Shakyamuni, what kind of teaching does he give?”</p><p class="P2">“He teaches the law of cause and effect—that all of the ten thousand things in this world are born from cause and effect and from cause and effect they again die. In all existence there is no such thing as ego.” Hearing this, Shariputra jumped up in surprise. Until this time, all religions were based on a god and leaned on this god to save them; this was the usual teaching. But Shakyamuni was teaching that we are not created by a god, but that all things come forth from cause and effect and fade away from cause and effect; all things, all existence never departs from this framework—a truly rational teaching. Hearing this, Shariputra said-“I have never ever heard a teaching such as this before.” He was greatly impressed and immediately told his friend Mokkuren Sonja. Mokkuren Sonja and Shariputra Sonja then led their disciples to become disciples of the Buddha, and from that time forward the Buddha became the teacher of 1,000 disciples. In this way, Shariputra Sonja had become a disciple of the Buddha and the Buddha now requested him to go and visit Vimalakirti. </p><p class="P4">Śāriputra addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. </p><p class="P4">Why? I remember once in the past, when I was sitting in repose beneath a tree. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P4">3. “‘O Śāriputra, you need not take this sitting [in meditation] to be sitting in repose. Sitting in repose is to not manifest body and mind in the triple world—this is sitting in repose. To generate the concentration of extinction while manifesting the deportments—this is sitting in repose. Not to relinquish the Dharma of enlightenment and yet manifest the affairs of [ordinary] sentient beings—this is sitting in repose. To have the mind neither abide internally nor locate itself externally—this is sitting in repose. To be unmoved by the [sixty-two mistaken] views yet cultivate the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment—this is sitting in repose. Not to eradicate the afflictions yet enter into nirvana—this is sitting in repose.</p><p class="P4">“‘Those who are able to sit in this fashion [will receive] the Buddha’s seal of approval.’</p><p class="P2">Being asked to do this Shariputra says, “I would go see anyone but Vimalakirti. I just don’t want to go see him. There’s a reason for why I feel like this. A long time ago, I was sitting in the woods doing zazen quietly and alone. At that time Vimalakirti came walking along and said to me, “You sit there and look as if you’re doing something good. Isn’t your sitting just a form? Is your mind also peaceful? If your zazen is only a quiet sitting form, the stone Jizo Bodhisattva is way ahead of you. You must go beyond all the ten thousand things and even your own body. To not leave behind a single speck of anything: it has to be this state of mind, or it can’t be considered real zazen,” said Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P2">To sit in the zendo, having come for training, people who have just come and those who have been here for ten or fifteen years—their external form looks the same. But for a person who is just beginning—whether it is a koan or the sussokan they’re practicing—just to sit their body down in the zendo and do the practice takes everything they have.  To then try to align their breath and keep their breathing going with concentration is beyond what is possible for them at this point. </p><p class="P2">After a while, when their bodies are accustomed to sitting there, the zendo becomes a place where they can concentrate. However, outside of the zendo, the work of concentrating on the breath is still difficult. One can concentrate in the zendo, but keeping sussokan going while doing samu or daily work is nearly impossible. When doing samu the sussokan seems to go somewhere else, and they ask what to do about that problem—this question always comes up. Of course this is the case because the sussokan (or the koan) is being produced self-consciously; the self-conscious attention becomes separated from the sussokan breathing’s attention and the work-or the koan and the work-if one tries to hold on to both it becomes very difficult-we don’t have two pockets in our Mind, we only have one pocket—no, in fact there are no pockets. There is only meeting the world as it encounters each thing, matching perfectly and touching it directly.</p><p class="P2">This is how it has to be or it doesn’t work right. If it is being done self-consciously—no matter what work is being done—it is at the beginning cumbersome and unskillful. Still, if we do it wholeheartedly from the beginning with all of our intensity, then little by little—even if we don’t think about it in a complicated way—our body naturally dives in and enters into that world. In this way, the koan or sussokan begins to work. While we hold it as a separate thing it stays difficult, but when it becomes our own life energy that is used to clear out extraneous thoughts, then this important point can be felt and understood, and in each moment and place the match is perfect with what we are doing. Our Mind’s functional simplicity becomes familiar and we can do it without complicated thought processing. It may look the same from the outside, but the inner essence of it is different. </p><p class="P2">In our mind, there is no extra tightness and tension—if that which is directly in front of us is in it’s correct focus, we will then, of course, become able to do this. The essence of the practice has to become full and taut to this extent or you can’t say that one is able to do real zazen. If we are able to do this, we will then begin to ask: is sitting in the zendo like a stone or flower—without seeing and without hearing—is this really zazen? This would be a natural question. It’ is not so. No matter how long we sit, after 5 or 6 hours we have to eat something, we have to go to the bathroom, our body is all cramped and we have to move around.  Even if we were to become able to sit without seeing or hearing it would only be up to that point. It would be limited, and that is not real zazen. It’s not like that. </p><p class="P2">Real zazen is settled, and no matter where we are and what we are doing we don’t put in extra thoughts about this and that. At each moment and in each place we are in the right place with our mind in equilibrium—this is zazen. It is not about purposely carrying around a sussokan practice or a koan in our heads—that is not the real zazen. If our koan is necessary, that is to work on our eye—it has to come alive in that. </p><p class="P2">The sussokan is used for the movement of our feet, the action of our body—in that the sussokan has to come alive. If not that, then it’s limited zazen and creative and inventive efforts will soon come to an end. That which has a beginning and an end is the world of delusion. No matter how long we practice it, our mind will not find true peace and equilibrium. </p><p class="P2">We do zazen, but if we aren’t careful we begin to think of zazen and life in society as two separate things. If we return to our usual place of living, our state of mind of zazen has been left behind and faded away.  We see our friends and go into town and our state of mind of zazen disappears. That is not the meaning of true zazen. No matter how much we talk to friends and no matter how much we walk around in town, within that our Mind must always find that place where it can return to—that place of no stain whatsoever. This must always be worked on creatively and inventively. This essence mustn’t be let go of or it’s not real zazen. </p><p class="P4">4. “At the time, World-honored One, I simply listened to this explanation in silence and was unable to respond. Therefore, I cannot accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">Mahāmaudgalyāyana</p><p class="P4">5. The Buddha told Mahāmaudgalyāyana, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P4">Maudgalyāyana addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past, I had entered the great city of Vaiśālī and was explaining the Dharma to the retired scholars of a certain neighborhood. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P4">6. “‘O Mahāmaudgalyāyana, when you explain the Dharma to white-robed retired scholars, you should not explain it as you are now doing. In explaining the Dharma, you should explain according to the Dharma.</p><p class="P4">“‘The Dharma is without sentient beings because it transcends the defilements of sentient beings; the Dharma is without self because it transcends the defilements of self; the Dharma is without lifespan because it transcends birth and death (samsara); and the Dharma is without person because it eradicates the threshold between previous and subsequent [moments].</p><p class="P4">“‘The Dharma is permanently serene because it extinguishes the characteristics; the Dharma transcends characteristics because it is without conditions; the Dharma is without names because it eradicates words; the Dharma is without explanation because it transcends discursive thought and reasoning; the Dharma is without the characteristics of form because it is like space; the Dharma is without hypotheses because it is ultimately empty; the Dharma is without the sense of personal possession because it transcends personal possession; the Dharma is without discrimination because it transcends the consciousnesses; and the Dharma is incomparable because there is nothing to match it; the Dharma is divorced from causation because it is not located in conditionality.</p><p class="P4">“‘The Dharma is identical to Dharma-nature because it inheres in the dharmas; the Dharma accords with suchness because it is without anything that accords with it; the Dharma abides in the actual because it is unmoved by the extremes; the Dharma is motionless because it is not dependent on the six types of sensory data; and the Dharma is without past and future because it is constantly nonabiding.</p><p class="P4">“‘The Dharma concurs with emptiness, accords with the absence of characteristics, and responds to inactivity. The Dharma transcends good and ugly, the Dharma is without gain and loss, the Dharma is without generation and extinction, and the Dharma is without refuge. The Dharma surpasses eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high and low, the Dharma abides constantly without moving, and the Dharma transcends all practices of contemplation.</p><p class="P4">7. “‘O Mahāmaudgalyāyana, with characteristics such as these, how can the Dharma be explained? Explaining the Dharma should be without explaining and without indicating. Listening to the Dharma should be without listening and without attaining.</p><p class="P4">“‘It is like a magician explaining the Dharma to conjured people.</p><p class="P4">8. “‘One should have such a mindset in explaining the Dharma; one should comprehend that the faculties of sentient beings [include both] sharp and dull. You would do well to be without hindrance in your knowledge and vision. Use the mind of great compassion and praise the Mahayana. Remember to recompense the kindness of the Buddha and do not cut off the Three Jewels. Thus should you explain the Dharma.’</p><p class="P4">9. “When Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, eight hundred retired scholars generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. I lack this eloquence. Therefore I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">Mahākāśyapa</p><p class="P4">10. The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P2">In today’s chapter, the disciple Makakasho Sonja [Mahakasyapa] is the one being requested to go and call on Vimalakirti. He is called Kasha Sonja and also Makakasho or Great Kasho. This particular disciple of the Buddha is very famous, and as everyone knows, it was to him that the Buddha’s Dharma was transmitted. He was the Buddha’s top disciple. He was older than the Buddha and had already been a teacher of a different sect. But when he heard the Buddha’s teaching he threw everything else aside and became his disciple. </p><p class="P2">The ten top disciples each had their own very particular character. Makakasho Sonja was considered to be the one who had cut all attachments to clothes and living places, food and other belongings. He had thoroughly separated from all of this, and by receiving alms and having no possessions he lived purely and simply. He lived in perfect satisfaction with whatever he received. He swept away all of the dust of desires that rose in his heart and extraneous thoughts that arose in his mind; he lived a truly pure, desire-free life. </p><p class="P2">Our true undivided Source—that clear mind which is the base of all things—Makakasho Sonja lived in accordance with this. To be able to do that completely as the way we live every day, we have to entrust our body for years to the practice that allows us to let go of these desires and this clutter. We have to decrease this delusion to the point of having as little of it as possible. </p><p class="P2">For this reason we need the kind of practice that Makakasho Sonja did. This kind of practice has ten main points. The first is to live in as quiet a place as possible. The second is to not accumulate your own food, but to receive it from society by receiving alms. That alms receiving should never be based on who is rich or poor but—not being dualistic about it—one should go to all people equally to ask for alms. The third is to live on two meals a day, if at all possible, to be eaten before noon. The contents should be only enough to keep us from being very hungry, and after lunch not drinking or eating anything but water, not even fruit juice and no solids at all. </p><p class="P2">The clothes to be worn are to be those which people have thrown away, well-washed and mended, but not what people usually buy at the store, wearing what we are given as offerings. Everyday clothes and ceremonial clothes, nothing should be owned but these. When traveling one should not sleep under a roof or in a comfortable bed but should instead sleep in a graveyard or under a tree. For doing zazen, one should not make a special place for sitting, but rather sit outside near the water, and one should never lay down. What this meant was to live the most simple and basic life never seeking comforts or possessions. Truly severe—each and every day was lived in just supporting that day’s life and not being attached to things—to every day teach our bodies to realize this.  This disciple completely realized this way of life.</p><p class="P4">Kāśyapa addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P2">The Buddha had even given one half of his own seat for this top disciple—something he never did for anyone else. This showed how thoroughly this disciple’s practice was done. When the Buddha held out the flower, it was Makakasho who smiled, and to him the Dharma was transmitted. The Buddha said at that time: “This True Dharma Eye, the marvelous Mind of Nirvana, the True Form of the Formless, and the Subtle Dharma Gate, independent of words and transmitted beyond doctrine, I now entrust to Makakasho.” </p><p class="P2">This is a profound moment in the passing along of the Dharma, where he was confirming Makakasho Sonja’s deep understanding and clarity of truth. This is the Kasho Sonja we are talking about here—he could even function in the Buddha’s place. Because this Vimalakirti Sutra is an advertisement for Mahayana Buddhism, we have many parts that are like this. Even such an excellent disciple as Makakasho Sonja was used as an advertisement. Kasho Sonja also said, “I really can’t raise my head at all in front of Vimalakirti, so I turn down this request.” He was then asked why he was turning it down and he gives his reason. </p><p class="P4">“Why? I remember once in the past, when I was begging in a poor neighborhood, Vimalakīrti came and said to me…”</p><p class="P2"> This was in India—perhaps most people wouldn’t consider taking alms from impoverished people, but when we consider that people believed that their past life has influenced how they now live—that this life is impoverished because they didn’t give enough to society—we can see it in a different light. In order to be reborn into a good household, to make an offering to an even less fortunate person would mean a gathering of virtue. For this they would go there for takuhatsu. When Vimalakirti saw this, he said to Makakasho:</p><p class="P4">11. “‘O Mahākāśyapa, you have the mind of sympathy and compassion but are unable [to apply it] universally. You have abandoned the wealthy to beg from the poor.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakrti says to Makakasho that you come here to this slum and attempt to make a karmic connection for them—this is a wonderful thing to do and is certainly coming from your deep compassion—but if you are truly compassionate, that must be a compassion of equality. I understand your idea and your compassionate way of giving these people a chance to be reborn into a better life in their next incarnation, but does that then mean that wealthy people don’t need to give any offering to gather merit for their next birth? Even if they are wealthy now, if they don’t make an offering to society in this life then won’t they be reborn into a poor home in their next life? Isn’t this a kind of prejudice? Do not only offer this chance to poor people, but also do <span class="indexTerm">takuhatsu</span> at the home of wealthy people. It shouldn’t be decided on whether or not people have money now or don’t have money. You must leave behind all prejudice and do this in a way which is free from dualism and comparison. Takuhatsu must be something that comes forth from your deep Mind naturally, don’t you agree? </p><p class="P2">In the sutra that the Buddha left for us called the <span class="indexTerm">Dhammapada</span>, in the forty ninth stanza there are these beautiful words; </p><p class="P5">Just as the <span class="indexTerm">bee</span> takes the nectar of a <span class="indexTerm">flower</span> and flies away</p><p class="P5">Harming neither beauty or perfume,</p><p class="P5">So does the sage travel through town. </p><p class="P2">The Buddha teaches with this example of the bee, who moves its wings, flies around and gathers the honey. It flies and jumps around—when we see this we can see that it is not judging the flowers that it sucks nectar from, but when we hear that buzz, we can hear it as gratitude from the bee for the sweet nectar. The bee doesn’t suck all of the nectar from each flower, but going from one flower to the next he takes only a little and moves on. The flowers don’t wilt or fade because of the bee taking the nectar, he doesn’t harm the petals and the flower’s color doesn’t change, nor does it change its fragrance. The bee’s body enters the flower’s center, gathers the pollen and carries it to other flowers, pollinating them. The bee is an important pollinator, helping to bring forth more flowers by connecting the flowers with its own body. </p><p class="P2">The bee doesn’t just partake greedily and selfishly of the flower’s essence. He has a very important function, and the Vimalakirti teaches that this is how takuhatsu should be done. Those who are being given to are helped by what they are given, and those who are giving are helped by giving. According to this offering the monk’s life of that day is supported. Both the one who gives and the one who receives are mutually benefitted and given joy and development. The state of mind of takuhatsu must be that of the person of training who has let go of all attachments. This is how interactions should be done in society. </p><p class="P4">“‘Kāśyapa, while abiding in the Dharma of universal sameness, you should proceed in sequence in your begging.</p><p class="P4">“‘It is because of not eating that you should practice begging.</p><p class="P4">“‘It is because of the destruction of one’s physical integrity that you should take that lump of food. It is because of not receiving that you should receive that food.</p><p class="P4">“‘You should enter a village with the idea that it is an empty aggregation.</p><p class="P2">We mustn’t be greedy. If we get thirsty, we need some water to drink. If we get hungry we need some food to eat. If we get sleepy we need to rest. It isn’t that there are no desires or needs in our mind. To stay alive there have to be some needs fulfilled, but when they become controlling desires, then they become uncontrollable greed. If these needs are only those most basic to sustaining today’s life and they are carefully filled, this is how we can live peacefully and without grief or fear. </p><p class="P2">But when they become huge desires, then they become greed. We can stay quiet and calm, receiving exactly and only what we need.  We understand what is sufficient and are satisfied and fulfilled. Living under a tree or a roof, when we are seen by others we may look like a homeless person and bring forth pity, but in fact this is a comfortable state of mind with great joy. For those who don’t know how much is sufficient, no matter what wonderful and abundant things they are blessed with, living in a fine house with many possessions—maybe looking very fortunate to others—they will be always insecure and dissatisfied. They may appear abundant, but their Minds are impoverished. </p><p class="P2">The Southern Buddhist School is especially severe on the matter of killing life-the monks are forbidden to do labor because of this precept, that they might injure an animal or insect. If we work, we pull weeds and gather vegetables and hoe the garden, and that makes it inevitable that we will kill some living thing. With the hoe’s blade we unknowingly cut a worm, with our feet we might step on an insect. In various ways we kill life. </p><p class="P2">In society one does work and that is fine, but to kill life is forbidden for a monk so they were against doing work. This was common in the south but as it came to the North—especially in China where there were few resources available and each person had to provide for themselves—the same system became very difficult to maintain.</p><p class="P2"> For this reason, Northern Buddhism changed. In China, people who practiced Buddhism placed great importance on samu, even if it did involve killing some living things. That was seen as inevitable. Labor held a value that was not just the form of not killing living things; it was seen as a way of offering your whole self and life to society, and taking responsibility for your own livelihood was seen as a way of developing your practice. This was the way of Northern Buddhism and a central point of difference. </p><p class="P2">In Northern Buddhism a story given great importance—especially in Zen teaching—is the story of <span class="indexTerm">Hyakujo Zenji</span>. His state of Mind was the source from which came the way of organizing a Zen monastery and its specific rules. Hyakujo Zenji was always saying that someone like himself with no virtue shouldn’t be putting others to trouble and using their lives. He said that if he didn’t work for one day he wouldn’t eat for that day. </p><p class="P2">The story goes that in his late 80s he was still going out for samu; a young monk told him to please not do such a hard job, that a younger monk would do it in his place. But he wouldn’t stop. The young monks hid Hyakujo’s tools thinking that then he would stop working. But from that time onward he didn’t come to meals; for two or three days this continued. Finally someone went to ask him if there was something wrong with him, to which he answered, “No, there is nothing wrong with me.”</p><p class="P2">“Then why don’t you come for meals?”</p><p class="P2">At that time he spoke his famous words, “No work, no food!”</p><p class="P2">He left behind him the system for training that we still use today, teaching us how to live in society by these rules as well and how to practice. This Hyakujo Zenji really had a very humble Mind with respect to practice and to society. </p><p class="P2">Within Northern Buddhism the color of the flower—that way of the bee which takes the nectar but never disturbs the flower—is this state of mind as it is. This state of humility and clarity of mind has to be the way of living and receiving the grace and offerings from society. We live our own life of today and at the same time receive the grace of all people who support us in that daily life. That grace cannot just be received. We must teach and share that mind of training as well. This is the way of seeing it from the humble teachings of the Northern School.</p><p class="P4">12. “‘The forms you see are equivalent to [what] the blind [see]; the sounds you hear are equivalent to echoes; the fragrances you smell are equivalent to the wind; the flavors you eat should not be discriminated; your tactile sensations are like the realizations of wisdom; and you should understand that the dharmas are like phantasms. That which is without self-nature and without other-nature originally was not burning and will not become extinguished now.</p><p class="P4">13. “‘Kāśyapa, if you are able to enter the eight emancipations without renouncing the eight perversions, using the characteristic of perversion to enter into the correct Dharma, and using a single meal to give to all, making offerings to the buddhas and the assembly of worthies and sages—only then should you eat.</p><p class="P2">The practice of takuhatsu and the state of Mind in which takuhatsu is done—these are both coming from necessity in the daily life of the people of practice. In the dojo, before we eat we chant sutras, which mean we receive this food from people in society in order to realize our training in its deepest way. We cannot be greedy—this is the teaching of our practice, and as our practice continues we have to continually make creative and inventive efforts to live according to our path—not living according to our desires but to offer everything that we are and that we have to this path. Even if at some times we are without the things that we would prefer to eat, we will not go hungry. With various kinds of wisdom and with peoples’ kindness and offerings we will be taken care of and receive blessings. If we are practicing our Path correctly, the necessary support will always come to us without fail.</p><p class="P4">“‘To eat in this fashion is neither to have the afflictions nor to transcend the afflictions, it is neither to enter into concentration nor to arise from concentration, it is neither to abide in the world nor to abide in nirvana.</p><p class="P4">“‘Where there is charity, there are neither great nor small blessings, neither benefit nor harm. This is the correct entry into the path of buddhahood, without relying on the śrāvaka [vehicle].</p><p class="P4">“‘Kāśyapa, if you can eat according to this [understanding] then you will not render void the charity of those who feed you.’</p><p class="P2">At the dojo when we eat our meals we always take a saba offering. We do this remembering those who have no food for their starving bodies that day, and also for those beings of no form, but who are hungry in Mind and for food—for these spirits as well we give an offering—and then we eat ourselves. This is how we eat our meals in the dojo. Of course, we eat because we are hungry, but it is not because we will lose all desires that way, but that we shouldn’t be greedy in satisfying those desires. It is not about making our lives purposely difficult and then calling that practice. Rather, to eat humbly. </p><p class="P2">Entering samadhi and forgetting society is not the point, nor is it to enter society and forget our quiet within. The point is not to be drowned in society’s conditions, nor to drown in quietude and forget society’s needs. It is not the same as living in the midst of society, nor of having thrown away society. Every day we live in this way. This is the way of the Mahayana, the Path of the Mahayana, and this is the path to realize our true and original Mind. When we awaken to this we will naturally live in this way. </p><p class="P2">Yet, while we receive these offerings, we still mustn’t leave behind any remnants of thoughts of having received them, and living in this way everyday is true Buddhism. </p><p class="P2">Kasho Sonja truly had a deep mind, but if there is any dualism left it won’t be the real thing. If there’s even a little self-conscious intention to liberate people, it won’t be the clear mind. To not be attached to form and awaken to that true source and original Mind! And then to discover that with all of the different individuals, whether rich or poor, liberated or deluded, we accept them completely. To be without dualism and differentiation between poor and wealthy or any others. In this way, Vimalakirti taught Makakasyapa, and as Makakasyapa heard the words of Vimalakīrti he thought how, although he was a layperson, he had deep and profound wisdom and awakening, and he respected him greatly. For this very reason he asked the Buddha to allow him to not go to visit Vimalakīrti. </p><p class="P4">14. “At the time, World-honored One, the explanation I heard was unprecedented to me, and I immediately generated a profound sense of reverence for all bodhisattvas. I also thought, ‘This householder’s eloquence and wisdom being as they are, how could anyone who hears him not generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi? From now on I will never exhort anyone to undertake the practices of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha.’ Therefore I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">Subhūti</p><p class="P4">15. The Buddha told Subhūti, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P4">Subhūti addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past, I entered into his home to beg. At the time Vimalakīrti filled my bowl full of food and said to me,</p><p class="P4">16. “‘O Subhūti, if you are able to be universally same about eating, then the dharmas are also universally same; if the dharmas are universally same, you should also be universally same about eating. If you can practice begging like this, you may accept the food.</p><p class="P4">“‘If, Subhūti, you refrain from eradicating licentiousness, anger, and stupidity, yet are not equipped with them; if you do not destroy the body, yet accord with the single characteristic; if you do not extinguish stupidity and affection, yet generate wisdom and emancipation; if you use the characteristics of the five transgressions to attain emancipation, without either emancipation or bondage; if you do not perceive the four noble truths, yet do not fail to perceive the truths; neither attaining the results [of becoming a stream-enterer (srotāpanna), and so on,] nor not attaining the results; neither being an ordinary [unenlightened] person nor transcending the state (lit., “dharma”) of ordinary person; neither being a sage nor not being a sage; accomplishing all the dharmas yet transcending the characteristics of the dharmas — then you can accept this food.</p><p class="P4">17. “‘Subhūti, you should only accept this food if you can neither see the Buddha nor hear the Dharma, nor the six teachers of heterodox paths— Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Maskarin Gośālīputra, Saṃjayin Vairaṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, Kakuda Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, who were your<span> teachers, following whom you left home, [so that] at the defeat of those teachers you were also defeated—then you can accept this food.</span></p><p class="P4">18. “‘If, Subhūti, you can enter into the heterodox views and not reach the other shore; abide in the eight difficulties and not attain the absence of difficulty; identify with the afflictions and transcend the pure dharmas; attain the samādhi of noncontention; if all sentient beings generate this concentration; if the donors do not name you their field of blessings; if those making offerings to you fall into the three evil destinations; if you join hands with the host of Māras and make them your co-workers; if you do not differentiate yourself from the host of Māras and the sensory troubles; if you bear resentment toward all sentient beings; if you revile the Buddha, denigrate the Dharma, and do not enter the Sangha; and if you never attain extinction—if you are like this then you can accept the food.’</p><p class="P4">19. “When I heard these words, World-honored One, I was bewildered and did not understand what he had said. I did not know how to answer, so I put down the bowl and tried to leave his house. Vimalakīrti then said,</p><p class="P4">“‘O Subhūti, do not be afraid to take your bowl. What is the meaning of this? If a [phantasmagorical] person whom the Tathāgata has created through the transformation [of conjury] is criticized for this, should he be afraid?’ I said, ‘No.’ Vimalakīrti said, ‘All the dharmas have the characteristic of being like phantasmagorical transformations. You should not have any fear now. Why? All verbal explanations do not transcend this characteristic. The wise are not attached to letters, and therefore they have no fear. Why? The nature of letters transcends [their characteristics]; there are no letters. This is emancipation, and the characteristic of emancipation is the dharmas.’</p><p class="P4">20. “When Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, two hundred gods attained purification of their Dharma eyes. Therefore I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra</p><p class="P4">21. The Buddha told Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P4">Pūrṇa addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past, when I was beneath a tree in the forest explaining the Dharma to novice bhikṣus. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P2">Purna is one of the Buddha’s top disciples and was the top disciple at giving teachings. There were two of the same name, but this was the one strongest at teaching and explaining. He was truly mysteriously gifted at words. Purna Sonja was asked to go visit Vimalakirti, and he answered that he would do anything else he was asked—but that only this—he would have to refuse to do. This is how he responded. At this point he gives his reason for answering in this way. It was about something that happened a long time ago—but he remembers it, a time when he was teaching some young people who had just shaved their heads for ordination and they were all under the shade of a great tree. They were all brand new disciples of the Buddha and he was giving them a teaching. At this time Vimalakirti speaks to him,</p><p class="P4">22. “‘O Pūrṇa, you should only explain the Dharma after first entering into concentration and contemplating the minds of these people—do not put defiled food in a jewelled vessel. You should understand what these bhikṣus are thinking—do not put lapis lazuli together with crystal.</p><p class="P2">As he was teaching, Vimalakirti appeared. He told him that when you teach you should always first quiet your own mind. Right now—in what state of mind are those young people to whom you are teaching? What are they confused by at this time? What kind of suffering are they going through these days? What kind of experience have they had up until now? You have to very clearly see the state of mind of the people to whom you are speaking. Then you should begin teaching.</p><p class="P2">This is what Vimalakirti said. When you read the sutras it is often said that when the Buddha would teach he would always precede his speaking by a period of deep samadhi. He would first enter samadhi and feel deeply the state of mind of the people he was about to teach. Then he would know what way was best to reach the person; clearly aware of that, he would then begin speaking. </p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti spoke to Purna Sonja, who was known to be the top disciple at teaching the Dharma, and he said to him, “You have to see the essence of the other person’s mind clearly and according to that you have to teach them. You can’t say from your own narrow opinion and point of view that Buddha is this and the Dharma is like that. You can’t just push off what you want to say onto another who is listening—you have to really see well the condition and situation of the other person, and from that the Dharma will come forth.</p><p class="P2">This is what Vimalakirti said to Purna Sonja. Because you think of them as beginners you think you have to tell them this and tell them that—saying that this is the way that training has to be done, that is what you have to do first—but you mustn’t think that this is the right way to go about it.</p><p class="P2">To put it in a different way: that mind which wants to become ordained and follow the path, that is a very pure and clear mind. A simple mind. It is like taking a gold or silver plate and putting leftover rice gruel in it. You can’t do that. You mustn’t put scratches into that truly pure and clear mind. That mind has to be first seen clearly—that mind which is seeking the truth with a burning passion. The pure and clear mind is within, and to put an old antique on top of that won’t do. “Do not confuse priceless sapphires with glass beads.”</p><p class="P2"> Sapphires and corals and agate: coral is white, sapphires are blue, and agate is red brown. They are all jewels. A sapphire is a blue and clear jewel. Its color is beautiful and wonderful. You can’t treat a sapphire the same way you would treat a glass crystal that can be found anywhere. While the one has an excellent and superior character, one mustn’t lay on top of it a low-quality teaching. </p><p class="P2">“Without examining the spiritual faculties of living beings, do not assume the one-sidedness of their faculties.” This clear mind which is seeking to realize the truth is that very true source of the mind of all people in society. People in society are usually thinking of profit and gain and loss and are receiving influences from various things in the world. While being moved and affected by all of these various influences, they can’t manifest that clear nature, but now it has come forth. </p><p class="P2">These young students are manifesting and expressing that most pure and clear mind. Therefore don’t push onto them your own explanation and stale understanding, that pure and clear mind’s source has to be known—if you don’t know that—then you shouldn’t try to push off on them what you do know. First concentrate yourself and know your own true source. Do you know what that true source of the Mind actually is?</p><p class="P2">You don’t know that. What is important here is that true origin of the Mind. And what is this true source of mind?</p><p class="P2">Today constitutional law respects the dignity of the individual. The law respects human rights, and we respect the human rights of each other as well. To respect the individual rights of another is the moral way of living in society. Education should also respect the character and individuality of each and every person. This is how we are taught. Those characteristic qualities which we each have and that ego which we each hold are things which are individual to each person, and there can be no comparisons. </p><p class="P2">It is a matter of course that these are things that have their own value and cannot be compared. Humans, each and every one, are dignified and worthy of respect. There is no question about the dignity of each and every individual; each individual’s value has to be realized and experienced by each and every person for themselves. The problem is that ego. That ego has to recognized. </p><p class="P2">But is it the ego which is complete and dignified? It is in fact truly incomplete, and each person knows that for themselves. In each person’s mind we know well how incomplete and imperfect our ego is, and it is in the knowing of this that we wish to design that perfect and complete ideal. Because we are aware of our cluttered and distracted interior we want to become purer and clearer and make our vow to become that. While being aware of our own limited life span we pray for that life energy which is eternal.</p><p class="P2">To put it another way, the ego is incomplete. But what does it mean to recognize that incompleteness of the ego? Of course, the individual characteristics of each person are very important. Yet, while we are each a different and individual person—and this difference is also true as it is—if we held these differences as the whole truth and the absolute, then it would be impossible to live harmoniously in this world. If we each push for those differences and cling to them, it will bring about great problems. The individual differences of each of us is not the Truth.</p><p class="P2">Here we ask, what then is the true source root of all sentient beings? If we consider what is it that is prior to that ego, ask what is that root, we must look at that which unites all beings and on which all things stand. We have to know this truth which comes before the ego, the truth which comes before all of those individual differences. We have to know this directly and clearly, or else our understanding will have no meaning and we will be all the more confused. Behind the ego and behind our individual differences there is an unchanging human truth that is valid for all people without exception. We have to awaken to this truth, to know that which is the most important and dignified quality of all humans. To realize this is most important.</p><p class="P2"><span class="indexTerm">Shinran Shonin</span>, when he was still with his teacher Honen Shonin at Kurodani, made a very controversial statement one day while speaking with many other students. Shinran Shonin, speaking from his own experience, said, “My faith and that of my teacher Honen Shonin are the same.” The other disciples then said he shouldn’t talk like that. That was shameful. “If yours and the teacher’s are the same, how could you speak about it like that! How rude!” “No, that’s not what I mean, not that I act like him all day—saying that would be disrespectful—or that my wisdom and studying and knowledge are the same. To say that would be rude. But our true faith has to be the same—it must be that way.”</p><p class="P2">Neither side would retreat. Then they decided that those that think it is the same or different should sit on opposite sides and each sat on the side they believed in. Those who said it was the same were only Shinran Shonin and the monk from Renshobo in Kumagaya. They were the only two sitting on that side. Everyone else sat on the other side. To make this matter clear they saw that they would have to ask their teacher or it couldn’t be settled, so they asked Honen Shonin to come and settle the disagreement. Which is correct, they asked him. He answered without hesitation.</p><p class="P2">Honen Shonin said that he had received his faith from Nyorai Buddha and Shinran Shonin’s faith was also received from Nyorai Buddha so it must be the same—if it wasn’t the same they couldn’t go to the same eastern paradise—this was his decisive statement.</p><p class="P2">In the <span class="indexTerm">Mumonkan</span> it says, “To see with the same eyes as the Patriarchs and to hear with the same ears as the Patriarchs.” It says the same thing very clearly. The faith of Shinran Shonin, the faith of Honen Shonin, the faith of the Buddha, and the faith of each and every one of us is one and the same.</p><p class="P2">It is a question of whether or not you know this same unchanging quality that the Patriarchs and the Buddha share. This is what truly liberates and what brings true peace. Each person has his or her own individual qualities, their own specialties. We each have an ego that will decay and fade away, so that could not be our eternal life. There is only one true faith—that which is eternal as the Buddha Nature, unchanging and never-ending. To understand this is very important. </p><p class="P2">The true root of all sentient beings is here, not in the gathered knowledge and opinions of the ego. That which is the same and unites all beings, not in knowledge and ego, but in that unchanging wisdom and life, is the mind prior to experience. That mind which is even prior to the baby’s marking with heredity before its birth. That true and clear mind free from any clutter or stain, transparent and clear, is what Vimalakirti was referring to as the pure mind of these young bhiksus.</p><p class="P2">In Buddhism this is often referred to as the great round mirror like wisdom. The human mind is like a mirror, huge and open and pure. Without bounds, huge is this all-embracing wisdom of the human mind. Human’s mind at birth is this same all-embracing wisdom. Whatever comes in front of a mirror is reflected exactly as it is. The mountains are reflected and the ocean is also reflected, the sun, the moon, and tens of thousands of stars are all reflected in the mirror—the whole universe can be reflected there. </p><p class="P2">Everywhere the mirror is turned, everything it faces is included in it. This huge space which can be taken in and reflected by the mirror is what is likened to our mind. To realize this is to awaken to the wisdom of the Buddha. The awakening to the true source of all sentient beings is just this. </p><p class="P2">Our egoistic awareness has been added on after we are born; originally it didn’t exist. We were originally truly like that mirror, untainted and wide open and huge, vast and expansive. This was our mind from birth. This huge spacious mind could embrace the mountains and the ocean and the sun and all the tens of thousands of stars—all of this could be embraced therein. This mind which can embrace all things is, just as it is, all things and all worlds. It is the whole universe—just as it is, this is the Mind.</p><p class="P2">In Buddhism it is expressed in “One is, as it is, the All; the All is, as it is, the One.” In this way we explain it with words—the world is me and I am the world. If we know the true source of all beings, we will of course know this and that this huge spaciousness is our true Mind and the root source of all beings. This is in all humans, and to awaken to this is our highest awakening. </p><p class="P2">Another way of putting it is like that <span class="indexTerm">mirror</span> which reflects whatever comes in front of it: if it is a man, the man is reflected; if it is a woman, the woman is reflected. If an elderly person comes in front of it, an elderly person is reflected; if a child comes in front of it, a child is reflected. This means that if a sick person comes, we then become one with that sick person—or if a child comes we become one with that child. If a poor person comes we become poor, and if a hungry person comes we also become the state of mind of that hungry person. </p><p class="P2">In the mirror the exact same thing is reflected as what comes in front of it—this is because our state of mind and the person who is in front of us become matched perfectly in oneness. There is no place for a small-self to be inserted. Nor is there any place for a view of a self and other to be inserted. This huge expansive state embraces the other within it, allows another to be comfortably within it. </p><p class="P2">You become the other in this huge spaciousness, and this is the state of mind with which humans are endowed from the origin. Here there are no such small groupings as clans or races or countries. This is the place where that warm love beyond dualism is found springing forth spontaneously. This huge and wide expansiveness, this warm mind, is humans’ true and original nature—and to become aware of this is to awaken to true love. To awaken to that true source root of all sentient beings is to awaken that true love for all beings. This is not a love born from dualistic perception or knowledge or intellectualization. Our wisdom opens and that true great love is born naturally.</p><p class="P2">In the words of Zen, there is the expression that if we have one thousand bodies of water we will also have one thousand moons. If we have no clouds for ten thousand miles we will have ten thousand miles of high sky. If there are one thousand rivers, in each of the thousand rivers the moon will be reflected. If there is not a single tatter of a cloud, if the sky is wide open endlessly, this is like our state of mind from the origin. If one thousand people’s minds become clear like this wide open sky, there are one thousand Buddha-like and God-like minds born. </p><p class="P2">In the same way that the one thousand moons reflected in the one thousand rivers are all the same moon, the transparent mind free of any such thing as an ego or personal characteristic—or any stain of that sort, without any need for that—this is the Buddha Nature. This mind is the same in each person and this is what <span class="indexTerm">Honen Shonin</span> meant with the words he spoke when he said that his faith and that of Shinran Shonin were the same. This is how it is written in the Tannisho. </p><p class="P2">The ego will decay, but the Mind which is awakened to the truth will never decay or fade away. For one who has awakened to that truth, even if their physical body dies, this awakened mind will not decay. This truth without death, the awakening to this eternal mind, this is the satori of the true root source of all beings. This is the awakening to the source of humans’ most dignified quality. This is the true peace of mind, the true faith.</p><p class="P2">Not holding onto an idea of your own position or standing, the true deep wisdom can be born naturally. To put it a different way, if we don’t hold on to any idea of an “I,” then that world which comes into our eyes, that world which echoes in our ears, all of these are my world, my life. So if we don’t carry around any small-self, forgetting ourselves completely, we can make others joyful and that is what makes us joyful. Always thinking about what will make others happy and what will make others secure, this is the state of mind which will come to be understood naturally. </p><p class="P2">If we don’t hold onto a small-self then everything we encounter is our selves, there is no sense of separation between self and others, then just as it is the life energy will surge forth. The world of direct perception will be born; this is the world of the wisdom of the Buddha. When we experience this we can know that the world is our true self and that all of humankind is, as it is, our true self. Without any barriers between self and others, without any sense of self and other, in this way, the working of the deep mind comes forth naturally, and that deep love comes forth of its own, spontaneously. Not a love forced by someone else, but that which comes out naturally and of its own. This is not just for some special person but for all people equally, the compassion of the Buddha. This kind of wisdom and compassion comes forth spontaneously and we know it as coming from our True mind. It manifests from our True mind which is the true source of all sentient beings. As human beings, that source root is the source also of a great true love for all beings. To forget yourself and love others, this is the actual realization of the doing of that. All beings born are vessels for this great love and compassion and we must all know that.</p><p class="P4">“‘You are unable to understand the fundamental sources of sentient beings—do not inspire them with the Hinayana Dharma. Other and self are without flaw, so do not harm them.”</p><p class="P2">These new students, these monks who are about to enter the path, are without any scratches, only wanting to clarify the truth in one straight line. They are of a clear mind like a beautiful jewel. The Mind of the Buddha and the Mind of God—while they are in that state of Mind, why do you try to wound their purity with some low-level teaching? Teaching them that they have to do it like this or they’d better do it like that, to push it on them in such a way is not the way to do it. Vimalakirti says to Purna Sonja that you are telling them how they should become enlightened themselves, telling them to just work on their own enlightenment; this is a small and narrow-minded teaching, and you must not teach in that way.</p><p class="P4">“If someone wants to travel the great path (i.e., practice the Mahayana), do not show them a small pathway. The ocean cannot be contained within the hoofprint of an ox; the radiance of the sun cannot be equaled by that of a firefly.” </p><p class="P2">That great path, the path which embraces all things—to walk on it firmly and with confidence— that is the path of the Bodhisattva. To give one’s life and body for all beings and to make a determined commitment to clarify the truth is the way of this path. This vow is that firm and sturdy middle way for all beings. In this, there can be no small-minded wishes for your own personal good fortune or wishes for your own personal peace, it is not such a narrow path. You mustn’t teach a small narrow path like that. Like the huge Pacific Ocean, it is expansive and great, not like some narrow ox hoof path, pushing someone into a tiny hole. Like the great sun, which illuminates the whole universe, it is that kind of light. It can’t be treated like the light of a lightning bug.</p><p class="P4">“‘Pūrṇa, these bhikṣus have long since generated the aspiration for the Mahayana but in the midst [of many rebirths] they have forgotten this intention.</p><p class="P4">“‘Why would you teach them with the Hinayana Dharma? When I consider the Hinayana, its wisdom is as minute as a blind man’s, [and with it you are] unable to discriminate the sharp and dull faculties of all sentient beings.’</p><p class="P2">In fact, these monks in the very old days were those who had awakened their Bodhisattva vow and then forgot that vow and became attached again to the things of society, forgetting their vow completely. They forgot, but their true nature was still seeking the Path of the Mahayana way. Why would you teach them some narrow and rigid way? What would be the point of that? From the way I see it, any small, narrow, and superficial way of teaching them is like making them blind. While living in a huge expansive world, they won’t be able to see anything. Unable to see another’s light or another’s character, the other’s efforts will be invisible to them as well.</p><p class="P4">23. “Then Vimalakīrti entered into samādhi and made the bhikṣus aware of their previous lives. They had planted virtuous roots under five hundred buddhas and had rededicated them to their [eventual achievement of] anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. </p><p class="P2">In this way, Vimalakirti entered samadhi silently, and all of them saw their past forms as enlightened beings serving the Buddhas to awaken all beings, offering themselves for the merit of all beings. </p><p class="P2">“I understand.” Shinran Shonin, left behind these famous words, “If we investigate the desires and delusions of those all around Amida we see that this deep vow is to save this one person.” These words were spoken by him. <span class="indexTerm">Amida Nyorai</span> for a very long time let him play around, and then at age forty-eight he decided to liberate all beings. When he looked carefully he saw that it was to save himself as well, that this is how Amida had done it. This is what these words are about. But still, there couldn’t be anything this impractical. </p><p class="P2">The Buddha was saving all beings, leaving out not even one—if anyone is left at all he wouldn’t become a Buddha, and Shinran Shonin was representing himself as that one yet unliberated person. This is what we hear at a superficial listening. It sounds like words which are belittling self for the salvation of all beings. It seems as if he is saying that for someone as bad and evil as he is, it must have been a vow of that nature. </p><p class="P2">Amida Nyorai’s great vow, which he made at age forty-eight, was the vow to liberate all beings with no exceptions whatsoever. This was all done to liberate this deeply sinful Shinran Shonin. Very, very humbly spoken words, but from experience, if we look more deeply we see that these are in fact words of great confidence. Shinran—that one person—is one of no family and no parents, and no other connections to other beings either. </p><p class="P2">In all of the mountains and rivers, in all of that great boundless space, having let go of all of the mountains and rivers and gone beyond all of them, in all of the heavens and earth only this one—this Shinran. </p><p class="P2">Christ was on the cross for me, this One, if not for me there would have been no Christ on the cross. God and Buddha are both here to make efforts for my salvation, for this very One, the worth of this One. Nyorai and self—complete in Oneness. Knowing the meaning and experience of this One, this is the great depth of Shinran’s faith.</p><p class="P2">Here, for the first time, that most dignified, unchanging, true self has been realized. In this realization the true source of all beings has been clarified. That self that no one else can do anything about. That self that no one can give any help for. That absolute self is what is awakened to. </p><p class="P2">Someone once wrote about this and I read this story about an excellent and very intimate <span class="indexTerm">elderly couple</span> who, when growing old together, had such deep faith in each other and always supported and helped each other’s good health; in this way they lived together. They always talked about what they would do if one of them got sick—and that the healthy one would take care of the other as much as they possibly could to the very end. </p><p class="P2">The husband told his wife that he would throw away everything in order to take care of her, and she said that she would throw away everything to take care of him. The husband became sick with cancer, and the woman without any hesitation left behind all her work and affiliations and took care of him wholeheartedly and tirelessly. </p><p class="P2">From morning to night she stayed by him and took care of him, rubbing his back and feeding him herself at mealtimes; at night she would stay up all night next to him when he couldn’t sleep. In this way she put everything into his caregiving. Doing this, his wife realized that in the doing of all of this there was no meaning whatsoever. Her husband’s pain and loneliness and suffering—she could cover for those things, the doctor was also there, and the medicine and the treatment—but no matter how hard she worked she knew it was all superficial and that concerning her husband’s state of mind there wasn’t anything she could do—she could not touch that at all. </p><p class="P2">She realized this and became melancholy knowing that she was just roaming around the outside of his mind and not able to pierce to its depths at all. To have done that much and put that much effort into it and to have it only come to this, she couldn’t jump into his truly suffering mind at all. She realized this directly. </p><p class="P2">His wife said, “No matter how wholeheartedly I make efforts and throw myself into it, it is all a superficial solution only. Now I have realized the problems and depths of the human mind’s profound corners for the first time. Humans want to give someone this or that, and that can be done to a certain degree, but it is all superficial and that True mind cannot be touched in its deepest reaches. At that time, I realized that all that I could possibly do is to pray. Of course, I do everything I can to take care of him, but to continue to pray in one straight line is the only thing that I can do to connect to his deepest mind. For the first time I have realized this.”</p><p class="P2">We think we would like to be helped by others, but there are things that we can only do for ourselves. These are the matters of the deepest corners of our own mind. As Shinran Shonin said, it was all for this One. This One person—that which no one can do anything for or about— to realize that is where there is enlightenment. </p><p class="P2">That awakening to that One being. This is the truth of the Buddha and the Patriarchs, that dignified and unchanging One. This is what we are allowed to realize. This One is that which has the supreme enlightenment. This One is the one that gives the sun its radiance and energy and gives the moon its illumination. It brings the hundreds of flowers into bloom and the farmers’ efforts into brilliant fulfillment. For those who make clothes, it makes their labor shine, the trolley and bus and car, they all shine when this One rides in them. For this One all humankind makes efforts. If we understand the value of that One we know why the Buddha said that there is only One in these heavens and earth. Those words of the Buddha were said for all beings, for each and every one who is the most important in all of the heavens and earth. From his own experience this was coming forth, this knowing that each and every human is splendid and becomes a Buddha and is of a value that is not the slightest bit different from the Buddha. This is what Buddhism is teaching us.</p><p class="P4">[Learning this], they immediately experienced a suddenly expansive reacquisition of that original inspiration. At this the bhikṣus bowed their heads in reverence to Vimalakīrti’s feet. Then Vimalakīrti explained the Dharma for them, and they never again retrogressed from [their progress to] anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P4">24. “I thought, ‘ Śrāvakas do not consider the faculties of people and therefore should not explain the Dharma.’</p><p class="P2"> “Then Vimalakirti said to the young Bhiksus in a Dharma teaching that they should strengthen their deep vow, and he congratulated them. This was the occasion that makes me want to not go and visit him.” This was Purna Sonja speaking, the disciple who was above and beyond everyone at the teaching and speaking of the Dharma. Purna Sonja also refused to go.</p><p class="P4">“Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1">Poem Opening Teisho<br/>Feburary 2009</p><p class="P5">The winter woods, peaceful and still, pure and fresh. </p><p class="P5">A person of clear wisdom sees the emptiness of all things. </p><p class="P5">Infinite, deluded attachments –<br/> Break through them! </p><p class="P5">Clarify your self-nature! <br/>Realize the primal truth!</p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P3">Mahākātyāyana</p><p class="P2">Today it is Makakasennen, number six of the Buddha’s main disciples. This one is known for his great debating excellence. He was brilliant and would always win a debate, while also teaching the truth to the person with whom he was debating. The Buddha asked him to go to visit the ailing Vimalakirti, but just as the others had, Makakasennen also refused.</p><p class="P4">25. The Buddha told Mahākātyāyana, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P4">Kātyāyana addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past, when the Buddha briefly explained the essentials of the Dharma to some bhikṣus, and immediately afterward I expanded upon your meaning, discussing the meanings of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and extinction. </p><p class="P2">He then told the Buddha why: It was because he was afraid to go and say the careless wrong thing when he went to see the Licchavi Vimalakirti. He gave his past experience, and in that, the truth is being taught: That these main disciples of the Buddha are those who entered the Path from hearing the teachings, yet this does not make them Mahayana practitioners. There are people who continue and follow the Bodhisattva Path as well; they did not sit down on just hearing the teaching. The Licchavi Vimalakirti here is speaking to that very tendency—to be satisfied and get stagnant and stop one’s practice. But it was this which was the reason: Because Vimalakirti had cautioned Makakasennen to not be so narrow in his point of view when he was teaching.</p><p class="P4">At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P4">26. “‘O Kātyāyana, do not explain the Dharma of the true characteristic using the mental processes of generation and extinction (i.e., samsara).</p><p class="P2">Here he tells the Buddha about his past experience with Vimalakirti: how one day he was telling some people some things the Buddha had taught about impermanence and suffering, about how there is no such thing as a fixed form called an ego, and how our eternal Mind is peaceful and serene. These are the basic truths of early Buddhism: that everything is always changing and in flux; that there is nothing that is exempt from this; and that since everything is always changing, our fixed preconceived notions have no meaning. If we see clearly that all forms have no permanent actuality, we will know serene Mind. These three are the ridge-poles, the three main truths of early Buddhism. When the Mahayana was born, it rolled them all into one, all three of them—teaching about that deeply seeing eye which sees everything as truly empty.</p><p class="P4"> “‘Kātyāyana, the dharmas are ultimately neither generated nor extinguished: this is the meaning of impermanence. ii) “‘The five skandhas are empty throughout, with no arising: this is the meaning of suffering. iii) “‘The dharmas ultimately do not exist: this is the meaning of emptiness. iv) “‘There is no self in the self, yet no duality: this is the meaning of no-self.</p><p class="P2">The Buddha always taught this very teaching of impermanence, and although we all know about this matter of impermanence we treat it rather vaguely, while for our each and every breath we need to be clear and sharp. If not, we get superficial and we get very shallow in how we regard things. Our karmic connection with this life will end at some point. And if we are always sharp on this point that it is going to end, we will not be deluded and we will not be vague. We want to learn our true base, to see it, and to live from it. We have to know this larger picture. </p><p class="P2">This is why the Buddha always said: Everything is impermanent. Everyone’s life is changing, going through flux all the time, and it is also decreasing. There is no one alive who is getting more life to them as the days go by. Life is always flowing away. This is how the Buddha taught. No one wants to think about that. It is a melancholy way of looking at things, how it is decreasing and going to be gone. And while we are here now, healthy, together, how many others are also in the world who are sick at this very moment, who are handicapped, who are being operated on in the operating room without knowing how it’s going to come out? People are lonely and feeling isolated in nursing home beds everywhere.</p><p class="P2">It is by experiencing these things that we don’t get superficial, nor do we get shallow. We see that everyone’s suffering is my very own suffering. And also we have to see clearly how everything is always changing, and how to keep each other out of this melancholy point of view.</p><p class="P2"> The river which flows ceaselessly—there is no place in that river’s flow that can be pointed to and said, “This is the river.” The flowers blooming last week have now fallen. We look there where the flowers were and we see that already there are green buds of leaves peaking through. There is a continuation, and there is always change. Emptiness does not mean that there is nothing there at all, but that it is always changing. This is emptiness. As we come to see this change we have to keep in mind the larger picture which includes it.</p><p class="P2">It is a basic teaching of the Buddha that all things are affected by change and that there is nothing with a fixed form. So then what should we believe in if we see things steadily changing—directly, closely, without taking our eyes off it? We have to see and then ask, “So where are we born from?” If we look deeply we see that our Mind’s source is zero, or to put it another way, it is like a huge great mirror. The Mind’s source cannot be described and it cannot be limited by saying it is something which is born and can die. But we have to once experience this source, that inexplicable source prior to things being in flux, prior to things being impermanent, where we are not attached to that impermanence! The Buddha taught this always and said what we should become is that true source of the birth of all things. This was the Buddha’s way of teaching, of guiding the process of that. To see things prior to their division into impermanence or into flux! These heavens and earth are always transforming and bursting through any limits, piercing through all of it! The earth trembles, the heavens are shaking! We then realize this truth and what is prior to all of that and from there we walk freely in the crossroads downtown, living in ongoing samadhi.</p><p class="P2">The Records of Master Rinzai gives us a description of how humans are: How on a Spring day there is a newly born baby. This newly born baby has a wrinkled face; it has the potential for a white beard three meters long like some kind of monster. Rinzai also says the words, “In this five foot lump of red flesh, there is a true person of no rank which is always coming in and going out.” </p><p class="P2">This actual thing, why does it appear in this monster-like form? Because it is in our preconceived notion of humans, about how life proceeds, how it is seen through our reading of books, by our gathering of ideas about how things will be, deceiving ourselves. We rather, of course, believe that we will last forever, and we laugh at others who are narrow in their beliefs. In this way we appear like monsters. If we live in that true clear mind with which we are born, however—that originally completely clear state of mind—we will not get stuck on such a view or go against the teaching of Master <span class="indexTerm">Dogen</span> who said it so clearly when he said how it is in its natural way: In the morning the rooster crows; The sunrises in the East, and the moon goes down in the West; After every three years there comes a leap year; And below our horizontal eyes there is a vertical nose. This is the way of the Buddha. To see all things from this true way of seeing— as a baby sees—or how can we say that we are actually seeing? Knowing this and acting from it is the only way that we can possibly revitalize people and the world. And if we can’t see this way, that can’t be done.</p><p class="P2">In this ōsesshin, to let go of all of our endless thinking about things in the world, society, our past experiences, and become simply that life energy, which is looking at the floor smack in front of us. These eyes see not only for ourselves, but for all people. And then we see how all people are our friends and our family, sharing what we lack, helping those who fall to stand again. Not to kick the people who have fallen along the way, but to support each other. That simple, clear, natural way of being human will bring us to that true place, to that true way of what the Buddha is teaching. And right there we can once again see and find that which we have so deeply forgotten. That is our greatest responsibility!</p><p class="P2">Again, we have the disciple Makakasennen who had been trying to explain the Buddha’s basic teachings when Vimalakirti had come in and said, “How could he be teaching like this? This world is always transforming, it’s always in flux, and all of the situations in the world are always in dynamic flux.” We cannot be caught and tossed around by how these changes are always happening. People in society under great pressure, such as those who are sick, immigrants, older people—we want to do something to help them. This is our natural inclination, our common state of mind.</p><p class="P4">“‘Kātyāyana, the dharmas are ultimately neither generated nor extinguished: this is the meaning of impermanence. ii) “‘The five skandhas are empty throughout, with no arising: this is the meaning of suffering.</p><p class="P2">Then Vimalakirti cautions him: “You say everything is in flux, but what is it that is in flux? How do you know it is in flux?” The spring flowers fall. After they fall, the green leaves on the branches make a cool shade in the hot summer sun. The seasons turn in order, they appear to change. This is transforming, like the billions of cells in our body that are always changing. We ourselves, as young children, and later when we are a little bit older and functioning,— we perceive that we are in flux. But a flux of what? There is only this one moment. “In all the boundless realms of space and in the distance between self and other, not even a single hair can be inserted! From the boundless past to the limitless future, we have never been separated from this very moment.” </p><p class="P2">We look at old <span class="indexTerm">photographs</span> and we can see it more clearly. In those old photographs we see what was present in that very brief moment of being. It is not even a second, it is one twenty-fourth of a second. There are the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, winter, but this is all in our memory. We bring this to what we are seeing. It is a story. What we are actually seeing is a one-second moment only. Actually, it’s very brief. That one moment is not something which can be created, nor is it something which can be destroyed. In our brain cells we hold on to an image and we bring this history to it because we have a thing called memory. This true moment: we’ve received it, but it can’t stand still as it is. Only this one moment is true awareness.</p><p class="P2">That true mind-moment and each moment’s new awareness is what is real. This is what we do zazen for: to be able to cut sharply and see clearly and directly. We have to return to our purest perception. During the first days of sesshin the reason everybody is sleepy and vague and foggy is because we are still moved around by lingering ideas and memories of the world that we are coming from. If we are clear about this and understand it, we can just see it as that. We also have to see that those autumn leaves, they are only autumn leaves and nothing but that—nothing added on, no memory! The spring flowers are only spring flowers and nothing added on, no memory! If we don’t see this clearly, then we are always mistakenly seeing, pulling other things into what we perceive, seeing the passing flow as something real and permanent. There is only one, brief second! We have to see that each brief second is what there is, and for this we have to be able to cut with a sharp, knife-like awareness and be able to see that truth in each and every encounter. Only is that one moment a clear truth!</p><p class="P2">Master Daijo was asked by a monk, “What is the eternal and indestructible truth?” To this monk, Master Daijo said a poem: </p><p class="P5">The mountains’ flowers bloom all at once. </p><p class="P5">The wind blows, and they all fall at once. </p><p class="P5">When a strong wind comes by,<br/>the coloured leaves of Autumn</p><p class="P5">Suddenly dance into the sky<br/>and fall to the ground. </p><p class="P2">It is the actuality of this one instant which is the only eternal life. It is not about some idea or image about something that is eternal. And this one eternal moment is not born and does not die. That river’s water which flows without ever ceasing, this is the actuality of the eternal truth.</p><p class="P4">iii) “‘The dharmas ultimately do not exist: this is the meaning of emptiness.</p><p class="P2">We cannot misunderstand what the Buddha said about this voidness of the five aggregates, the five aggregates as written about in the Heart Sutra. Because we have a form we have a perception.</p><p class="P2">With this perception comes an image from which action comes forth, and from that action comes a memory of the action and the form. These are the five aggregates. Because we have eyes and they perceive, we think we know there is a flower there. And seeing that flower, which is a form, we think we would like to perhaps pick that flower and put it in a vase to gather it and have it. </p><p class="P2">These ways of operating are so automatic that we don’t even notice how our ongoing perception is working through that operation. We don’t really look into how this is working. In fact, if we look at this flower, it may appear to be outside of us, but what is actually occurring is the functioning of the five aggregates within our mind. The flower has just appeared in our mind; we are reflecting it. So in fact, it is actually empty from the beginning; it has no actual substance. It is empty from the origin. And if we know this and how it is true about all things—that everything is empty from the origin, that there is nothing terrible that can happen that makes us feel scared or unhappy— then, likewise, there is nothing wonderful that can happen that is real that makes us happy, because we become aware that all of it is passing phenomena. In this way, Vimalakirti tells Makakasennen not to confuse people by talking about things that are not real and external as if they are.</p><p class="P2">Though everything in the world appears to exist, it is all in fact only phenomena. It is in fact nowhere.  This is not meant in a nihilistic way, but in the way of ongoing change.  Since it is always changing, it can’t be said to be.  ‘That which is form is emptiness.  That which is emptiness is form.’ Because it has no fixed reality, it is always changing, and so it can’t be said to have a decided, substantial form.</p><p class="P4">iv) “‘There is no self in the self, yet no duality: this is the meaning of no-self.</p><p class="P4"> v) “‘The dharmas were originally not burning and will not become extinguished now: this is the meaning of extinction.’ </p><p class="P2">Each and every one of us has an apparent self that appears to laugh and to cry and to speak. But this is in fact as Master <span class="indexTerm">Rinzai</span> has put it: “In this five foot lump of red flesh, there is a true person of no rank always coming in and going out of the orifices. If we haven’t seen it yet, see it now!” In our eyes, it becomes seeing. In our ears it becomes hearing, in our nose it becomes smelling, in our mouth it becomes tasting, in our body it becomes feeling. As our hands, it carries things. As our feet, it walks us. We are all endowed with this true person of no rank and these five senses inside of which we seem to perceive. But in fact we are more than that. We are actually much more huge than that. We are not caught or stuck in a small, limited, physical body. As our eyes, this true person of no rank becomes the seeing of all things. As our ears, it becomes hearing of every single sound in existence. We are not yet fully developed, so we cannot hear ten people’s stories which are all being simultaneously told to us and then make a clear decision on which one is telling the truth.</p><p class="P2">In fact, there was a great man in ancient Japan named Shotoko Daishi who was known to be able to hear ten different citizens telling their side of a story, and on hearing them all at the same time, he could decide which one was truthful and how to resolve their dispute. This is how huge our potential is. As <span class="indexTerm">Eisai Zenji</span> has written, “Oh great, all-embracing mind, it is impossible to measure the height of the heavens. Yet the mind is above the heavens. It is impossible to measure the thickness of the earth. Yet the mind is below the earth. The sun and the moon, they shine with a great radiance, yet the Mind is the source of that radiance. Within the Mind, the four seasons open in their sequence. Within the Mind, the sun and the moon move.” Oh great, all-embracing mind, we are this small person, but we also go beyond that. We are not closed down and trapped in some small idea of a “me.” That is why we are not only a small-self; we are selfless as well. </p><p class="P4">27. “When [Vimalakīrti] explained this Dharma, the bhikṣus’ minds attained emancipation. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P2">We humans get so confused when our personal opinions are not listened to and not liked. But we get so happy when somebody likes what we say and praises us. We have this <span class="indexTerm">koan</span> of <span class="indexTerm">Goso Hoen Zenji</span> telling of a woman in China named <span class="indexTerm">Seijo</span> who left home, married, had a child, and lived in the world. [<span class="indexTerm">Mumonkan</span>, <span class="indexTerm">Seijo and her Soul are Seperated</span>, (35)] And for those same five years there was also a Seijo who lived drowsily in the back room of her father’s house. When these two Seijos finally came together and met, they embraced and became one true Seijo. So which do you think of those is the real you? This is what is being asked here. When they become one and the same, they become vigorous. There is no one who has ever lost their Buddha-nature. But if we stay in that same view that we are a small, limited self, then our Buddha-nature stays asleep. We have to see that huger version of who we are; that is our true self. The small-self does not not exist. But we have to see that this is not all we are. We live in society. But that is not all we are. Our true self, our true nature, has to be realized. That version which is sleeping in the back room, that Buddha-nature —that which is without any ego—we have to know it directly. And these are not two separate ones. From the origin, we are empty of any ego to be caught on. And this is the way the Licchavi Vimalakirti cautioned him in his teaching.</p><p class="P2">‘That which has no intrinsic substance and no other sort of substance does not burn. And what does not burn is not extinguished. Such lack of extinction is the meaning of peace.’</p><p class="P2">We have to extinguish those flames of greed, extinguish those flames of anger, extinguish those flames of ignorance. We have to realize the Mind where all of these have been extinguished. This is what Rinzai is saying when he talks about the true Dharma having no form and yet it is extending in all the ten directions. In <span class="Title_20_in_20_Text">On Believing in Mind</span> it says, “The True Mind in which there is nothing missing and nothing extra.” Everything in this universe that is happening is an activity of our awareness. If we get caught on our being a physical body, then there is birth and death. But even if we think that is all we are, we are still that eternal Mind that is eternal truth and peace. We have to realize that, and we have to be able to teach that and speak in that way as well, or we will always be misperceiving the true nature in other people. We have to realize these three truths, not just hear them and think about them, or they will become mental poisons that are limiting. In this way, Vimalakirti cautioned Makakasennen. And in this way by being cautioned, we have all learned about this too. It is in this way that we have to see and learn to be, and this is why Makakasenen did not want to go see the Licchavi Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P3">Aniruddha</p><p class="P2">From today we have the section about Aniruddha Sonja. The Buddha asked him to go to see the Licchavi Vimalakirti—Aniruddha Sonja being one of the top disciples, the one who was known to have the divine eye. The Buddha asked him to go in place of the Buddha, but Aniruddha explained, as had the others, why he could not go. </p><p class="P4">28. The Buddha told Aniruddha, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P2">Aniruddha Sonja was known for having the divine eye. As it is says in the Yuikyo Sutra, the Buddha on the brink of dying said to his disciples gathered near that he would be leaving now. No one could answer, so he continued by saying that if there was anything left they wanted to ask, this was their last chance. Still no response. “Do you all understand the Four Noble Truths?” And at that time it was Aniruddha Sonja who answered saying that even if the sun were to go cold, all of them without exception would continue to live in accordance with the teaching of the Four Noble Truths, which the Buddha had given them.</p><p class="P2">After he had awakened, when the Buddha was still young, he returned for the first time to his home country. His father, the king, told him he should stop wandering all over and come to his home country and teach the young people there, the many people who needed his deep teaching. During his visit to his home country he did not stay in the castle. He stayed in the forest nearby, and many, many young people gathered and joined him there as disciples, including his own cousin, Ananda. Among them was Aniruddha. To Aniruddha, the Buddha had to speak clearly and sharply, because Aniruddha would sleep all the time. And Buddha said to him, ‘There is nothing wrong with sleeping, but to do the sleeping after awakening.’ Until then he had to work with all of his resources on his deep awakening. He took these words to heart. He intensely felt the pain of the Buddha having to speak to him in this way, and he worked so hard on breaking through that he became blind from being so intensely unwilling to fall asleep anymore. However, at the same time that he became physically blind, his divine eye opened. And so he became known as the disciple who had opened his divine eye.</p><p class="P2">When we practice for a long time we become able to make use of what is called the <span class="indexTerm">Five Powers</span>. These five powers are to see what others cannot see, to hear what others cannot hear, to fly in the sky, to walk on the water, to know what others are thinking, and we can know well in what way we have lived in past lives. These are called the Five Powers, and Aniruddha Sonja could see what and where no one else could see. Aniruddha had crushed his physical eyes, opening his divine eye, while we who have physical eyesight often cannot see the deepest essence.</p><p class="P2">From Okayama Prefecture there came a great swordsman, <span class="indexTerm">Miyamoto Musashi</span>. He was famous also for his Zen painting, one line of which was like the line drawn by the sharpest sword. He would say that the physically seeing eye was very shallow, it could only see superficially. But the eye of Avalokiteshvara—Kannon bodhisattva—is said to be able to see sounds. For this, we have to forget our physical eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body, feelings and various thoughts, and only then can we perceive this all-embracing sound of the profoundest prajna wisdom. This is the eye of all-embracing wisdom. When we see something, we have to see its truest essence deeply—to see it not only with our physically body, but to hear it with the whole universe. We have the words of Hakuin when he says to hear the sound of the single hand. When two hands come together and make a clapping sound, we know what that sounds like, but how can a sound be made with a single hand? This means to hear the sound of the whole universe with the ear which is the whole universe. The divine eye spoken of here is that prajna eye, the eye of deepest wisdom. Since it is the eye of the whole universe, it doesn’t miss a thing. As Miyamoto Musashi said, our physical eye sees only superficially, but this deeply seeing-eye sees in the deepest possible way. And therefore his opponent could never defeat him.</p><p class="P4">Aniruddha addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why?</p><p class="P4">29. “I remember once in the past I was walking quietly in a certain location. At the time a Brahmā king named Adorned Purity, in the company of ten thousand Brahmās generating pure radiance, proceeded to where I was. He bowed to my feet in reverence and asked me, ‘How much, Aniruddha, can you see with your divine eye?’</p><p class="P4">“I answered, ‘Sir, I see the trimegachiliocosm of Śākyamuni’s buddha land as if I were looking at a mango in the palm of my hand.’</p><p class="P2">Aniruddha says to the Buddha that, when he was doing walking zazen the Brahma Subhavyuha asked him how far he could see with his divine eye. While we think of <span class="indexTerm">kinhin</span> as something we do for our hurting legs, in fact it is a practice that has been done since the time of the Buddha to keep our zazen alive, in motion. When the scenery around us is changing, to keep our zazen going no matter what—this is kinhin. Even Shuri Handoku, who was famous for having such a hard time learning anything, was taught just one of these phrases that is used in the practice of walking zazen. The one phrase that he was taught to always focus on and never forget was to wipe away the dirt, wipe away the soil. With just those words, he focused and broke through. Later, they often practiced the repetition of the Buddha’s name or famous four-line verses, many of which were in the Diamond Sutra, such as: “Abiding nowhere, awakened mind arises”, or “Thus shall you think of all this fleeting world: A star at dawn, a bubble in the stream, a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp, a phantom and a dream.”</p><p class="P2">Aniruddha had been walking when the great Brahma and ten thousand Brahmas came to his feet and asked him, “What can you see with that Divine eye?”</p><p class="P4">30. “Then Vimalakīrti came and said to me, ‘O Aniruddha, is the seeing of the divine eye a constructed characteristic, or is it an unconstructed characteristic? If it is a constructed characteristic, then it is equivalent to the five supernormal powers of the heterodox paths. If it is an unconstructed characteristic then it is unconditioned and should be without seeing (i.e., “views”).’ World-honored One, at the time I remained silent.</p><p class="P2">Then, having said that, Vimalakirti appeared and said, “Aniruddha, the divine eye, is it an eye which is seeing what is, for example, going on in Europe, or going on in Asia, things of form, things of shape? And, if it is a divine eye which only sees forms, then it is only something of the external paths of the five supernatural powers mentioned earlier. These are simply miracles. That is not the Buddha-dharma. On the other hand, if what you are seeing with the Divine eye is seeing the world of nothing at all, then there is nothing to see.” In this way, Vimalakirti cautioned Aniruddha. And upon hearing that, all Aniruddha could do to respond was to stand there, speechless.</p><p class="P2">In the Diamond Sutra, it teaches how there are five eyes; the physical eyes, the wisdom eye, the dharma eye, the heavenly eye, and the Buddha eye. What most of us have are the physical eye, the eye that sees things, sees colors. It can see people, animals, the scenery, see all the ten thousand things. These are the usual eyes. </p><p class="P2">The one that is able to see above that is the heavenly eye. It sees beyond shape and form. It sees the essence, like the parent who looks at a school child coming home from school that day and knows, just by looking at the child, what kind of a day that child had at school. After that, we have the eye of wisdom. It can see the coming of spring, the flowers that are about to bloom. While at the same time that it can see the scenery, it can also see how things are always changing, like the billions of cells always dying and being born again in our bodies. But not only that—the phenomena—but also the voidness within it. </p><p class="P2">The next is the Dharma eye, that which sees as the Buddha saw, that a flower is red and that the leaves are green. This universe’s whole history can be seen in one instant, in one slice of all time. Then we have the Buddha eye. “In all the three realms, every single being is my child. In all the three realms, every single place is my home.” In this way, the Buddha taught. And in this way the Buddha eye sees how all things are exactly like our children, they are our children. And that suffering which they endure cannot be left as it is. And so from this compassion one acts, having seen from the Buddha’s eye. But even with these capabilities, we cannot hesitate, start and stop. We have to use every function continually.</p><p class="P4">‘If it is a constructed characteristic, then it is equivalent to the five supernormal powers of the heterodox paths. If it is an unconstructed characteristic then it is unconditioned and should be without seeing (i.e., “views”).’</p><p class="P4">31. “Hearing his words, the Brahmās attained something unprecedented, immediately reverenced [Vimalakīrti], and asked him, ‘Who in this world has the true divine eye?’</p><p class="P2">The heavenly God <span class="indexTerm">Banton</span> O <span class="indexTerm">Brahma</span> heard Vimalakirti’s words and was deeply impressed, and when I did not say anything, he faced again toward Vimalakirti. Having bowed to him, he said, “Who then in the world possesses the divine eye?” The only one who truly sees is the Buddha. Whether sad things, happy things, good things, or bad things happen, whether being born or dying. By having a form we also are affected in a dualistic way. This is how the world is generally perceived. But in the Buddha’s eye, life and death appear but they do not appear as two, nor do good and bad appear as two, because he is seeing from this view of the not-two. And this is the way the Buddha always taught.</p><p class="P2">Vimalakirti answered that in the world it is the Buddhas who have the divine eye. They see all the Buddha fields without even leaving their state of concentration and without being affected by duality. </p><p class="P2">Always forgetting the small-self, the dualistic world of self and others! If we stay moved around by any idea of a self relative to a world, we’re always stuck in dualism. Instead, to do zazen from morning until night, night until morning, that mu continuing, our eyes, our ears, all of our perceptions gathered into oneness! That which is seeing becomes that which is seen. That which is hearing becomes that which is heard. All of it as one. Our eyes see, our ears hear. All of the abilities are used, but from morning ‘til night, night until morning, we don’t divide our awareness. It stays unified. It’s not about closing our eyes so that we can only see one thing, but doubt being without any small-self’s reflection on what we have been doing and on what we see. This is samadhi.</p><p class="P2">This is not an intoxication of whatever we are seeing we get caught on what we are seeing, and when we are hearing we get caught on that which we hear. We have to purify the activity of our awareness. And then we can become just like a mirror where we see and that which we see is reflected perfectly and reflected with no other traces. This is the same with the ears, and because the clappers and the keisaku and the bell get so interruptive, we go out at yaza, sitting with nothing to obstruct us. This is the deep subtlety of zazen. We have to be able to function this way as well. To receive our eyes and everything that comes through them truthfully. This is true receiving of only what is actually there and nothing else. Usually we hold on to what we see and hear and don’t want to let go of it. We let it bully us, and that tires out our awareness and our perception.</p><p class="P2">We go beyond our dualistic limits within our ears: it is as if we can hear the whole future at once. In one single flower, though, we can also see that flower’s whole future and history. Because we once let go of each thing, the new thing can be seen, simply—perceived precisely and directly. Again, zazen is not intoxication. This is why people are deeply amazed. Or else while living in the world, we lose our being in wonder.</p><p class="P4"> Vimalakīrti said, ‘There is the Buddha, the World honored One, who has attained the true divine eye. Always in samādhi, he sees all the buddha lands without any characteristic of duality.’</p><p class="P2">But this is not only about the Buddhas. We, too, can see most directly and most truly. Never mind seeing into someone else’s mind, or supernatural powers such as that. What do we need more than seeing what is right in front of us? If you want to see how the future will be, look at the past. And if we aren’t seeing this, it is because we are distracted and not seeing the true origin. This is what Vimalakirti is teaching us here.</p><p class="P2">From the time when the Buddha taught his friends at the Deer Park through the time when he died on the banks near Kushinagara, he continually taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Suffering and self-view, grasping is suffering, the truth of impermanence; the path to liberation is right understanding in this Eightfold Path of the right view, the right intention, the right speech, the right action, the right livelihood, the right effort, the right mindfulness and the right concentration. What state of mind will we be in to truly realize that state of mind of nirvana and that Mind to liberate all beings? All of this is written in the Eightfold Path. All eight are important, yet they are all rolled into one in right mindfulness. As the Sixth Patriarch has also said, when it all comes down to it, we have three things: That mind where there are no caught mind-moments, no polluted mind-moments; that mind where there is no form of a self-centering “I”; and that mind where there is no abiding in a stagnant way. We are always flowing, never staying in one place. This is the way the Buddha taught us to be in clear mind-moments–clarity in each moment, leaving nothing remaining. This is the way of the true mind-moment. And then we are the mind of not-two, naturally.</p><p class="P4">32. “At this Adorned Purity Brahmā King and his attending five hundred Brahmā kings all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. They bowed to Vimalakīrti’s feet, then instantly disappeared. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">Upāli</p><p class="P4">33. The Buddha told Upāli, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P2">Today we read about Upali Sonja. Upali was from the <span class="indexTerm">Dalit</span> class in India. As you read about before, when the Buddha had returned to his home country after many years, he was welcomed and acclaimed, and many young people became his disciples. They had their beautiful long, black hair shaved off at the barber, at which the barber was very astonished. “Why were they doing that?” he asked them, and they said, “Do you not know?” And one young man said to him, “You don’t know. The prince of this country was awakened deeply and is now teaching and taking disciples. This long hair has meaning if you are in society. But in order to cut attachment to desires and ego, we become disciples, we cut our hair.” This was Ananda who was telling the barber, Upali. This Dalit barber asked him, “Could even someone like me, a Dalit, also be a disciple?” To this Ananda said, “Of course! There are no such castes in the Buddha’s teaching, where everything is realized as clearly being equal.” Hearing this, Upali cut his own hair, and he swiftly went to the Buddha’s place. Ananda, having family and wealth, took more time to say goodbye to everyone and get things together, and he came to the place of the Buddha awhile after Upali had arrived there. It was the custom, the requirement, to “receive the feet”—to prostrate to your senior and to the Buddha. Ananda arrived, prostrated to the Buddha, went to prostrate to the next senior monk, but who else did he come upon but the feet of the Dalit, Upali. Being a person of much higher class, he could not bear to prostrate at the feet of a Dalit—Upali the barber. The Buddha saw this and said, “Ananda, bow to Upali’s feet,” but Ananda could not bring himself to do it. “Ananda, bow to Upali’s feet.” Three times the Buddha told him, and three times Ananda could not bring himself to do it. </p><p class="P2">At that time, the Buddha gave the great teaching about the rivers of India. In India there are five great rivers. There is the Indus River, the Ganges River, and three other rivers. As the Buddha said, they are all separate when they are as rivers in India. But as they leave, they all flow, each of them, into the same sea. When they gather and become the same ocean, these five rivers are one and the same ocean. The five castes in India are all the same when they become his disciples. People may be different when they are in the caste system, but as the Buddha’s disciple, they become one and the same human being. And if we do not see this, we cannot possibly awaken to our True mind. Finally, Ananda could prostrate to Upali’s feet. Upali was probably the most deeply amazed at this whole thing. He had always been treated as a slave, a lowly person, and here he was now being prostrated to by Ananda. To this true teaching, he repented all of his own past, mistaken behavior. He took the Precepts. </p><p class="P2">We know about how there are five hundred precepts for bhikkhus and seven hundred and fifty for bhikkhunis. But these are the precepts that are based on the five basic precepts of how one should not kill and should not steal, should not lie, should not be unclear in relationships between men and women, and should not become intoxicated. These were the base of the hundreds of precepts later decided upon. The Mahayana, always using as its base Buddha-nature, maintains the five basic precepts, which are based on Buddha-nature, and did not detail so many individual rules.</p><p class="P4">Upāli addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why?</p><p class="P4">“I remember once in the past, there were two bhikṣus who had violated the practice of the Vinaya but from their shame did not dare ask you about it. They came to ask me: ‘O Upāli, we have violated the Vinaya and are sincerely ashamed, not daring to ask the Buddha about it. We want you to explain our doubts and the [need for] repentance, so that we may be relieved of the transgressions.’ </p><p class="P2">The Buddha told Upali to go to see Vimalakirti, but Upali said he could not possibly do that, and he explained why. It was because two people who had broken Precepts did not want to go to the Buddha and tell him because they were too embarrassed and ashamed, so they asked Upali to please help them. “I told them I would help them purify their mistaken behavior.” And most important in our religions is indeed this examining of and reviewing our past behavior. We are all constantly making mistakes—the mistaken three behaviors of body, the mistaken four behaviors of mouth, and the mistaken three behaviors of mind. And in these ways we are always behaving unskillfully. So we declare our commitment to change our behavior in front of the Buddha. There is a particular repentance verse chanted for this, and there is a way of chanting the name of all of the three thousand Buddhas, prostrating at the chanting of the name of each one, a total of three thousand prostrations. It takes about one week to do this ceremony. </p><p class="P2">We chant the Buddha’s name while we put our forehead to the floor, bend our back, and actualize that repentance. In doing this, for the first time we then declare and own our mistakes. This is what is called the repentance of form. But even though we actively repent with the body, the mind is the source of our mistaken behavior, and so we have to also repent our mind’s way of having expressed itself. </p><p class="P2">The best way of doing this is zazen. If you want to truly review and change your behavior, then sit with a straight back, and sit free of any bit of obstruction in your clear mind. You then will realize how all mistaken behavior comes from our murky, occluded state of mind. This is like the clouds in the dark, dark sky. When the morning sun shines through those clouds, everything becomes illuminated, radiant, and all the darkness is dispelled. </p><p class="P2">It is the same in our mind. When the true light of clarity comes, all the clouds and murkiness are dispelled. Zazen is not just about doing koans or sitting, but about clarifying our truest state of mind, and this is not just about sitting only in a zendo. This is about sitting, being in that clarified state of mind, from morning until night and night until morning in all the positions of sitting, standing, lying down, getting up, walking—all day long, we continue.</p><p class="P2"> This is what it is to live. This is zazen. If we don’t clarify and purify our mind, that is not zazen. Nor can we leave our cushion and just forget about that zazen. This is the zazen of true clarification. And without that, it is not true zazen.</p><p class="P4">I immediately explained [the matter] to them according to the Dharma.</p><p class="P4">34. “At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P4">“‘O Upāli, do not increase these two bhikṣus’ transgressions. You should just remove [the transgressions] and not disturb their minds. Why?</p><p class="P4">“‘The nature of those transgressions does not reside within, it does not reside without, and it does not reside in the middle.</p><p class="P2">Here Upali was teaching them the way of repenting, when, along comes Vimalakirti, saying that what Upali was teaching them was going to make things even worse and that they were going to instead make more mistakes. Rather, they had to see the true source of this mistaken behavior, or it was all useless. And then Vimalakirti taught Upali of the true repentance.</p><p class="P2">On top of having made a mistake, to bring forth the idea that there is an “I” who makes a mistake is adding on yet another mistake. You have to teach people the source of what they have done in a mistaken way, or they will make an even bigger mistake; they will mistakenly apprehend their mind’s true base. In today’s world, there may be some things that are said here which are very hard to grasp. We generally punish mistakes today. Vimalakirti is saying that what we need to do is not punish but educate, and this is what needs to happen more in today’s world. In the olden days, we had the great man of wisdom Honin Shonin, who taught that we have to especially liberate the person who behaves in the worst possible way. People who bring forth that kind of phenomena really have to learn that their behavior is phenomena that they have created themselves. Then doesn’t this mean that they are being excused and allowed to do, encouraged to do, whatever they want to? To this Honin Shonin answered, “Could you kill a thousand people? That is not so easy to do in reality. And if there is no thought to kill someone, or someone there to kill, it isn’t easy to kill even one single person, let alone a thousand people.” These are the words of Honin Shonin. Here we have the true source of how we can either increase misbehavior or correct it. </p><p class="P2">The great Kansho <span class="indexTerm">Gitano Genpo</span> went to a prison where there were many people incarcerated. He went up on a high platform, addressing all of them. He bowed to all of them, and he said, “You all have the same exact clear mind as that of the Buddha. But because of bad karmic connections and situations, you have to be here, living in this way. Thank you for all of your great efforts.” There was not a dry eye in the audience. Everyone’s head was bent over, and everyone was in tears. </p><p class="P2">In today’s world, criminals are treated in such a way that they only produce more criminals. We have to see through this in a clear way, in the way that Vimalakirti is teaching. Using the path of the Buddha, it can be realigned, and that forgotten state of mind can be reinstated. To do zazen that is not dark and grumbly, but to clarify and purify in each and every breath, each and every moment! To become like today’s sky, bright, big and blue without a speck of cloud anywhere! To believe in this state of mind, and from there to do zazen in each breath; to clarify in each and every breath, and to continue doing this is what is most important.</p><p class="P6">“‘As the Buddha has explained, when their minds are defiled, sentient beings are defiled. When their minds are purified, sentient beings are purified. </p><p class="P2">The Licchavi Vimalakirti then says why this is so. For example, if we should make the mistake of stealing, we take something we desire which is there, and it is because that thing was there that the desire arose. If nothing was there, even if we had the desire we would not have made that mistake. And, likewise, if the thing was there, but there was no desire, we would not have made that mistake. So this is not something which is inside, it is not something which is outside, it is not in the thing, and it is not in the mind-moment arising. The mistake is a temporary phenomenon only. It has no actual substance. We have to see this clearly and understand well how it happens, how one mind-moment comes to pass. And if we are not attached to this mind-moment and are not attached to that thing, this is true repentance. If we see this world through desire, the whole world becomes what we desire. If we are pure in mind, everything we see is pure, so the desiring mind is what has to be aligned. If the mind is clear, everything we see and hear is clear, just as the Buddha has taught. In this way, the Vimalakirti cautioned Upali.</p><p class="P2">The mind likewise does not reside within, does not reside without, and does not reside in the middle. Just so is the mind, and just so are transgression and defilement. The dharmas are also likewise, in not transcending suchness.</p><p class="P2">Our mind that is mistakenly desiring was not there from the origin. In one fleeting moment, that desire arises. It was not always there. Our mind is originally pure. It is not about something that happens inside nor outside nor in between. The desirous mind fleetingly arises. In that brief transient moment, it appears. Someone with a habit of stealing might steal something, but that is not something that was there in their mind from the origin. There is no such thing as a pre-determined thief. There might be a company’s president who would embezzle money from a bank because he cannot pay his employees as much as he would like to; he may even embezzle money many times because he knows his employees don’t have enough money from their salaries to afford to send their children to college and pay their tuition. He’s very sorry he doesn’t have enough money to give them and he thinks, “If there was just some more money, it would really help. Where can I get just a little more money for those employees? I need to help them some more, I need to help them some more.” And it suddenly occurs to him that he could think up a good embezzlement scheme. And so it gets started. He is usually a good earnest customer at this bank. And it then turns into this relationship, not because he wants to steal, but just because of how things have gone.</p><p class="P4">“‘Just so, Upāli, when one attains emancipation using the characteristics of the mind, is it (i.e., the mind) defiled or not?’ I said, ‘It is not.’ Vimalakīrti said, ‘The characteristics of the minds of all sentient beings are likewise, in being without defilement. </p><p class="P2">Next, Vimalakirti says this to them. Even if we make a mistake, our true nature is not touched, nor is it stained. </p><p class="P2">Today we have so many crimes that it just becomes a matter of course. People don’t even consider these crimes as mistakes or something unusual. In Okayama Prefecture in Japan, there was a Daimyo named the <span class="indexTerm">Matsudaido Daimyo</span>. In this era a young man killed his parents and was caught. This young man said to the Daimyo and his agency who caught him, “Where is my mistake? What is wrong with killing my parents?” And then the Daimyo looked within very carefully and said, “I have not reached my people and taught my people well.” And because of this, he called many teachers to teach this young man. He brought many wise teachers of different subjects, people who were specialists on Confucianism, for example. And for three years, he educated this young man, teaching him the true way of how people should be. And finally the young man cried in apology and regret, with deepest sorrow. The very parents who had given him birth into this world, he had killed. He cried in sorrow and apologized. At the beginning of all of this, this young man had thought, “Well, after all, sometimes animals kill their parents, and there’s nothing wrong with that, so why shouldn’t he?” This young man looking inside himself in a stern way, apologizing, and, admitting his mistake, this is the Buddha nature functioning. Having seen his own true self, the Daimyo saw that this big change had occurred. To be able to see one’s True mind in this way: This is satori. </p><p class="P2">It is the extraneous thoughts that are our suffering. It is our anxious concerns that are our suffering—in today’s unsettled world to be apprehensive and worrying, with a mind confused about what is important. Instead, we have to see clearly what is most important. This is the true way of being human. But today this is so far from how things are done. People have to see what it means to know a mind that is free from these mistakes, or we become more and more capable of  making these mistakes. When we see what is clear to begin with, those mistakes become harder to make. This is the teaching that we have to see very carefully.</p><p class="P4">35. “‘O Upāli, to have false concepts is defilement; to be without false concepts is purity. “‘Confusion is defilement, and the absence of confusion is purity. “‘To grasp the self is defilement, and not to grasp the self is purity.”</p><p class="P2">To have this mistaken way of looking at things is an upside-down and backwards way of seeing; to correct this upside-down-ness is to see clearly that in this world of transiency, there is nothing to be attached to. But people are always trying to hold on to their possessions, to hold on to their view of reality. While everything is always changing, we cannot let go of our deep passion for certain things. All of this is an upside-down view. Or we are always looking for something to make us happy. But there is no end to this. It never completely happens. We get one thing and then we want something else, and then we want something even bigger, and then something even better, and then something even more to make us happy. We are always pulled along by this, and that is suffering. We are always caught in the concept of suffering, the concept of enjoying, the concept of having and not losing. These are upside-down views. From the origin, we are not caught on any of these things. But we perceive that there is such a thing as a “me,” a small-self. </p><p class="P2">At birth, no such thing was there, but we see and we hear, we touch, we smell, we perceive. And then there becomes an idea of what is perceiving, seeing, hearing, and feeling; that becomes a hardened, fixed version of something that we come to consider as a “me” or a small-self, yet another upside-down view, which we hold on to in ignorance.</p><p class="P2">We hold on to our idea that this world is permanent, another upside-down view. To let go of this view and know that all things are equal and the same! We can’t try to only bring happiness and caring to certain special people; that is also an upside-down view. But rather, to give all people and all situations our deepest caring —attention and energy for liberating everyone. We cannot stop in these efforts to completely liberate our mind from these upside-down views, because each and every person must become awakened to make a world of true peace. The Mahayana teaching is to liberate these upside-down views, to free us from this small-self interpretation and preoccupation, and to reinvigorate the true view, that there is only oneness in the whole world.</p><p class="P4"> “‘Upāli, all the dharmas are generated and extinguished, without abiding. Like phantasms or lightning bolts, the dharmas do not depend on each other. They do not abide even for a single instant. The dharmas are all false views, like a dream, like a mirage, like the moon [reflected] in water, like an image in a mirror—[all] generated from false conceptualization. Those who understand this are called “upholders of the Vinaya.” Those who understand this are said to “understand well.”’</p><p class="P2">Next he says, “Upali, all existence is like flowing of the river water. It always is flowing and flowing and flowing, changing and changing and changing, not like a puddle, stopped and stagnant. This is what causes us to misunderstand the world, which actually has no fixed existence. Rather, it is like a phantom or a bubble—it fades in an instant.” But because we pile up our hardened views, we cannot move left or right. We think so much, and that is why we are unable to see clearly. We can’t get caught on and stopped by phenomena. There is nothing that doesn’t change. It is all like magical illusions, clouds and lighting. Things are evanescent. They don’t remain for even an instant. All things are like dreams, hallucinations and unreal visions, the reflection of the moon in the water, a mirror image. This is how all things are.</p><p class="P2"> We want to protect what we imagine is our own thing. Again and again and again, we reinvent these imagined ideas of what we own, and we think they are real. But things are not permanent. There is no forever to them. We have to leave them all behind when we die. If we just try to decorate our lives and to get our own self-satisfaction, it will never happen. To see this and live, and see clearly as we live, is the purpose for the Buddha’s Precepts. If we make mistakes because of a belief in some phenomenon, then we are going to incur further mistakes. If we believe in a small-self that is perpetuating those behaviors, then that is just going further into this mistaken way of seeing. In this way, Vimalakirti cautioned Upali.</p><p class="P2">What Vimalakirti is teaching Upali here is very far from what we of a relative world living in secondary perceptions are familiar with. We are so influenced by our mental ideas. </p><p class="P2">We have this teaching of Master Rinzai about the Dharma body—the clean, pure light in a moment of our Mind, the undifferentiated light in a moment of our Mind, the undiscriminated light in a moment of our Mind. This very base on which the world is set is like a mirror, that great, round, full, all-embracing mirror wisdom with which we are all endowed from the origin—our Mind’s truest source and actuality. While every day it is functioning, we are only ever seeing the shadow.</p><p class="P2">Nor is it a mind of differentiating things which is true and alive. Where does that first mind-moment come forth from? That place where there has never been a single caught mind-moment! This is what we have to directly experience. For doing this we perhaps will be doing Mu. To not see the shadow of that Mu, though, but to pull its actualization and see it from our truly seeing eye, and with that truly seeing eye, which is our whole body and being seeing, to see this! When we are living outside, where there is so much external activity and things to give our attention to, it’s a very hard thing to do because we are always getting caught on things and exhausting ourselves. We do zazen for this, to realize our truest nature, to understand that clarity of mind, to be totally present in each and every mind-moment, to see it at it’s arising with great patience, to where we melt together into oneness with it. For those who are doing sussokan, the breath practice, to enter the samadhi of sussokan to the point where we lose track of our own physical body. We couldn’t think a thought if we were told to, and we don’t even know what is around us. Finally, we even lose track of what it is to be doing it and what is doing it. The world all around us— we have to experience it just once, to its ultimate. [The roshi] thinks of us all as being like that inchworm on the freezing morning. This inchworm who stretches as far forward as it possibly can. And when it stretches as far as it possibly can stretch, then it brings its back legs up to where it stretched. We have to stretch and stretch and stretch some more, and as we stretch as much as we possibly can, the universe won’t leave us behind. Suddenly, we see clearly. It is as if we have realized this place where vertically we know all the three realms of time and horizontally we find ourselves in all the ten directions, swallowed down by the whole universe, truly an excellent expression of this experience. People have put it this way, as it is the Dharma body. And because we haven’t experienced this yet, we find our mind still confused, and it’s difficult to truly hear what it is the Vimalakirti is teaching here and actually accept it.</p><p class="P2">To actually realize this state of mind is the formless repentance. And yet that actual mistaken behavior still remains. That formless repentance has to occur, and that is the base, but there still is a need for repentance at the material level as well.</p><p class="P2"> In the old days, there was a very popular novel which was based on a true story. And this is the story, in an area of Kyushu called <span class="indexTerm">Nakatsu</span>, about a man named <span class="indexTerm">Zenkai</span>. Zenkai had murdered a guard in the prison where he was incarcerated. He killed the guard and escaped. Later, he became ordained and was called Zenkai. </p><p class="P2">After he was ordained he travelled to a shrine but the path to it was very narrow, it was a nearly impossible to cross ledge on a narrow cliff. Right below the ledge there was an ocean, and as he was crossing it he saw a mother and child fall to their death in the ocean from this narrow ledge, where hundreds had died. </p><p class="P2">He wanted so much to atone his crime of killing that he decided that he would cut a tunnel through the rock of the cliff so people would not have to travel along that ledge and keep dying there. </p><p class="P2">For over ten years he dug; not so easy through the rock for a single person. And then one day, the very son of the person he had killed came looking for his father’s murderer. As he had to pass this way, he saw the tunnel being built, and he asked to help dig that tunnel, because he felt the building of it was so important. And it was not until one day in a casual conversation they were having that he realized this Zenkai who was building the tunnel was the very criminal that he had been searching for to take revenge upon. But, because the tunnel was so important for pilgrims and travellers, he decided that he would wait, and the very day the tunnel was done, only then would he take his revenge. Zenkai started building the tunnel ten years before he came, and it was another twenty years later that the tunnel was completed. On that day they hugged in celebration, and at that very moment it was Zenkai who prostrated to the son of the man he had killed and said, “Please kill me now.” </p><p class="P2">Zenkai had known for years that this was the son and that he had come so long ago to avenge his father’s death. But the son no longer had any feeling for killing Zenkai after seeing what he had done to repent for killing his father, what Zenkai had offered to society from his own deep mind of repentance. The son told him he had no more intention of doing that, seeing how much Zenkai had offered for this deep mistake. There is no one who creates a mistake all by themselves in isolation. And it is to this that we all offer those four vows, for us all together to make this true repentance. To make it a world of pain or to make it a world of purity is the responsibility of all of us. Not to punish, but to together repent and purify.</p><p class="P4">36. “At this the two bhikṣus said, ‘Such superior wisdom! Upāli cannot<span> match this! There could be no better explanation of upholding the Vinaya!’ “I then answered, ‘Excluding the Tathāgata, there has never been a śrāvaka or bodhisattva able to command the eloquence for such a felicitous explanation—such is the brilliance of his wisdom!’ </span></p><p class="P4">37. “At the time, the doubts and [need for] repentance of the two bhikṣus were eliminated. They generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, speaking this vow: ‘Let all sentient beings attain this [level of] eloquence!’ Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P2">Hearing this, the two were absolved of all of their mistakes and prayed that all beings would realize this state of mind. Upali was like a small light coming into a dark town to let people know. Vimalakirti was the great sunshine that would bring light to all things. And then, Upali said to them, “Do not entertain the notion that he is a mere householder! With the exception of the Tathagata himself, there is no disciple or bodhisattva capable of competing with his eloquence or rivaling the brilliance of his wisdom.” This vow was then made that all in the whole world would awaken. These two were absolved from their mistakes, and they prayed for all beings to be liberated. “And this is why,” said Upali, “I can’t go to visit the Vimalakirti. He taught me how very small my wisdom is. If I go to see him, he’s going to say to me, ‘You’re the one who’s sick.’ And so I beg you to understand why I can’t go to visit him.”</p><p class="P2">In today’s world of great pain and challenge, if we only work for our own good fortune, the vow can never be realized. But, just as a lotus, the flower that blooms forth from the mud yet has no speck of mud on it, our Buddha-nature as well is like this. We are making mistakes all the time, and yet there is no stain from that on our True mind, on our original nature. To not be deceived by our extraneous thinking, but to be focused and not be distracted, and with our most sincere mind, to dig in fully. We can’t be lax in these efforts, not just sit with a head full of thoughts. If we sit with whole-hearted effort, the effort is returned to us in the same way that, when we plant a garden we put in seeds, and as we care for them well, we receive our harvest in kind. We can’t waste our precious time. We have to realize that true source. To realize and realize and realize and realize! In zazen we feel this deeply even though we don’t think about it, but we feel it deeply. But because we are pushed and pulled around by all of our thoughts, we don’t reach it. We have to be able to dig into this and see it and complete it and not waste this most precious opportunity.</p><p class="P3">Rāhula</p><p class="P2">Today we have Rahula, the one who was most excellent at the secret virtue practice, the Buddha’s own son, Rahula. In today’s Zen dojo, as one of the most important practices, people do things for others without them knowing it. Quietly cleaning the toilet, for example, when no one is looking. To see what needs to be done, has been forgotten, and do it when no one is looking: this is called “hidden virtue.” Zazen done late at night is also done in a place where it is unnoticed. Today, people are required to do yaza, but it is not to be done as a forced thing, actually. In the olden days, you would cover your face and go out secretly to be unrecognized when you went to do yaza, because zazen is not done for oneself, but to align the mind not only of oneself but of all other people as well. We have been given this chance to practice, but not everyone has that chance. As I do zazen in their place as well, that will also purify everyone’s state of mind. To do this for the illumination of all beings, is called an offering. To thank the Buddha for all people, we read a sutra, and after each sutra there is an eko, a special offering for the sutra reading. Our sitting, our cleaning, our eating is all an offering we send to others. This is tricky if we get arrogant about how much we are doing something for others, and that is why we often do it in secret. Cleaning where no one thought about doing it, when no one is looking, picking up litter wherever we might find it, to not wastefully use water and to not overeat: all of these are part of these secret virtuous practices.</p><p class="P4">38. The Buddha told Rāhula, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P4">Rāhula addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why?</p><p class="P4">“I remember once in the past, the elders’ sons of Vaiśālī came to where I was, bowed their heads to me in reverence, and asked, ‘O Rāhula, you are the son of the Buddha, who forsook the position of universal ruler (cakravartin) and left home for the path (i.e., enlightenment). What benefits are there to leaving home?’</p><p class="P2">The Buddha’s own son was Rahula. When he was young, the Buddha himself had been very philosophical, a little nervous, always reading books and investigating. Because of this tendency, which was uncomfortable for many people, he was introduced to Yasodhara, who became his wife. He was not so excited about this. He was deeply inspired to investigate why humans were the way they are, so full of desires, engaging in friction, not at peace. What would bring out their deeper, positive potential? Rahula was born from this marriage, but it was very soon after that, after his birth, that the Buddha left the palace. Rahula was raised by his mother, Princess Yasodhara.</p><p class="P2">Soon after the Buddha was awakened he went to Deer Park, and his disciples increased day by day. Many were philosophers, people of the external ways, debaters, people who had lost at debates and become disciples from there. After several years he returned to his home country with several hundreds of his disciples, and, when he returned to the castle, it was a great joy for his father, the king, his wife, Princess Yasodhara, and his son Rahula, who was then around seven or eight years old. They prepared great, abundant feasts and lodging. However, the Buddha and all of his disciples stayed in the woods at Nicorandana. They did eat at the castle. People were so deeply impressed with the Buddha that many young people wanted to also become his disciples and do training. But many of the parents were against their sons leaving to do training; they were very angry. But Rahula’s father, the Buddha, told him to come with him and live in the woods, to shave his head and join the disciples. Later, the family lineage faded away because of this. Yet, Rahula stayed with the monks. The king and his mother, Princess Yasodhara, were very sorrowful seeing Rahula taken away, and certainly resented the Buddha for doing this. Rahula, being the actual son of the Buddha, very much stood out, but he always stayed in the background. Even in the traditional scroll of the Buddha entering Parinirvana, Rahula is always pictured far away at the periphery. He would also do all kinds of things to help others, cleaning up their messes and things, so everyone else would call him the most excellent at hidden virtues. This was not something that he would call himself.</p><p class="P2">In the sutras, it teaches that the Buddha saw all people of the world as if he was looking at his own son, which would be Rahula. Of course, it was also because it was his own son, but he offered everything to everyone in the world. Rahula was doing training even harder than others, always worried that it would be bad for his father if he did not. One day, he was walking in the city of Vaisali and met up with several sons of wealthy families. They approached Rahula, and because he was ordained, prostrated to him. They were asking him why was he after all ordained when he was in the royal family to guide the country and to keep things in alignment? Wouldn’t it have been better if he took care of his lineage and stayed in that family? Isn’t it better to lead politically? Rahula, who was the son of the Buddha, replied, as the saying goes, “If we are ordained, all of our ancestors would be reborn in heaven. And that is why he had chosen this particular way of realizing his training.”</p><p class="P4">“I then explained to them, according to the Dharma, the benefits of the merits of leaving home. At that point Vimalakīrti came and said to me, </p><p class="P4">39. “‘O Rāhula, you should not explain the benefits of the merits of leaving home.”</p><p class="P2">Rahula spoke to them about the virtues of ordination, and Vimalakirti said, “Don’t talk so much about those things. If you talk about it like that, then that is not the true ordination. To talk about having done this and having done that, that is all delusive. In the world, people seek benefit. But this is not the case in the world of ordination. We have to go beyond all of that. The world of ordination, the world of renunciation, we go beyond that to a further shore, this world beyond desires, beyond any idea of benefit or profit at all.</p><p class="P2">Twenty years ago the very first group of the East-West Spiritual Exchange came to Japan. They came to the Roshi’s temple through his deep karmic connection with the Exchange and this connection is still on-going. At that time there were eighteen people from contemplative monasteries all over Europe, and they were at Sogenji for eight days. From there, they went to other zendos around Japan after having been basically oriented at Sogenji. There were among them many abbots from the various monasteries in Europe. One of them is now the current head abbot at Otillion. Another one was Abbot Tonini; he was already well aged at that time, and he was a very well developed abbot. At a symposium held during that time, the participants from Japan and from the West asked each other different questions about what was important to understand well. And people asked each other this question: People who are ordained have family and friends; why do we leave and go away from them, these friends who love you and are so concerned about you, why do you leave them? In the Christian monastic system, it is for one’s whole life. Father Tonini said, after a while, “We all have love in our lives, various kinds of love that comes to us with people with whom we have connections. But, it is not about us choosing those; it is about God having chosen us.” We have the words of Dogen Zenji, which say to forget your body, forget your thoughts, dive into the home of the Buddha without form, without force, letting go of everything. We are living, then, in a world of entrusting completely. To live in a world where there is no idea or preconceived notion about it. Yet, who gave us this direction? We have to dive into the deepest depth, or it is not true. Master Unmon has said: This whole world, it is so huge, so enormous. So why, at the sound of a bell, do we put on our robes and kesa? We have to see this clearly, or we are not going to be totally transparent in how we live.</p><p class="P4">“Why? To be without benefit and without merits—this is leaving home. One may explain that there are benefits and merits in the conditioned dharmas, but leaving home is an unconditioned dharma and there are no benefits and merits in unconditioned dharmas.”</p><p class="P2">For people of training there is no idea about being liberated or not liberated—only living in accordance with the heavens and earth. There are sixty-two various ways of thinking about this world, but none of them pertain to a person of ordination; they are not caught on conceptual thinking about it. They are not concerned with whether they are praised or whether they are insulted. They are not in their head about being ordained. There is a saying: While stomping on the head of the Venerable King or Buddha, we prostrate to the feet of a three-year-old. Always putting oneself in the lowest place, and this is why the head is shaved. In the slum or in the prison, to be at home with patch-robe clothes, blending in with everyone around.</p><p class="P4">“‘Rāhula, to leave home is to be without that and this, and without intermediate. It is to transcend the sixty-two views and be located in nirvana. “‘[Leaving home] is accepted by the wise and practiced by the sagely. It subjugates the host of Māras and [allows one to] transcend the five destinations, purify the five eyes, attain the five powers, and establish the five faculties.”</p><p class="P2">All day long, to be in deep concentration within, every footstep, every hand motion absorbed within, no space for any deluded thoughts or ideas to even enter. The five states of existence: These are the realms of hell, hungry ghosts, brutes, humans, and demons, with the realm of heavenly beings being the sixth one. Here in the sutra, it is the five states without the heavenly beings, because these five states are all the world of painful delusion. Purifying that with these five eyes: there is the physical eye with which we see the material world; the heavenly eye that sees into the vast realms of space; the wisdom eye that sees all things clearly and sharply, and sees the emptiness of <span class="indexTerm">Mu</span> ; the compassionate eye that sees all beings and what they need most to be liberated; and the Buddha eye which is only One, and all inclusive. To deeply believe and to make strong efforts. To see things clearly and simply and exactly as they are right now.</p><p class="P2">We have the hardest time knowing how to let go within human relationships, and we cannot disconnect so far that we do it in a harmful way. Some people disconnect too far and start creating things that are toxic for others. We have to separate from all, but in a way that is not harmful to anyone.</p><p class="P4">“It is to be without vexation over “that,” to transcend the host of heterogeneous evils, and to demolish the heterodox paths. It is to transcend provisional names and emerge from the muck [of samsara]. It is to be without attachments, without any sense of personal possession. It is to be without experience, without turmoil. It is to harbor joy within and defend the intentions of others. It is to accord with meditation and transcend the host of transgressions. If one can be like this, then this is true leaving home.’ </p><p class="P2">There are many ways of looking at things in the world today, at all times, and that is fine. But if it is just about words that are skillful and manipulative and there is no essence or content, we have to see clearly what is being said and where what we are saying is coming from. To really chew it well, and see how true it really is. To not be obstructed by pretty words and shallow ideas, such as quick-term self-improvement and casual deepening. It has to be truthful. We have to not be deceived by words. While having a lodging, to not be attached to it. While having food, to keep it simple and just enough, not overdoing it, not so rich in flavor. We have vegetables, daikon or carrots; to cook them so that their own particular flavor comes out. Today we have problems like putting money in a bank, people running off with all the money and the profits that were in that bank for everyone, while our house needs repair and we have no money for things. What will happen to us? Our mind gets confused, and we think about where our life will go, now and later. We have to see clearly that if the heavens and earth really need us, we will be kept alive. We will open in a new way, experience a shift in the way we look at things because of this. We cannot just be superficial and shallow about these matters.</p><p class="P2">Along with the many changes, everyone has great insecurity. But to not be in a hurry, to not be in a commotion, or we will get caught on grasping and grabbing because of our insecurity. Rather, to start anew from the very bottom up: What is important to live in accordance with? To see our clear goal while knowing there is no final answer or ending. There has to be progress, but if we go running around without seeing right where we are standing at every moment, we simply fall over. We have to put our feet firmly on the ground, take one step at a time, focus and attend to where we are with each step.  If we don’t, we just start running around everywhere. Look at computers; there are so many new ones out all the time, brand new computers with new things they can do. Or cars—they come out twice a year—how are they so different, and what is so different about them all? We have to see through these things clearly, or we are going to fall right over, heavily burdened by all of these phenomena. We have to see clearly what, when we get there, will be there. There is nothing at all to seek for in life.</p><p class="P2">In ancient times there was a great scholar in Rome. His name was <span class="indexTerm">Diogenes</span>, and <span class="indexTerm">Alexander the Great</span> always consulted him for his wisdom. Alexander the Great would ask these questions to Diogenes, and Diogenes had no home. He lived in a barrel, which he rolled around, and he would stay in the barrel. One day Alexander the Great asked all of his very important questions to Diogenes and was given answers that were very satisfying for him. He was so thankful when he received the answers of Diogenes, and said, “Please tell me, how can I thank you? What can I possibly do? Build you a research center? Give you all the best things to study from?” But Diogenes said, “No, there is nothing I need, except, um, it’s very cold and you are standing in my sunlight. Could you please move?” Alexander the Great said that, if he could, he would prefer to be Diogenes.</p><p class="P4">40. “At this Vimalakīrti said to those elders’ sons, ‘You would do well to leave home together in the correct Dharma. Why? It is difficult to encounter a time when a buddha is in the world.’ “The elders’ sons said, ‘O retired scholar, we have heard that the Buddha has said one may not leave home without first receiving permission from one’s parents.’</p><p class="P4">“Vimalakīrti said, ‘So it is. You should immediately generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, and this is to “leave home.” This is sufficient.’</p><p class="P4">41. “Then thirty-two elders’ sons all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P2">At that time Vimalakirti said to the young ones to clarify what their life was really about or they would waste their whole precious life. To be head of some big company—we are then run around by and used by that job. What we have to do is to return to that true place of life where we can’t be run around by companies or politics and where we continually put aside other things instead of deepening into our truest self. This brings deepening to all people. He told all of them to become ordained and not waste their precious time, and the young people said: “But the Buddha had said they had to have permission from their parents or they could not be ordained.” To this, Vimalakirti says, “Yes, but true ordination is beyond form; it is making a determined commitment to offer oneself in every way to all people.” Not to be drowning in your own self-satisfaction, but to make efforts to offer everything to all people. To live in accordance with this, having given rise to the deepest Bodhisattva vow: This is the way to realize your deepest Mind. And hearing this, all of them were deeply awakened. And so Rahula said that because of this, he could not go and visit Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P3">Ānanda</p><p class="P4">42. The Buddha told Ānanda, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P2">So finally we come to Ananda Sonja, who was the Buddha’s attendant for twenty-five years. Ananda Sonja was the last of the main disciples, which had started with Makakasho Sonja; all of them had refused to go to see Vimalakirti, even though the Buddha asked each of them. They all knew they would be done in by Vimalakirti and were afraid to bring shame to the Buddha. Each main disciple had their own particular talent. The particular talent of Ananda was that he could remember all the teishos the Buddha had ever given, all the people who had ever come, and everything the Buddha had said over the twenty-five years. He truly had a great memory capacity. They did not write it all down in those days. He was just that way from birth. Also, Ananda was the nephew of the Buddha. Ananda was born the night the Buddha was awakened. His name, Ananda, means joyful. It could be said that Ananda was the Buddha’s awakening. Yet, he himself was never able to realize deep awakening during the time the Buddha was alive. Even though he was with him for twenty-five years and had memorized everything the Buddha said, he still could not awaken. It just happens this way sometimes.</p><p class="P2">Among the disciples there was one whom, after the Buddha died, was very disruptive and who started to say that he was very glad the Buddha was gone now. That noisy boss was dead and gone, and he was glad for it. Now they could do what they wanted to. Well, on hearing this, Ananda was very concerned and called an assembly of all five hundred Arhats, to be able to verify and put together the true teaching of the Buddha before too much time passed. They gathered in the cave called Hiparakutsu, where they were going to meticulously go over everything the Buddha had taught. But they refused to let Ananda into this assembly because he was not awakened and therefore would not understand well enough what it was the Buddha had said. From the moment of being told this, he sat all day and all night long as intensely as possible. And in a few days he was deeply awakened. He went and knocked immediately at the door of the cave and told the Arhats to let him in, that he had awakened. And they said to him, “Well how are you going to prove to us that you have awakened?” Then they told him if he was truly awakened he should be able to go in through the key hole to prove that he had awakened and was no longer caught on dualism. This was simple, and he immediately he went into the key hole. Then he was called in the front of the whole assembly, where he spoke at length of everything that he had ever heard the Buddha say. It was as if he had become the Buddha himself, speaking from that place the Buddha taught from. There he disseminated what he had heard so everyone could hear it all together.</p><p class="P4">Ānanda addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past, the World-honored One had a slight illness requiring cow’s milk [as medicine]. I took my bowl and proceeded to the gateway of a great brahman home.</p><p class="P4">43. “While I was standing there Vimalakīrti came and said to me, ‘O Ānanda, why are you standing here with your bowl so early in the morning?’ “I said, ‘O retired scholar, the World-honored One has a slight illness requiring cow’s milk, and so I have come here.’ “Vimalakīrti said, ‘Stop, stop, Ānanda! Do not speak thus. The Tathāgata’s body is the essence of vajra. [In it] the evils are already eradicated and the host of goods universally assembled. What illness could it have, what vexation could there be?</p><p class="P4">44. “‘Go silently, Ānanda—do not revile the Tathāgata, and do not let anyone else hear such coarse talk. Do not allow the gods of awesome power and virtue and the bodhisattvas who have come from pure lands in other directions to hear these words.</p><p class="P4">“‘Ānanda, even a small degree of blessings (i.e., merit) allows the wheel-turning sage king (cakravartin) to be without illness—how could the immeasurable blessings of the Tathāgata fail to exceed his in every regard?!</p><p class="P4">“‘Go, Ānanda—do not make us experience this shame. If brahmans in the heterodox paths hear this, they will think, “Who is this teacher, who is unable to save himself from illness but would save others of their ills?” Sir, go in secret haste and do not let anyone hear this.</p><p class="P2">Here we have Ananda being asked to go visit Vimalakirti by the Buddha, and Ananda says he just couldn’t do that. And he told the Buddha why: Once the Buddha in his elderly stage had been unable to eat any solids because it was too hard for him to digest at his age. Ananda was afraid that the Buddha would become dehydrated, so he had gone to get some milk for the Buddha. As he was at the house of a person who might give him some milk, Vimalakirti came along and said, “Ananda, what are you doing here so early? The time for takuhatsu is decided.” It is an important thing to be aware of how people are at their houses—when they had finished eating, the monks would go on takuhatsu and might be given the leftovers which would be their food of the day. People gave food for takuhatsu because the monks trained on their behalf as well, and they were deeply appreciative and respectful of that. So the monks had to time this takuhatsu right. They would stand at the gate and then they would receive the food and take it home. After giving some to the Buddha and giving some to those who were sick and could not go out on takuhatsu, everyone would then eat together. But Ananda was there at this house at very early dawn, way before the breakfast preparation could have even begun. Vimalakirti was surprised to see him there. Ananda said, “The Buddha is a little unwell, and he can’t eat solids. And so I thought I might give him some milk.” Vimalakirti said “Stop that right now! Who is it that you think you are taking care of anyway? Where are you looking? That is the body of the Dharma! Don’t do such unnecessary things. You cannot degrade him like that. Who do you think he is? Please go back, immediately. There are bodhisattvas and heavenly beings nearby. You must not let them hear you say such things.”</p><p class="P2">We have the story about Ragorata Sonja, and how at that time as well, we heard that the beings in the heavenly realms don’t get sick; they have too much virtue for that. “Ananda, don’t make fools of these deeply respecting people who think so highly of the Buddha. You make him look as if he can’t even take care of himself and his own physical body, let alone cure others.” Because this had happened to him earlier, </p><p class="P4">45. “‘You should understand, Ānanda, the bodies of the Tathāgatas are bodies of the Dharma, not bodies of longing. The Buddha is the World-honored One, who has transcended the triple world. The Buddha’s body is without flaws, the flaws having been extinguished. The Buddha’s body is unconditioned and does not fit the [conventional] analytic categories. A body such as this—how could it be ill, how could it be vexed?’</p><p class="P4">46. “At the time, World-honored One, I was deeply ashamed that I might have mistakenly heard what the Buddha had said in spite of being so close.”</p><p class="P2">Here we have the Tathagata or Body of the Dharma; there is a physical body and a Dharma body. Of course, they are not two separate things. We have to eat and drink. If we don’t eat, we get sick. If we don’t drink, we get dehydrated; many different symptoms can appear. But, what is it that moves that physical body? This is what has to be seen, or we are thrown around by greed and by anger and by ignorance. As Dogen Zenji says, we are all just a lump of flesh like any animal. We aren’t any different from a four-legged animal. We also were animals at some point in our evolution. But what is it that is alive through our body? This is what we have to see so we can see why we should not be angry and not be greedy. Human darkness comes from these murky places. Humans are very dense. We can use tools maybe, but then we use them to make plutonium so we can blow up the whole planet. </p><p class="P2">We have to see that which is bright and creative in each person. This is humans’ clear activity. We have to move and create from this place. And yet, even though this place is in all of us, we are still conflicting on so many issues all over the globe. We have to leave behind our developed works, not just our ways of being that are destroying the environment. To polish all of our wisdom, and not with a conceptual idea about things, backed up by some learning and dependent on an absolute, but with our very own deepest patience and great wisdom and creativity— to polish and polish and polish our human wisdom! This great wisdom with which we are endowed, that is the body of the Dharma. This is not some special, supernatural power—but to live from this deepest all-embracing wisdom, to see that! If we look at the picture of the Buddha that is traditionally painted for his entering into parinirvana, we can see how many people had gathered there and were in deep sorrow, crying. This was because of their deep grief, not because of their greed and anger. </p><p class="P4">“‘I then heard a voice from space saying, ‘Ānanda, it is as the retired scholar has said. It is just that the Buddha has appeared in this evil age of the five corruptions and manifests this Dharma to emancipate sentient beings.</p><p class="P4">Go, Ānanda. Take the milk without shame.’ </p><p class="P2">We have to see clearly that our eyes may see many things, many objects, but in seeing those objects we can also get caught and pulled around by them. In a hospital, people are not all in the same condition. Some people are very seriously ill and some are not. There are people who have come and found out they had some serious sickness, and then suddenly even after many conclusive tests, that sickness mysteriously disappears. Or someone else who was in such a condition and so worried about their sickness that it just gets worse and worse from all that worrying. Yet there are others in the hospital who give lots of energy to the people who come to visit them in the hospital, and their visitors go home feeling even better than when they first arrived at the hospital. Roshi is always catching a cold, his sickness was so clear, anybody could see it, but he would never say anything. A cold, what? He wasn’t just enduring; it wasn’t that.</p><p class="P2">We have the example of Hakuin Zenji who became very neurotic and sick, and he could hardly keep his life together he was in such bad condition. And so he went to a place in Kyoto called Shirakawa where he met a hermit named Hakuyu. And he got from the hermit Hakuyu certain instructions about how to go about healing the difficult state he was in. The teaching he had received is written about in Yasenkanna or “On the Night Boat.” </p><p class="P2">We have the story of Master Hakuin at age eighty. He was almost on the verge of death, and suddenly he opened his eyes and said, “Well, now I am going to become vigorous.” He said he had just had a dream, and in it he was surrounded by many great teachers and old friends and people of training. And in that dream, this is what had happened: “One of my training friends was there and he said, “You know, I just can’t do continuing clear mind-moments. Could anyone tell me how to do that? Could you please tell me?’” And someone said, “I know how to do that.” And he said, “Please tell me. I really need to know how to do this.’” But the other person of training, his friend of training, said, “Nope, you have to figure it out for yourself.’” To this Hakuin said, “Please, please tell me, I really need to know how to do this to get better.” So the friend said, “Well, then, okay: straight-forward bravery. That’s all there is to it. That’s the only way it will work.” Hakuin was delighted. He said “That’s it! And from now on, that’s just what I’m going to do.” And from the age of eighty, for four more years, he went out over and over again to many great ceremonies, giving teishos, giving sanzen, returning to his former life when he had so much energy and was doing well until age eighty four. </p><p class="P2">He was playing the board game “Go” with a friend who was also a doctor. He asked his friend the doctor to read his pulse and the doctor said, “You’re so healthy, you have no problems whatsoever.” To which Hakuin said, “What are you, a quack doctor? Can’t you tell I’m going to die in three days? You must really be a quack. I’m really going to die in three days.” And in three days from that time he died—gave a great groan and then he died. This is the way of Hakuin Zenji, and this is what Vimalakirti is talking about. “You say he is sick? What are you looking at?” This is the great kindness of Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P4">“‘I then heard a voice from space saying, ‘Ānanda, it is as the retired scholar has said. It is just that the Buddha has appeared in this evil age of the five corruptions and manifests this Dharma to emancipate sentient beings.</p><p class="P4">Go, Ānanda. Take the milk without shame.’</p><p class="P2">But at that time, a voice from the sky spoke to Ananda telling him to take the milk. The world is so polluted and full of commotion, this what Vimalakirti is teaching, this is what the Buddha is showing you and why he is sick also. A heavenly voice spoke and told him to accept that milk and take it home to the Buddha.</p><p class="P2">This toxic world that humans have created, how can anyone benefit?</p><p class="P2">The world is a place of the <span class="indexTerm">five corruptions</span>. The first of these corruptions is how we are falling into convenience, but that convenience creates things like Freon gas that is filling the air and killing people.  Carbon dioxide from the exhaust of all of our vehicles is polluting our whole planet. It is not by chance that we have all kinds of environmental accidents and crises occurring right now, given our desire for convenience above all else.  </p><p class="P2">The second of the corruption is that this world is full of suffering, and we think that it can be cured by some kind of medical intervention. Of course, the medical field has many ways to lengthen our lives. But this is not a cure shared with the poor who get so sick and so degenerated. </p><p class="P2">The third corruption is the extremes of desire. The desire to stay alive is an instinct, which is a natural desire. But the desire for other things is growing exponentially. The fourth is that humans think themselves to be the best, the highest form at this point of evolution. Instead of taking that as our responsibility and taking care of all beings, humans use it to be proud and haughty and wallow in all these desires! The fifth corruption is doing things for fame and money. Only a few very rich people on the planet have whatever they want; meanwhile how many are poor and suffering because of this? Vimalakirti says that the Buddha is not sick, that society is sick. Vimalakirti also said he himself is not sick; it is all the people that are sick, and that is the only reason why he is ailing. We have to see how we are living and how it affects others. It is in this way that we are taught by Vimalakirti’s great kindness. </p><p class="P4">47. “World-honored One, the eloquence of Vimalakīrti’s wisdom is like this. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P4">48. In similar fashion all of the Buddha’s five hundred great disciples each explained their original encounters and related what Vimalakīrti had said, and each said he was unable to accept [the Buddha’s instruction] to go inquire about [Vimalakīrti’s] illness.</p><p class="P2">In the same way, the rest of the five hundred disciples were reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti. Each told the Buddha his own adventure, recounting his conversations with the Licchavi Vimalakirti.</p><p class="P2">To manifest this great way of the Mayahana, Vimalakirti was teaching in this way.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1">Poem closing the Sesshin:</p><p class="P5">The training period successfully completed,</p><p class="P5">Buddha now distinguished —<br/>right and wrong, <br/>good and bad, <br/>gain and loss <br/>— conflict resolved.</p><p class="P5">Each song, each clap of the hands has infinite meaning;<br/>even in this muddy world, we feel the yearning to help.</p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
