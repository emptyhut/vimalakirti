Vimalakirti had taken the form of being sick himself in order to teach people that they will not be healthy forever. Even a young person may encounter an accident. We may lose one of our eyes. We all imagine we have a tomorrow, so we live today so casually. But we mustn’t be deceived like this. To teach people this very lesson, Vimalakirti has taken on this appearance of being a person who is sick. The king and the top officials have all come to visit Vimalakirti, repaying their deep debt and gratitude for the grace he has given them. </p><p class="P3">The Buddha as well, since he had heard that Vimalakirti was sick, attempted to send his disciples to see Vimalakirti; but of course the Buddha, with his deeply seeing mind’s eye, knew very well that Vimalakirti was teaching through that appearance of being sick. He had been teaching relentlessly that we cannot be interested only in our own personal needs and our own individual good fortune. We have to continually keep our focus on what is best for all society, and this is what Vimalakirti was also teaching with his being sick as well. All of the Buddha’s disciples had at one time or another been called on the carpet by Vimalakirti for the weaknesses in their training or their teaching. So when the Buddha asked them to go visit Vimalakirti in his sick bed, even the closest disciples of the Buddha refused the Buddha’s request, and none of them would go to visit him. Since the top disciples wouldn’t go to see Vimalakirti, the Buddha turns to the bodhisattvas and begins to ask if there isn’t a bodhisattva who would please go and visit the Vimalakirti: </p><p class="P6">1. At this point the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva, “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P3">In the previous chapter, the Buddha was requesting his ten top disciples to visit the ailing Vimalakirti and was refused by each of them. Each one gave a reason for turning down the request. This time the Buddha begins to ask the bodhisattvas. The first of these is Maitreya, or Miroku bodhisattva. </p><p class="P7">The Buddha said this at the end of his life. “After I die, my many disciples, one after another, will continue. If they continue transmitting the truth and giving life to their training, even if my body is gone, the Dharma Body of the Tathagatha will be living forever. If the Dharma does not decay, I will be living right there. Those who see the Dharma will see me, and those who see me will see the Dharma. In this way, the Buddha taught. To put it another way, each and every one of us must be Maitreya.</p><p class="P7">The Buddha said that 5,670,000,000 years after his death Maitreya will be realized in this world and will liberate those who have not yet been liberated by him. It was prophesied that Maitreya would be the Buddha of the next age.</p><p class="P7">Maitreya was the bodhisattva that the Buddha promised to send to the world in the following age, and even now in the Tusita heavens, Maitreya continues training for all beings. Maitreya was asked to go to Vimalakirti by the Buddha, and he turned down the request. </p><p class="P6">Maitreya addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once in the past when I was explaining the practice of the stage of irreversibility for the heavenly king of the Tuṣita Heaven and his subordinates. At the time Vimalakīrti came and said to me,</p><p class="P6">2. “‘Maitreya, the World-honored One has bestowed on your noble person the prediction that you will achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi in a single lifetime. What lifetime will you use to experience this prediction, past, future, or present? If a past life, then the past life is already extinguished. If a future life, then the future life has not arrived.</p><p class="P3">You are teaching about there being just one life left. That is the way of the Arhat. But, what about that one life? Is that a one life that has happened already in the past? Is that the one life that we are living right now? Is that the one life that will happen in the future? Vimalakirti<span class="T2">’s teaching here is reflective of an aspect in the Theravadin tradition, where it is taught that there are many people who have only a single rebirth before they become a Buddha, and then one would be an Arhat who has only a single birth left. They would become what is called a non-returner. Maitreya had said that an Arhat has only one more life. But here, this is what Vimalakirti is saying: The life that is left</span>— is this a life of the past? Is this a life of the present? Is this a life of the future?</p><p class="P6">If the present life, then the present life is non-abiding. It is as the Buddha has explained, “O bhikṣus, you are in this immediate present born, aged, and extinguished.”</p><p class="P6">“‘If you experience this prediction with birthlessness, then the birthless is the primary status [of Hinayanist enlightenment]. Yet within that primary status there is no receiving the prediction, and also no attainment of anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P6">3. “‘How, Maitreya, did you receive the prediction of [buddhahood in] a single lifetime? Did you receive the prediction from the generation of suchness, or did you receive the prediction from the extinction of suchness?</p><p class="P3">Here we have this teaching of Vimalakirti on non-abiding. In one moment, we intend to be reborn in the future, but this is never possible. Awakening is only possible in this present moment. To be claiming that we will be able to experience this in a moment of the past or in a moment of the future makes no sense. We can only be sharp and awake and ready in this very present moment. However, if that past is clarified, then we are more likely to be able to sharpen this moment; not to be caught on a hope of awakening in the future, as if that is going to make it happen. If it is something we hold in our imagination or feel in a vague way like a memory, if it is caught and perceived in this way, it is nothing but the imagining of the superficial thing.</p><p class="P3">You must not cease in your constant, focused application. Even a small bit of water falling one drop at a time, such as water dripping from the eaves onto a stone below, wears away the stone drop by drop. If each time you look away from that and say to yourself, “Oh I wish it was like this”, or “Oh why can’t it be just like that”, the essence will get diluted and you’ll let go of it all completely. It is just like making a spark with two sticks. We rub the sticks together and keep rubbing without stopping to get the heat that can then bring forth a spark. Then finally, with the friction of the sticks rubbing against each other there will be smoke, and the spark will come forth and start the paper scraps burning, and a fire can be built. If as you do it you are always stopping and resting as you do it, no matter how great a deep vow you have, the goal will not be able to be realized. To do it without ceasing and keep the efforts going all the way to completion is what is called making true efforts. This is the <span class="indexTerm">paramita of deep effort</span>.</p><p class="P3">It has been said that to think nothing at all is the state of mind of the Buddha, but to sustain that in every single <span class="indexTerm">nen</span> is very difficult to do. We do zazen, planning to sit and think about nothing at all, but one mind-moment after the next, things come and go, the thoughts continually arising and departing. This is not the state of continuous clear mind-moments. People have so many various experiences, so many things they take refuge in, so many memories of the past. We have to let go of all of that, to no longer feel any need to be associated with any of that. Instead, we need to become absorbed in our deepest interior and realize the place where we extend throughout the heavens and earth as one single layer. This is the state of mind of being a person who is mute and can’t tell his or her dream. We understand very well, but we cannot communicate this state of mind to anyone else. This essence can’t be expressed. We have realized this place where our state of mind cannot be known in any conceptual way because it is beyond any dualistic perception. In that place all past history and superficial knowledge and social conditioning is let go of completely. This is what it is to directly encounter our true nature.</p><p class="P6">“‘If you received the prediction by the generation of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without generation. If you received the prediction by the extinction of suchness, then [understand that] suchness is without extinction.</p><p class="P6">“‘All sentient beings are entirely suchlike, and all dharmas are also entirely suchlike. The assembly of sages and wise ones are also such-like.</p><p class="P6">Even you, Maitreya, are suchlike. If you received the prediction [of future buddhahood], all sentient beings should also receive it. Why? Suchness is nondual and nondifferentiated. If Maitreya attains anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, then all sentient beings should also all attain it. Why? All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi. If Maitreya attains extinction, then all sentient beings should also all [attain] extinction. Why? The buddhas understand that all sentient beings are ultimately extinguished, which is the characteristic of nirvana, and cannot again be extinguished.</p><p class="P6">“‘Therefore, Maitreya, do not inspire the gods with this teaching.</p><p class="P6">4. “‘Truly, there is no one who generates the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, and there is no one who retrogresses. Maitreya, you should have these gods forsake this discriminative view of bodhi. </p><p class="P3">These ideas of there being a certain moment of realization and it having certain characteristics—do not deceive people in this way, Maitreya, because there is no such thing as an ability to acknowledge an Enlightenment. When one can let go of and forget all of those concepts, then and only then, can one exist purely in this moment. We cannot perceive it from a delusive point of view, that it has a moment when it arises and then a moment when it is no longer arising, when it regresses.</p><p class="P6">Why? “‘Bodhi cannot be attained with the body, and it cannot be attained with the mind.</p><p class="P6">“‘Extinction is bodhi, because of the extinction of the characteristics. “‘Non-contemplation is bodhi, because it transcends the conditions. “‘Non-practice is bodhi, because it is without recollection. “‘Eradication is bodhi, because of renouncing the views. Transcendence is bodhi, because of the transcendence of false concepts.”</p><p class="P3">We have the story of Master <span class="indexTerm">Bankei</span>: Our mind is from the origin free of any kind of distinctive characteristics. We don’t need to add on anything to that to make it ‘more clear’. It is already clear. We are naturally in a place of serenity, and we don’t need to add anything to that. Bankei Zenji was always teaching this very point: that we are in all states of mind, an unborn mind. Once, a man came forward and said, “If I am unborn mind, then will you please help me get rid of this terribly impatient, irritated state of mind that I always feel?” And to this, Master Bankei said, “Well then just put that state of mind right out there, and I will take care of it for you.” And he said, “Well how can I? I don’t have this state of mind unless I’m irritated by something.” To which Master Bankei said, “See, it is not something which you have. If you cannot put it out there and show it, then it cannot truly exist. Even if it comes forth at some time, it is not actual.” In that way, he was teaching how there is no such thing as a quality or a character of a state of mind. There is only that clear, bright state of mind with which we are born from the origin. </p><p class="P3">Then Vimalakirti says to Maitreya how we are all undivided and without dualism in our mind from the origin, so we do not need to make any such efforts to become that way. In the beginning, all people are clear. But if we have added things on, believing we are of this quality and have that characteristic, we make efforts to let go of those deluded ideas. To do that we have to make great efforts, not to become that clear mind but to let go of what we have constructed and added on to what our clear mind already is.</p><p class="P6">“‘Hindrances are bodhi, because of the hindrance of the vows. “‘Non-entry is bodhi, because of the absence of lustful attachment.</p><p class="P6">Accordance is bodhi, because of accordance with suchness. “‘Abiding is bodhi, because of abiding [in the] Dharma-nature. “‘Approach is bodhi, because of the approach to the reality-limit. “‘Nonduality is bodhi, because of the transcendence of mind and dharmas. “‘Universal sameness is bodhi, because of universal sameness with space. “‘The unconditioned is bodhi, because of the absence of generation, abiding, and extinction. “‘Understanding is bodhi, because of the comprehension of the mental processes of sentient beings. “‘Non-assemblage is bodhi, because of the non-assemblage of the entrances (āyatanas, i.e., sensory capacities). “‘Non-aggregation is bodhi, because of the transcendence of the latent influences of the afflictions.”</p><p class="P3">This is what he then says: To not add on any ideas about what it is to awaken. To not hold on to anything called an awakening. To not be attached to anything whatsoever. To not add on to one’s direct perceptions, second associations and third associations. Don’t hold on to any idea about how hard you are working. That is all extra. To just sit and not be caught on an idea of sitting, an idea of doing it, an idea of doing anything. That is what makes it so difficult. To just stand in whatever world we are rolled into. Wherever we are tossed, we fall over, we stand again. Just don’t give rise to thoughts about it all. Don’t give in to making extra associations to whatever you perceive. That water which flows freely, whether it encounters huge boulders, whether it encounters tree trunks with great roots swinging from them, it just keeps flowing past. Be free from being caught on anything at all. Everything we see, hear, and feel is then the truth, because we are not caught on our ideas about things that we are perceiving and experiencing or by our second associations to those ideas. Be whatever comes, just as it is. </p><p class="P6">“‘The non-locative is bodhi, because of formlessness. “‘Provisional names are bodhi, because names are empty. “‘The [activities of the] conversion of suchness are bodhi, because of the nonexistence of grasping and forsaking. “‘The non-turbulent is bodhi, because of permanent composure. “‘Good serenity is bodhi, because of the purity of the natures. “‘Non-grasping is bodhi, because of the transcendence of objectified mentation. “‘Non-differentiation is bodhi, because of the universal sameness of the dharmas. “‘Non-comparison is bodhi, because of the impossibility of analogy. “‘The subtle is bodhi, because of the difficulty of understanding the dharmas.’ </p><p class="P3">In all the boundless realms of space, not even a single hair can be inserted. From the endless past to the limitless future, we are never separated from this very moment. To be matched in each thing that we do, to perfectly fit with every single moment, to do things and not be caught on any idea of doing them. To not be caught on an idea of doing something or of seeing results or of seeing if we have any ideas about what our senses are perceiving. If we add on these ideas, we are just getting caught on the ideas and are then unable to perceive what we are actually seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling. To be able to see that we are this awakening without any idea of having been one who has been an awakened one! </p><p class="P3">Whether we are playing a violin, a piano, or a guitar, we don’t give attention to those hands, noticing what our hands are doing. Forget them completely, and become that playing only. There is no need to think about those things that have names. Those things were never there from the origin. We have the story of Helen Keller, who until she was in her thirties never knew that things had names, and how amazed she was when she discovered for the first time that each thing had a name. To know things prior to their even being named. To not be caught on ownership or on dualism about an idea, or about a thing and its actuality. To go above those <span class="indexTerm">clouds</span> with which mental ideas obstruct our pure experience. Go above those clouds to where that sun has never stopped shining in that bright sky. </p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti shows us how our mind is what is always bringing things in to obstruct us from seeing things clearly. When children are first born, for their first three years, they couldn’t be deluded even if they tried to be; they don’t yet have the self-conscious awareness necessary to see in a dualist way. In the future, even when Maitreya is said to be going to come back and liberate others, it is only the state of mind that people have constructed, not that mind with which they were originally endowed, that will need helping. For people to be able to have what they need materially may require help from others, but the state of mind of each person is, from the origin, awakened. The only difficulty is that we have added on extra things and ideas and names to that state of mind. That is not a sickness. It is only an idea of having added something extra which was never there in the first place. This is what Vimalakirti was saying to Maitreya and is instructing us here. </p><p class="P3">As the sixth patriarch has said in his definition of zazen, to bring no thoughts of good and bad to what we perceive externally, and to hold on to none of our concerns within. To not be moved around by anything that comes up internally or from the outside. This is the sixth patriarch’s way of defining zazen. We encounter so many things daily, and then we add on all the dualistic perceptions to them, infinitely. We are continually describing them to ourselves, adding on to what we taste and feel and touch. Rather to simply taste, feel and touch. This is what zazen is. Zazen is not a form of a certain sitting posture. It is to not be stopped by any kind of idea or experience; it is that which flows through all of it. However, we are always being caught by things, and that means getting stopped. All of those things we are getting caught by are like momentary bubbles, like foam. To not get stopped by any of those, instead see directly that the mind holds on to nothing whatsoever—that is original self. We sit zazen to bring our awareness to serenity and not add on any unnecessary thoughts; we learn how to not give away our attention to extraneous things in any <span class="indexTerm">mind-moment</span>. It is most important to have no gaps in our focused awareness; it is in those gaps that the egoistic view slips in. This is what is most important. </p><p class="P3">Keeping our lower abdomen firm and breathing from there, we exhale completely. And in doing that we become freed from that thinking. Without any gaps, we do one breath after the next, and our mind of itself becomes clearer and clearer, empty of any extra thinking. We ourselves are making those efforts to not get pulled away from our focus. There is no one else who can do this for us because, from the origin, this is our natural way of being, our natural state of mind. In each moment, we are right here and right now. We have to gather and strengthen this experience to the point where it does not matter any more if people are insulting us or praising us. Who believes any more that someone else is going to save them? If we are not pushed around by the phenomena that are external or that we hold onto from within, then we cannot be deceived. In our true state of mind we simply do not add on anything extra, from inside or outside. To have only that moment’s perception, which is clear. In this way we continue without being pulled away from our focused awareness.</p><p class="P6">5. “World-honored One, when Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, two hundred gods achieved the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.” </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2">Kogon<br/>Doji</p><p class="P6">6. The Buddha told Kogon Doji (“Radiance Ornament Youth” or Prabhavyuha), “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.” Radiance Ornament Youth addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness.” </p><p class="P3">Today, we have Kogon Doji being asked by the Buddha to go visit Vimalakirti. Yesterday, the Buddha had asked Maitreya to go, but Maitreya had been challenged and put down by Vimalakirti and did not want to go visit him. The Buddha predicted that in the next era, millions of years from now, Maitreya would attain buddhahood and liberate all those who had not yet been liberated. This had been prophesized from times of old, but it was said he would liberate people in the faraway future. Vimalakirti asked Maitreya, with what mind he would be liberating others—the mind of the past, the present, or the future. Of course, he was using Maitreya to be able to teach about that deeper truth of the Mahayana. Vimalakirti implied that this prophecy was just something put forth to soothe everyone, and, in fact, that is not the point. Rather, each person has to be totally and completely in this present moment for there to be any real liberation. That is the source of the wisdom of the Mahayana Way and the cure for people’s suffering. So Maitreya was reluctant to go to visit the Vimalakirti, and he turned the Buddha down. </p><p class="P3">So next, the Buddha asks Kogon Doji to go and visit Vimalakirti. “Doji” means a person who is like a child. But that truly is saying that Kogon Doji is someone who is so single-minded in their absorption or focus—like a child at play—that they don’t know what direction they are facing, or what event happening the next day. This was the nature of Kogon Doji, who was one of the bodhisattvas. In a place of practice, to enter a dojo with that kind of trusting, wholehearted application of energy is very important for being able to realize and fulfill one’s training. To have that kind of single-mindedness is not so unusual, but to simultaneously have excellent ki energy along with that single-mindedness is necessary to be strong and realize the path. To be devoted to realizing the truth directly no matter what happens and above everything else! Kogon Doji, like Maitreya before him, is reluctant to go visit the Vimalakirti because he also had been severely cautioned by Vimalakirti previously.</p><p class="P3">So here, Kogon Doji tells why he does not want to go visit Vimalakirti. This section is being used to teach what a dojo actually is. A dojo is usually understood as a place of practice, a place where monks train. Sogenji, for example, is considered a dojo. That is the usual way of looking at what a dojo is. However, Vimalakirti, teaching of the Mahayana, is not talking about a dojo as a location or a place where monks with shaved heads live in a cloistered area. Rather, to be in the very midst of life—a family life, a life in the world—yet while being in the midst of that life, to not give rise to any unnecessary thoughts. This is the truer meaning of a dojo, a place where we never leave the truth and we never separate from the practice. It means not a location or a place, but a state of mind where we do not let go of our practice, where we are not entertaining extraneous thinking. </p><p class="P3">Kogon Doji says to the Buddha, “In the olden days I was going out from Vaisali’s gate. Vimalakirti was just coming in the gate. For me to see the great layperson Vimalakirti, I, of course, did appropriate greetings and I said to him, “Vimalakirti, where are you coming back from?” And he said, “I am coming from the dojo.” I thought, “How strange this is.” The Amorha-An, the dojo where the Buddha had taught monks, is inside the city of Vaisali, and so I asked him, “What dojo are you returning from?” To this he answered, “This dojo of clear, straight-forward honest mind, a mind which doesn’t deceive itself. This is the dojo.” These are famous words often quoted from the Vimalakiti sutra as a Zen phrase. The straightforward honest mind is the dojo. A clear sincere mind, a mind that does not deceive itself, a pure and honest mind. No matter where we are, no matter where we go, we cannot separate from this clear, innocent state of mind. No matter what location we are in, we have to be present in this state of mind. It cannot be a mind of dualism.</p><p class="P6">“Why? I remember once in the past, when I was coming out of the great city of Vaiśālī just as Vimalakīrti was entering the city. I immediately bowed and asked, ‘Retired scholar, from where are you coming?’</p><p class="P6">“He answered me, ‘I have come from the place of enlightenment.’ “I asked, ‘Where is the place of enlightenment?’ </p><p class="P3">A dojo is a place where there is no hesitation or stagnation of the flow. From morning until night, night until morning, our state of mind cannot be stopped or caught, but must be without gaps and without pauses. This is because in our everyday life and work, that living, flowing state of mind enables us to see how best to do things: to make decisions and act in a natural way that results in the best work. To follow this, to carefully stay in this fresh, ongoing flow, or we get caught. We get up, we do chanting, we do zazen, we do sanzen, we clean, we eat, without any break or stopping in between. We continue without a break, and as we get used to it we see this is the best way to live and to work. When we are taking a rest, to rest completely. When we are working, to work totally and completely. The deep profound mind is the dojo. This reference to the deep and profound mind is also something from the Vimalakirti sutra, which is frequently quoted in Zen phrases. </p><p class="P3">The dojo is that very determination to put others’ liberation ahead of our own. To work for others without ceasing, and that is simultaneously the polishing of our own deepest wisdom and state of mind. We vow to offer to everyone, while continuing to polish and deepen our own understanding. This is the deep vow state of mind of the bodhisattva. These have to be realized: that place which is the dojo, which is the honest mind. That place which is the dojo, which is that purified mind. That place which is the dojo, which is the mind of all offering and all efforts given for the liberation of all other beings, even ahead of our own deep liberation. All of these beings realized is the dojo. Deepen to the place where we are practicing continuously, without any sense of even practicing. This state of mind in which being empathetic and compassionate with all living beings is our prime concern—this is the way of the bodhisattva, and this state of mind is the dojo.</p><p class="P6">7. “‘Sincerity is the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of falsity. The generation of practice is the place of enlightenment, because it is able to discriminate things. Profound mind is the place of enlightenment, because of the increase in merit. The mind of bodhi (bodhicitta) is the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of error.</p><p class="P6">8. “‘Charity is the place of enlightenment, because of not seeking after retribution (i.e., reward). Morality is the place of enlightenment, because of the fulfillment of vows. Forbearance is the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of any mental hindrance regarding sentient beings. Exertion is the place of enlightenment, because of not retrogressing. Meditation is the place of enlightenment, because of the pliable disciplining of the mind. Wisdom is the place of enlightenment, because of the manifest perception of the dharmas.</p><p class="P3">The six paramitas are given next. Observing the precepts is the way of practicing to realize that deep state of mind, which is the dojo. To know the way of offering everything to all people, yet to have no attachment to being acknowledged or to being good. To be dedicated in our efforts and devoted to our good deeds without being egoistically involved in them; to be deeply concentrated in our work, and to have wisdom. To be unafraid and courageous is often understood as being patient, but in this case read it as being huge and all-embracing in our state of mind. For example, to not be peeved or bothered by someone being insulting or condescending; we cannot do truly big work if we are brought down by somebody’s small-minded attempts to bother us. To be serene, to be deeply concentrated, and to have wisdom. These are all ways of being in that state of mind, which is the true dojo. </p><p class="P6">9. “‘Sympathy is the place of enlightenment, because of the universal sameness of sentient beings. Compassion is the place of enlightenment, because of the forbearance of suffering. Joy is the place of enlightenment, because of taking pleasure in the Dharma. Equanimity is the place of enlightenment, because of the eradication of repugnance and affection.</p><p class="P3">Next, we have the <span class="indexTerm">four infinite states of mind</span>. The first of these is what is called compassion, the quality attributed to the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. In this case, compassion is described as having two parts to it: bringing someone relief through the application of kindness, and taking away their pain. This is what Avalokitesvara is known to be able to do: to bring someone relief and at the same time to take away their pain. This description of compassion as having two facets is like the sun coming up at dawn. When the sun comes up at dawn into the deep, black night, then one by one the things that are present are able to be discriminated and seen clearly, which brings us great relief because in the darkness we cannot see. </p><p class="P3">The sun has the quality of light and at the same time it also has the quality of heat. And so does compassion. Compassion helps us to see, but it also contains the aspect of wisdom. To have both of these together in one: to know how to be comforting, but also to have the wisdom to take away the pain. When both of these parts are present, it is the nature of the compassion and wisdom of Avalokitesvara. That same heat which comes from the strong sunshine can also burn parts of the planet. But wisdom and compassion are both essential for human beings to be able to deepen in their process of realizing awakening. These are not learned mentally. Rather, wisdom and compassion are acquired by becoming them and working with them to help others. </p><p class="P3">The dojo is this way of being compassionate. It is also the place of knowing and sharing and experiencing the joy of all beings, and not just human beings, but plants and animals as well. To know their joy, to support their joy, to live in a way that continues their joy. We so often forget how it is not just humans but all beings that are involved in this life. In order to see this and know how to become it, we must forget our small-self and our small-self-centered lives. To live a life of love for the fulfillment of all beings in the best possible way! These are the four states of mind of infinite goodness.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti says, if we can realize this state of mind, then we will also know the best way to live ethically.</p><p class="P6">10. “‘The numinous penetrations are the place of enlightenment, because of the achievement of the six penetrations (i.e., supernatural abilities). Emancipation is the place of enlightenment, because of the ability to forsake. Skillful means are the place of enlightenment, because of the salvation of sentient beings. The four means of attraction are the place of enlightenment, because of the attraction (i.e., conversion) of sentient beings. Erudition is the place of enlightenment, because of practice according to one’s knowledge. Mental control is the place of enlightenment, because of the correct contemplation of the dharmas. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the place of enlightenment, because of forsaking the conditioned dharmas. The truth is the place of enlightenment, because of not misleading the world.”</p><p class="P3">All of these are accomplished by having nothing deceiving or obstructing our clear sight. Then we naturally know all of these ways of being, and we know omniscience and the various kinds of super-knowledges. We have to open our mind totally for true rebirth. It is not about getting caught on delusive phenomena and conceptual ideas of being reborn in some special, new way. It is accomplished by way of using the expedient means which are taught by Vimalakirti, such as charitable behavior, kind words, loving expression, working together at all kinds of jobs no matter how difficult they might be. To do these all, and to do them without any murkiness; to guide others in society in good works and help them align so they are able to do these various thirty-seven kinds of excellent activities. All of these can be seen clearly when we are living from our deepest state of mind, as well as understanding the twelve links of causation and the other ways of how things work. To be able to see these from a deep clear mind is the way of the dojo. </p><p class="P6">“‘Conditioned generation is the place of enlightenment, because ignorance and so forth through old age and death, (the twelve steps of dependent origination) are all unexhausted. The afflictions are bodhi, because of understanding according to actuality.</p><p class="P3">Continuing with all the various qualities of what it is to be in the state of mind which is the dojo: To help many people, to eradicate desires, to not be moved around, to instead be centered in deepest wisdom. As master <span class="indexTerm">Hakuin</span> has said in his Song of Zazen:</p><p class="P3"> “Even those who have sat zazen only once will see all karma erased. Nowhere will they find evil paths, and the Pure Land will not be far away. If we listen even once with open heart to this truth, then praise it and gladly embrace it, how much more so then if on reflecting within ourselves we directly realize Self-nature, giving proof to the truth that Self-nature is no nature. We will have gone far beyond idle speculation.” </p><p class="P3">No matter in what world we might find ourselves, to have no fear. To know, to see from a place of courage and to forget ourselves completely. To accept and receive whatever comes to us in any situation. To be able to know the serenity which that courage brings. For this, we do sesshin. Even though our legs hurt and we have so much to do in our outside lives, we come here. We come here to be able to drink all of it down, to know the abundance of realizing it all, and to know how to be clear in each and every mind-moment.</p><p class="P3"> We realize this in every moment here. At the beginning, we have a hard time. We are in darkness, because we are unripe. But we have to pass through that darkness with deep courage, with determination, until that small-self is not what is moving us around anymore. The small-self is so easily moved around by everything it encounters. Because we ripen in a larger perspective, we are able to know a place where we are no longer moved around. We are not under the influence of the small-self’s shadow anymore. It does not linger. We have to center in this way of being whole-hearted. And in this way we have the words of the sixth patriarch who tells us how: </p><p class="P3">“To anything we perceive externally, we add no ideas of good and bad. And to whatever is arising within, we give it no acknowledgment.”</p><p class="P3">The <span class="indexTerm">Sixth Patriarch</span> has given a definition of zazen. “Za” means to not give rise to any thoughts of good or bad whatsoever, concerning external matters. Everything in the external world is dualistic. There are good things and bad things, smart people and foolish people, sick people and healthy people. These are all dualistic, in a world of good and bad. We have to cut all of that and to see everything directly without taking our eye off of it: to not be repulsed by it or afraid of it, to see it clearly and directly just as a mirror takes in everything that comes to it. A mirror does not get at all confused by what is reflected in it; it does not give rise to any thoughts about what is being reflected there at all. To not be wandering in our mind or be confused and deluded at all, this is the “Za” of zazen, according to the Sixth Patriarch. It is not our physical body alone that sits zazen, it is our mind. No matter what problem may arise in the world around us, it is nothing more than a reflection in a mirror. A mirror reflects all things and in the same way a mind reflects everything that comes to it, while being caught on nothing. This is the definition of “Za”. Living zazen is defined here.</p><p class="P3">To look directly within and be unmoved by anything; this is the “Zen”, of zazen. As the Sixth Patriarch’s famous words say, “From the origin there is not a single thing, where is there anyplace for any speck to land?” In our mind there is, from the origin, nothing whatsoever, not a single speck of anything to hold on to or to be recognized; this is our true nature. In our mind we reflect all worlds, but are caught on none of them. We go beyond all dualism and we drink down everything. We realize the world in this way. If we don’t become like this we cannot correctly reflect the world. It is said in the Bible that God sends rain equally to good and bad people. We function in the same way, whatever it is, just as it is. We drink it all down, the good and the bad; we receive and accept all things.</p><p class="P3"> This pure mind is the dojo. This deep compassion is the dojo. This clear and infinite serenity, this is the dojo. </p><p class="P6">11. “‘Sentient beings are the place of enlightenment, because of understanding no-self.</p><p class="P6">“‘All dharmas are the place of enlightenment, because of understanding the emptiness of the dharmas. Subjugation of the Māras is the place of enlightenment, because of not being swayed. The triple world is the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of destinations. The lion’s roar is the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of fear. The [ten] powers, [four] fearlessnesses, and [eighteen] exclusive attributes are the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of transgressions. The three illuminations are the place of enlightenment, because of the absence of remaining hindrances. To understand all the dharmas in a single moment of thought is the place of enlightenment, because of the accomplishment of omniscience.</p><p class="P3">And this ongoing patience, this is the dojo. We can’t cover our eyes and ears and senses and call that being alive. Rather, to realize everything that comes in each moment from an unmoved center. This is the way. This is an all-embracing abundance. This is the way we become if we don’t get stuck in ritual, if we are not caught on the form of practice. Rather, know and be the way of straightforward honesty, which is the dojo. Know the way of being compassionate, which is the dojo. Be in that profound state of mind, free of any speck of extraneous thought, which is the dojo. This is the way of the bodhisattva. Realize this fully.</p><p class="P6">12. “‘Thus, my good man, should the bodhisattva teach sentient beings according to the perfections. In all that is done, [down to every] lifting or placing of one’s foot, you should understand that all these come from the place of enlightenment and abide in the Buddha-Dharma.’</p><p class="P3">In this way, from every possible angle, Vimalakirti teaches what a place of enlightenment is, and finally he describes how all action is for the liberation for all beings. In Zen there are the words “<span class="T3">Sitting in the moon-water dojo, doing practices like empty flowers in the air</span>.” [ZS] The moon reflected in the water is so beautiful; yet the moon has no awareness of being reflected in that water, nor does the water have any awareness of reflecting the moon. The moon is not attached to the water, and the water is not attached to the moon. This state of mind, this is the place of enlightenment. No matter what problem comes up in our daily life, to not be pulled around and not become attached to it, but to keep flowing. Like a flowing river, our mind keeps moving; this is the place of enlightenment.</p><p class="P3">We have a daily life of work and responsibility in the world. To live within that, yet to not lose our precious aligned mind: this is the way of doing zazen and is the true transmission of Buddha nature. From the Buddha down through Daruma, the true way of doing zazen is not to go into the mountains and retreat. It is to be always aligned in our daily life, whether we are standing or sitting or walking or talking. The true transmission of Buddha nature is to continue doing zazen without interruption, whether we are waking or sleeping.</p><p class="P3">So the ancients said: to sit is Zen, to move is Zen, to speak is Zen, to be silent is Zen, to be in action is Zen, and to be still is Zen. When the mind is clear, everything is Zen. When we are eating we become eating completely, when we are working we become working completely, when we are sleeping we become sleeping completely, and doing zazen we become zazen.</p><p class="P3">In this way we are able to let go of extraneous thoughts, and our whole life becomes zazen: within zazen we live, within zazen we work, within zazen we sleep. Our whole life becomes zazen. This is the true way of “the straightforward mind is the enlightened place”.</p><p class="P3">We need to do osesshin together because when we come together, leaving our busy lives temporarily behind, then we can sharply place our focus within each of footstep and hand motion. With every one of our 360 smallest joints, our 84,000 hair pores, we bring focus to each motion, to each foot-step. We bring each and every one of our cells into focus. Each cell is an eye. Every single activity, every single moment, every single thing we do is the seeing eye—that state of mind which sees and perceives clearly in each moment. Of course this is the focus in zazen, but also keep this going when working, and resting as well. </p><p class="P3">People say, and [the Roshi] hears this often, that when they leave the zendo for a long time they often find that their focus deteriorates. After being in the world for a while, they need to return to do <span class="indexTerm">zazen</span> and polish their sharp cutting edge, and cut away the extraneous thinking. Otherwise, we become scrambled and scattered. So we return to do osesshin, which is an opportunity to sharpen and polish the blade. At Tahoma-san Sogenji, we polish and polish and polish, and we gather together a full tautness, we get rid of the extraneous thinking that is obstructing our clear view. This cannot be done conceptually, it has to be done with each motion, with each touch. We bring our full tautness to it, and we cut everything away completely. It is not the form of sitting that is important for this, but the sharp cutting edge. And with this, we can realize this place of clarity, which is the dojo. This is what Vimalakirti is speaking of as the dojo and our true functioning. </p><p class="P6">13. “When [Vimalakīrti] explained the Dharma five hundred gods and humans all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2">Jisai<br/></p><p class="P3">Today, we have the third section of the Bodhisattva chapter in which the Buddha asks Jisai bodhisattva (“Maintains the World” or Jagatimdhara) to visit Vimalakirti. In this chapter, the Vimalakirti Sutra teaches how to hold our mind while living in society. In the preceding chapter the disciples visit Vimalakirti; there the teaching was how we can’t hold on to our own awakening and good fortune for only our own personal sake. If we hold on only to our own good fortune, then we will not be able to help bring others to realize enlightenment. The Buddha was awakened and immediately he taught his disciples the way to realize awakening. This is the start of the way of the Mahayana, and this is the way of the bodhisattva. The bodhisattvas are countless, and they are everywhere doing training, and living in society. Those in society who vow to give up everything for the liberation of all people in society, these are the bodhisattvas. This is what it means to live without dualism. </p><p class="P3">Jisai bodhisattva was living in the midst of a society where access to great physical pleasures surrounded him. Each of us lives less than a hundred years. In this world full of pleasures we all have to see clearly what it is that is most important for us to be doing during this lifetime. There has only ever been one life energy in these six hundred million years. This very same life energy that began back then is the one that is living in each and every one of us. To know this one and the same life energy and to share this huge state of mind with all that we encounter—this is the way of the bodhisattva. </p><p class="P3">Here in this section of the sutra, Buddha is speaking to Jisai bodhisattva. </p><p class="P6">14. The Buddha told Jisai (“Maintains the World” bodhisattva), “You go inquire about Vimalakīrti’s illness.” Jisai addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why?</p><p class="P6">“I remember once in the past when I was residing in a meditation chamber, Māra the Evil One, attended by twelve thousand goddesses and in a manner like Indra with his drum, music, and song, proceeded to where I was. He and his subordinates bowed their heads to my feet, held their palms together reverentially, and stood to one side.</p><p class="P6">“Thinking it was Indra, I said to him, ‘Welcome, Kauśika! Although [you enjoy] blessings you should not be self-indulgent. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and seek for the foundation of goodness, cultivating the perduring dharmas with regard to your body, life, and wealth.’</p><p class="P6">“He then said to me, ‘O good sir, [please] receive these twelve thousand goddesses to clean and wash [for you].’</p><p class="P6">“I said, ‘Kauśika, as a śramaṇa and son of Śākya I have no need for improper things such as this. This would not be appropriate for me.’</p><p class="P3">Jisai bodhisattva was asked to go to Vimalakirti, but he answered in this way. The king of the gods who is mentioned here, <span class="indexTerm">Indra</span> (Taishaku in Japanese), is not like an absolute God. He is the ruler, or organizer, of the heavenly realm.</p><p class="P3">We have six realms of existence: the hell realm, the brute realm, the hungry ghost realm, the human realm, the deva realm, then finally the realm of heavenly beings, which is the realm that people are born into after they have behaved well in other realms, but never knowing when they might misstep and fall again out of the heavenly realm and into one of the other realms. Movement among the realms is quite fluid. We learn by being in these other realms how to know true shame; we realize our weaknesses and our strengths, and then we can again be born into a realm that is higher. We continue our learning in these various realms. If we misstep or are careless, we can immediately fall from the heavenly realm. </p><p class="P3">One day, Mara, the great devil disguised as the god of the heavenly realm, brought 12,000 heavenly maidens to Jisai bodhisattva. Appearing in this form of the god of heaven, Mara gave a very fancy sounding sermon and then offered Jisai the 12,000 maidens to serve him. To this Jisai bodhisattva responded, “What are you talking about? This is a place of quiet meditation. This is a dojo.” </p><p class="P3">One time Priest <span class="indexTerm">Ganno</span> had some business in Kyoto. At Lake Biwa, near the town of Otsu, the rain caused the river crossing to flood, and Ganno could not pass and had to find a place to spend the night. Due to the hard rain he could not stay in the fields, and every place was full and crowded with people. Finally, he came to a house which was actually a brothel. The priest had never been in a place like this. There were no customers there, but the people who ran the place welcomed the priest, saying, “Please come in, come in!” All the women called to him. Because of the rain the women were lacking customers, and when the priest came they all thought what a good customer he would be. Since the priest had no place to stay, he had been feeling sorry for himself; now here he was being welcomed by so many to come in. He thought, “What a kindness, what a great kindness!” He had not been received anywhere else, and now he had a place to stay. They took him into the living room and fed him tea, candy, a big feast, even sake. He was confused and said “I do not need such service. Thank you, but I only need a place to stay.” He tried to refuse, but the head of the place came and said “If you stay here, we have all of these girls, and you must purchase one.” Priest Ganno said, “What do you mean; purchase a girl?” The owner said, “You give us money, and the girl will do whatever you want her to.” “Oh, this place is a place like that. I didn’t know that. Ok, how many women do you have here?” “We have five women.” “In that case, I will buy all five of them.” Of course the owner was very pleased that in such bad times one customer was going to buy all of his women. He called all the women in to where the priest was sitting. Priest Ganno said, “Is this all of them?” He lined them all up, hung his Jizo Bosatsu scroll in the tokonoma, lit some incense and said, “Everyone please stand in the direction of the Jizo bodhisattva and put your hands together.” The priest taught the girls to chant a sutra and how to prostrate to the bodhisattva. The young maidens were amazed. They were used to playing the shamisen and singing to men, and here they were bowing to the Buddha. They thought he was a little bit nuts. There were some who began to laugh, but the priest did not pay any attention and kept saying, “Honor to the great bodhisattva.” He encouraged them all. “Everyone continue! Together, prostrate!” They were all drawn along by his deep compassion and determination. They prostrated and prostrated, their foreheads touching the tatami, chanting the sutra wholeheartedly. All of the stuck, entangled places in their minds started to come undone, and they began sweating all over their bodies. Hour after hour after hour they chanted and did prostrations to the Buddha. They followed the priest wholeheartedly on into the middle of the night when he said, “All right, that’s enough. Everybody go to bed.”</p><p class="P3">The next day when the rain stopped, the priest could cross the bridge, and so he left. All the women followed him out and sent him off, so sad to see him go. They said, “We are working in this world. We are all born happy yet we didn’t know there was such a wonderful thing as being able to pray and bow to Buddha.” They continued bowing to him and thanking him for teaching them to prostrate and to believe in the Buddha. “We have all been reborn. We’ve never had such a thing to be so deeply thankful for. It was a great good feeling to prostrate, and we are so thankful. We are so sad to see you go.” They all walked him to the ferry landing, lined up behind him and waved him off until they could see him no longer.</p><p class="P6">15. “Before I had even finished saying this Vimalakīrti came and said to me, ‘This is not Indra. This is Māra, who has come only to ridicule you.’ “He then said to Māra, ‘You can give these women to me. If it were I, I would accept them.’ “Māra then thought in shock, ‘Vimalakīrti should not be troubling me!’</p><p class="P6">He wanted to become invisible and leave but he could not disappear. Even using all his numinous power he was not able to leave.</p><p class="P6">“He then heard a voice from space, saying, ‘Evil One, if you give him the women you will be able to go.’</p><p class="P6">“Because of his fear, and with eyes casting nervously about, [Māra] gave Vimalakīrti the women.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti now teaches that you have all been living just as you feel like, everyday, all day. You are young now, but you won’t be young forever. You’ll have to turn those bodies in. Now is the time to awaken to your bodhisattva nature. Pleasure is always followed by dissatisfaction, and that is why we again and again feel compelled to seek further pleasure. There are greater pleasures, though, that are satisfying: to give true joy to other people, to live in harmony, to know the truth, to bring this treasure of the truest joy into your own and others’ lives, to realize your nature as a bodhisattva. This is not the limited joy of your own physical pleasure, which always gives rise to melancholy. Instead, right now, awaken to your true nature by being a bodhisattva. Vimalakirti spoke in this way to all the 12,000 young women.</p><p class="P6">16. “Then Vimalakīrti said to the women, ‘Māra has given you to me. You should now all generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.’</p><p class="P6">“He then explained the Dharma to them in various ways and caused them to generate the intention for enlightenment.</p><p class="P6">“He then said, ‘Now that you have generated the intention for enlightenment, you may amuse yourselves in the joy of the Dharma, never again taking pleasure in the five desires.’</p><p class="P6">“The goddesses asked, ‘What is the joy of the Dharma?’</p><p class="P3">Now, Vimalakirti teaches about dharma joy. Physical pleasures come from something external, such as a musical instrument. This is true of all physical pleasures, but dharma joy comes forth from within. Dancing simply from our utmost inner joy, we can’t help but dance. This is not the same as dancing to an external musical instrument. The same is true with singing, which wells up from deep inside of us out of our great joy. A zen phrase expresses this joy within nature this way, “<span class="T3">The flowers of nature are all laughter and mirth, the birds are singing with great joy</span>.” [ZS] This is actually about our mind feeling those feelings when we perceive the flowers, the moon, and the sun shining. This is  truly a dharma joy. </p><p class="P3">Usual pleasures of the world are those which use external things to bring them about, while dharma joy comes forth from deep within.</p><p class="P6">“He answered, ‘Joy is to always trust the Buddha. Joy is to desire to hear the Dharma. Joy is to make offerings to the assembly. Joy is to transcend the five desires. Joy is to contemplate the five skandhas as vengeful bandits. Joy is to contemplate the four elements as poisonous snakes. Joy is to contemplate the interior sensory capacities as being like empty aggregations. Joy is to maintain one’s intention for enlightenment in all situations. Joy is to benefit sentient beings. Joy is to revere teachers. Joy is the extensive practice of charity. Joy is the firm maintenance of the precepts. Joy is forbearance and pliability. Joy is the vigorous accumulation of good roots. Joy is the lack of disturbance in meditation. Joy is to transcend the defilements in wisdom. Joy is to disseminate bodhicitta.”</p><p class="P3">These are not external joys but joys from within. As <span class="indexTerm">Rinzai Zenji</span> has said, “That of the dharma body, the clean pure light in the moment of your mind; that of the sambogakaya body, the undifferentiated light in a moment of your mind; that of the nirmanakaya body, the undiscriminating light in a moment of your mind.”  </p><p class="P3">We have this deeper understanding, but because we are always looking externally, we don’t realize these states of mind, full of light, this deeper pleasure. As Rinzai has also put it, from the origin, it is one great undifferentiated light, which then divides into the six rays of the senses. Or as Dogen has said, if we are simple and natural in mind, we perceive with our senses, and this joy is a matter of course. We have the sun which is rising and the moon which is setting. We have the cocks that are crowing at dawn. And we have, once after every three years, a leap year. The joy of these proceeding in their natural order, this is the dharma joy. The inner joy of the sangha is knowing that deep True mind is present in all people. There is no one who is not endowed from the origin with this clear mind. There is no difference in the depth of mind of any person, and we live in the joy of knowing that truth. </p><p class="P6"> “Joy is the subjugation of the host of Māras. Joy is the eradication of the afflictions. Joy is purification of the countries of the buddhas. Joy is the accomplishment of the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks, based on the cultivation of the merits. Joy is ornamentation of the place of enlightenment. Joy is to hear the profound Dharma without fear. Joy is the three emancipations and not to take the pleasure [of ultimate enlightenment] at an inappropriate time. Joy is to associate with fellow trainees. Joy is for one’s mind to be without hindrance in the midst of those [who are] not one’s fellow trainees. Joy is to defend against evil friends. Joy is to associate closely with good friends. Joy is to be happy and pure in mind. Joy is to cultivate the immeasurable factors of enlightenment.</p><p class="P3">“‘These are the bodhisattva’s joy in the Dharma.’</p><p class="P3">Just as we read earlier, we have the <span class="indexTerm">six paramitas</span>, which are the practices for the realization of our bodhisattva nature: charity, virtue, patience, good efforts, samadhi and wisdom. These six come up again and again. When we enjoy offering our services to all others, our joy in realizing these deep ways of offering that service is endless. This is the way of building Buddha lands from a healthy state of mind. </p><p class="P3">In this way, our body becomes free of anger and ignorance, and we are able to know a life that has deep meaning. We become free of despair and disappointment, which always is present when we only seek physical pleasure. And this is the true way of deepening that inner joy. </p><p class="P3">Our true joy is to realize the dharma in all of these many ways. In teaching these 12,000 young women, Vimalakirti was able to teach all the young people. </p><p class="P6">17. “At this Māra the Evil One announced to the women, ‘I want to return with you to the heavenly palace.’</p><p class="P6">“The women said, ‘You already gave us to this retired scholar. We are extremely joyful in the joy of the Dharma, and will never again take pleasure in the five desires.’</p><p class="P6">“Māra said, ‘If the retired scholar is able to forsake these women, and everything that exists is given to him, then he is a bodhisattva.’</p><p class="P6">“Vimalakīrti said, ‘I have already forsaken them. You may take them away, but you must make all sentient beings attain fulfillment of their vows in the Dharma.’</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti had given them the teaching of truth, and then Mara reappeared, saying: “How long are you going to hang out with this Vimalakirti, listening to him talking in his sleep? Let us go home.” To this they said to him, “What are you talking about? Vimalakirti has now taught us the truth. Why should we have to return to your world of physical pleasure?” This was a big problem for Mara, so he started to accuse Vimalakirti of being possessive. Vimalakirti said, he just taught them the truth. They could go or they could stay, whichever they chose to do.</p><p class="P6">“At this the women asked Vimalakīrti, ‘How should we reside in Māra’s palace?’</p><p class="P6">18. “Vimalakīrti said, ‘Sisters, there is a Dharma called “inexhaustible lamp.” You should study it. The inexhaustible lamp is like a lamp that ignites a hundred thousand lamps, illuminating all darkness with an illumination that is never exhausted. Thus, sisters, if a single bodhisattva guides a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi, that bodhisattva’s intention to achieve enlightenment will also never be extinguished.</p><p class="P6">“‘With each teaching of the Dharma all the good dharmas are naturally increased. This is what is called the “inexhaustible lamp.” Although you reside in Māra’s palace, with this inexhaustible lamp you can cause innumerable gods and goddesses to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. Thereby you will repay the Buddha’s kindness and also greatly benefit all sentient beings.’</p><p class="P3">Then the goddesses said, it seems we have to go home. But we have now realized this truth, so tell us how we can live in the world of so many external pleasures and keep this greater truth alive which we have just learned? How can we keep it in mind? If we return to a world of desire and pleasure, we might forget what we have learned. To this, Vimalakirti gave them the teaching of the inexhaustible lamp, about how the flame of one lamp touches and lights hundreds and then thousands of other lamps, so our awakening of the truth brings the same awakening to many others’ minds as well. Because others don’t yet know the truth, we must share this light so that a hundred to a thousand to ten-thousand will also be able to realize this truth. From there the bodhisattva’s light of truth will shine brightly, and for this we have to continually make all possible efforts. We have to bring this truth to all people, and then you will not fall again into superficial reliance on external pleasures. He tells them to hold this teaching precious and share what they have learned with all others.</p><p class="P6">19. “At that time the goddesses bowed their heads to Vimalakīrti’s feet in worship and suddenly disappeared to return to Māra’s palace.</p><p class="P6">“World-honored One, Vimalakīrti’s autonomy, numinous power, wisdom, and eloquence are like this. Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P3">One of the Roshi’s disciples was riding on the all-night ferry that goes from Shimonoseki Harbor in Japan to Korea. This is a ferry that you get on in the evening and it arrives on the Korean shore early the next morning just as the light is coming up. His disciple was on this ferry and, having a whole night and nothing that needed doing, he went up to the top deck and was sitting zazen. He sat there through the night, and the next morning when the dawn was breaking and the ferry was coming into Korea, just as they were all moving to get off the ferry, an unfamiliar woman came up and suddenly thanked him profusely. She told him how she had that very night decided to commit suicide and had gone up onto the same deck, where she had planned to jump off the edge of the deck in the dark and kill herself. But she had felt something there in the dark, in the hard-to-see murkiness; she looked around and there he had been sitting, completely still, doing zazen in the night. She could only wonder what he was doing. And in her contemplation of what he was sitting there doing, she suddenly understood how deeply foolish she was to kill herself, to die and to lose this one precious life. She had come to this conclusion and saved her life, and she was thanking him for being there. She no longer had any interest in committing suicide, and she had come to tell him thank you. </p><p class="P3">The disciple told the Roshi this story, and at that moment the Roshi felt how true a teaching this had been: that a true dharma teaching did not always involve a lot of spoken words, did not need a lot of talking. And we are all here now, also sitting zazen every single day; this is also a true teaching for all those around us who don’t always understand what we are doing here sitting in osesshin. People who are around us wonder, what is moving that person to do that? Why is he sitting there? In a world where there is frequently nothing left to believe in or trust in, people wonder about this. To sit and simply clarify our deepest mind. Others see this, and although they may not understand it all at once, little by little it becomes clearer. </p><p class="P3">If they get even a whiff of this, those who are absorbed in physical pleasure can begin to see things differently. This teaching is taught in detail in <span class="indexTerm"><span class="T3">The Inexhaustible Lamp</span></span>. This teaching is of immeasurable importance, its value is unfathomable. We cannot imagine the power of our inner joy to touch others in this way. This is not done with physical pleasure. We all need to look at this deeply and clearly once again. </p><p class="P2">Zentoku</p><p class="P3">The next bodhisattva written about is Zentoku bodhisattva, the merchant’s son. </p><p class="P6">20. The Buddha told the elder’s son “Good Virtue”,“You go inquire about Vimalakrti’s illness.”</p><p class="P6">Good Virtue addressed the Buddha, “World-honored One, I dare not accept your instruction to go inquire about his illness. Why?</p><p class="P6">“I remember once in the past when I was holding a great charity assembly in my father’s house. We made offerings to all the śramaṇas, brahmans, those of the heterodox paths, the poor, low-class, orphans, and beggars. It lasted fully seven days. At the time Vimalakīrti came into the assembly and said to me, ‘Elder’s son, you should not hold a great charity assembly like this. You should have an assembly of the charity of the Dharma. What use is a charity assembly of material wealth?’</p><p class="P3">At the very beginning of the sutra, Koshaku bodhisattva, along with 499 other young bodhisattvas, had brought a huge sun parasol to where Vimalakirti was. India is such a hot country, the wealthy walk under umbrellas, which are held up by their servants. Five hundred young, wealthy men, among them Koshaku, had come to hear the teachings from the beginning of this text with Vimalakirti. In their deep gratitude for Buddha’s teaching, they had brought huge, bejeweled parasols, 500 of them, covered with precious gems. Those 500 great, bejeweled parasols were then rolled into one great parasol, and the story rolls into its opening. </p><p class="P3">Now, after being refused by all of his main disciples and the top bodhisattvas, Buddha asked Zentoku (“Good Virtue” or Sudatta), although he was a layperson, to go to visit Vimalakirti because of his sickness. At this time Zentoku was one of the foremost rich sons in Vaisali. He was traveling throughout India helping the poor. Among the people, he was a bodhisattva. But Zentoku bodhisattva was no different from the others; he said his wisdom just was not sufficient, was not huge enough to go to see Vimalakirti. Then he explained: this a practice in India, and in other countries, in order to be generous they ‘sacrifice’ many possessions and make a huge offering to all the people. The father of Zentoku bodhisattva had, over a period of seven days, made great offerings to people of all different ranks—religious devotees, Brahmins, the poor, the wretched, the unfortunate beggars, and all of the needy. They gave them endless things and food, and even prepared baths for them over these several days. Then Vimalakirti enters and says, “This material offering, this is not true offering. You should be offering true dharma. He taught the greater merit in offering those things which are not material, and in this way he encouraged them to share dharma offerings. </p><p class="P6">“I said, ‘Retired scholar, what is an assembly of the charity of Dharma?’ “He answered, </p><p class="P6">21. “‘An assembly of the charity of the Dharma is to make offerings to all sentient beings simultaneously, without before and after. This is called an assembly of the charity of the Dharma.</p><p class="P3">Here Zentoku bodhisattva asks Vimalakirti, “What is dharma sacrifice?” The rich merchant, <span class="indexTerm">Shudatsu</span> Shojet, was constantly making offerings to the poor people of India. He was the greatest, richest person in India. Supplies of material things, however, all eventually run out. Shudatsu and his wife had opened hundreds of storehouses and given completely, to everyone, until they had no food left to eat. They had one unopened storehouse. Inside it they found one huge rice-measuring wooden box, and by selling this they had money for a little food. Around this time, the Buddha, Mokuren Sonja, Sharihoja Sonja, and all the other disciples came by for alms gathering. </p><p class="P3">Her husband was not at home when they came, but Shudatsu’s wife gave away all of the food, their last food, to the Buddha and his disciples. They ate everything. Her husband came home, and she was in tears because she had given everything away, and now they had nothing to eat. And he said. “Well done! Well done! To give away things when it is easy and when you have a lot, anyone can do that. But to give away everything when you have nothing after that, that is truly difficult, a true dharma sacrifice.” When they went back to look again into the storehouse to see if anything was left, they were astonished. They found that all of the storehouses were now refilled with everything they had given to everyone. This is because a dharma sacrifice is always repaid. Material things are gone when they are given, and the person receiving the gift may in turn give a ‘best thing’. The dharma sacrifice is always refilling itself, giving back continuously.</p><p class="P6">“‘If you ask how I say this, I say that one uses bodhi to generate sympathy. One generates great compassion in order to save sentient beings. One generates joy by maintaining the correct Dharma. One practices equanimity by mastering wisdom.</p><p class="P3">Next, the infinite, immeasurable mind’s charity is taught. This is the deep giving of complete compassion, which is a combination of both taking away pain and giving comfort. Giving rise to our deepest bodhisattva vow, to liberate all beings from suffering, we give to all the people nearby and give to all dharma friends everything that we have learned. Giving to all people the teachings of truth, taking away their selfishness, is the way of the dharma sacrifice. </p><p class="P3">Next, in dharma sacrifice, we offer the six paramitas of charity, of observing the precepts, of patience, of great efforts, of deepest meditation, and of wisdom. </p><p class="P6">22. “‘One generates dāna-pāramitā (the perfection of charity) by mastering desire. One generates śīla-pāramitā (the perfection of morality) by attracting those who transgress the precepts. One generates kṣanti-pāramitā (the perfection of forbearance) by the Dharma of no-self. One generates vīrya-pāramitā (the perfection of exertion) by transcending the characteristics of body and mind. One generates dhyāna-pāramitā (the perfection of meditation) with the characteristic of bodhi. One generates prajñā-pāramitā (the perfection of wisdom) with omniscience.</p><p class="P3">We have these six paramitas to relieve the burdens of our ego and our small-self. In order to go beyond that small-minded self-concern we have to learn to practice charity. Continually, we encourage each other; making efforts in practice, letting go of rigid conditions we would put on all things, being free from dualism and mental rigidity, so that we can realize infinite wisdom. This is the dharma sacrifice. </p><p class="P6">23. “‘One teaches sentient beings and generates emptiness. Without forsaking the conditioned dharmas, one generates that which is without characteristics. One manifests the experience of [re]birth and generates the uncreated.</p><p class="P6">24. “‘One defends the correct Dharma and generates the power of skillful means. One generates the four means of attraction by saving sentient beings. One generates the elimination of conceit by reverencing all. One generates the three perduring dharmas with regard to body, life, and wealth. One generates contemplation of the dharmas within the six mindfulnesses. One generates sincerity with regard to the six types of considerate esteem. One generates pure livelihood with correct practice of the good dharmas. One becomes close to the wise and sagely with purification of the mind in joy. One generates a disciplined mind by not having aversion for bad people. One generates the profound mind with the dharma of leaving home. One generates erudition by practicing according to the explanation. One generates the locus of empty repose with the dharma of non-contention. In approaching buddha wisdom one generates sitting in repose. In releasing the bonds of sentient beings one generates the stages of cultivation.</p><p class="P3">Vimalakirti was cautioning Zentoku. In the <span class="indexTerm">Diamond Sutra</span> the Buddha says to Subhuti that when bodhisattvas are giving they must not be attached to the form of what they give. That which is giving must be empty. That which is given must be empty. That which is receiving must be empty. If there is any attachment to that which is given or who is giving and receiving, that is not a true offering. A true offering is given to liberate all human beings. The bodhisattva must not have any calculated thoughts at all that someone might be happy or feel lucky because they are being given something. If the bodhisattva’s mind is one with the true Dharma, naturally one offers only Dharma. But if there is something in our mind caught on a thing, caught on giving something to someone, caught on the person we are giving to, caught on us giving something, or caught on that thing that we give, then we are like one in the dark who cannot see anything around ourselves, completely stuck in darkness. We are only giving something that we feel we possess. We have to cut that attachment to whatever we offer and be clear that we have no connection to it. Even our own physical bodies are given for only a short time. So in giving to others we become a huge bright clear mind, and that is the true offering. To offer and give to the world and become bright and clear in mind is our true offering, not to get small and petty about what we give or who we are giving to or that we are “givers.”</p><p class="P6">25. “‘By becoming replete in the [thirty-two primary] characteristics and [eighty subsidiary] marks and by purifying a buddha land one generates meritorious karma. Understanding the thoughts of all sentient beings and how one should explain the Dharma to them, one generates the karma of wisdom. Understanding all the dharmas, one neither grasps nor forsakes. Entering the gate of the single characteristic, one generates the karma of sagacity. Eradicating all the afflictions, all the hindrances, and all the nongood dharmas, one generates all good karma.</p><p class="P3">Next we have the three gates of emptiness: First, to not be fooled by appearances of phenomena, which might make us feel pity or become violent due to the appearances to which we have become attached. To see that all is phenomena. To see through the phenomena and not be moved around by them. This is very challenging, but this is also a dharma sacrifice. Second, we are always making efforts and then thinking, ‘what great efforts we have just made’, becoming upset because others don’t respond and change in accordance with the efforts we think we are making. To not be attached to our efforts or the results of our efforts. The third gate is to work hard from morning until night, never even thinking about how much and how hard we are working. To be pure and clear in our mind so that we are never clinging to what we are doing; the same as a mirror, which only reflects exactly what is in front of it without adding anything to that. These are the gates of emptiness. They come more and more easily with our zazen’s ripening. For us to move and go chasing after things, that is delusion. Instead, to be more and more centered and realized within; then all things come to us, and that is satori. Things are then arriving where we are. When the receiving, the giving, and the contents of what is received and given are empty, then there is true dharma sacrifice. Simultaneously, to offer kind words and kind acts with true generosity, and to bring that kind of relating to and activity with all people, is also a dharma sacrifice. </p><p class="P6">26. “‘By attaining omniscience and all the good dharmas, one universally generates the dharmas that assist one’s buddhahood. Thus, good man, is the assembly of the charity of the Dharma. If a bodhisattva resides in this assembly of the charity of the Dharma he will be a great donor. He will also be a field of blessings for the entire world.’</p><p class="P6">“World-honored One, when Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, two hundred people in the congregation of brahmans all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P6">27. “At the time my own mind attained a purity which I exclaimed to be unprecedented, and I bowed my head to Vimalakīrti’s feet in worship. Unfastening my necklace, a hundred thousand [coins] in value, I gave it to him but he did not accept it. I said, ‘Please, retired scholar, you must accept this and give it to whomever you please.’ Vimalakīrti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. Taking one part, he gave it to the lowliest beggars in the assembly. Taking the other part, he offered it to the Tathāgata Difficult to Overcome. The entire assembly saw the Radiant Illumination country and Difficult to Overcome Tathāgata. They also saw the necklace on that Buddha change into a four-pillared jewel-laden platform, with mutually non-interfering ornamentation on the four sides.</p><p class="P3">We train deeply on our inner path to know the Dharma as an essential thing; we train deeply on our inner path to act in alignment with that wisdom, and to offer this to others. To see others’ states of mind deeply and offer them Dharma and wisdom accordingly. All the ten thousand things are not created nor dismantled, and we must know our deep wisdom relating to them. We cut away things that are not positive and gather things that are positive. When we do this we are able to gather all merit and wisdom, and this is the way of becoming Buddha for all beings. Offering is about a wide mind of wisdom. Then the material things are alive. In this way, Vimalakirti patiently taught everyone about raising the mind of the bodhisattva. That was this pearl necklace beyond value that everyone bowed to. This necklace, which Zentoku gave to Vimalakirti, was divided in two; it was shared with the poorest of the poor, and it created the pavilion of light, which shone on everyone.</p><p class="P6">28. “Having manifested these numinous transformations, Vimalakīrti then said, ‘If a donor with an attitude of universal sameness gives to the lowliest beggars, this is to be like the characteristic of the Tathāgata’s field of blessings, with no distinction, and to be equivalent to great compassion without seeking any reward. This is called “to be replete in the charity of the Dharma.”’</p><p class="P6">29. “The lowliest beggars in the city witnessed this numinous power and heard his explanation, and they all generated the intention to achieve anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p class="P3"> There is no value in giving only to high-powered people. The True mind of the bodhisattva vow gives to everyone equally. All people are equal. The poorest people of the city gathered and saw the miracle of the pavilion of light, and all were enlightened. Some were so sick they wanted to die that day, but when they saw this sight they were purified. The purity of the three is the giving, the giver, and the given. In this brightness we let go of all our opinions. We know the place where our clean human nature surges through, and we can see how much we have been living in our own small ideas of how we are. There is no giver, no giving, and no given.</p><p class="P6">“Therefore, I cannot accept [your instruction] to go inquire about his illness.”</p><p class="P6">30. In similar fashion all of the bodhisattvas explained their original encounters and related what Vimalakīrti had said, and each said he was unable to accept [the Buddha’s instruction] to go inquire about his illness.</p><p class="P3">The name of this dojo is Tahoma-san Sogen-ji; it was before, the One Drop Zendo Monastery.  120 years ago at Sogen-ji in Japan, there lived a monk named <span class="indexTerm">Yuri Tekisui</span>.  He came from the deep countryside near Kyoto, in that era, far from Okayama. He wanted nothing but to throw himself completely into his training until it was totally completed, and therefore he went to train with the very severe teacher named <span class="indexTerm">Gisan Zenrai Zenji</span>, who was famous at that time.  One day the new monk was on the job of making the bath for the roshi with water from the well, which is still in use at Sogen-ji. When the roshi got into the bath, he said, “The water is too hot.  Bring more water.”  The monk quickly dumped the few drops of water from the bucket near the bath, and he went out to get more water from the well to cool down the bath, until finally the roshi said it was ok. The monk thought his work was over and went to leave, but the roshi said, “What was that you did?!”  The monk said, “Well, I just put the water in the bath…”  The roshi said, “Before that. When you came in here there was a bucket, and you carelessly tossed out the remaining drops of water that were in that bucket before you went out to get more water for the bath.  How could you do that?  Those precious drops of water, how could you so carelessly toss them aside?  If you had poured them on some vegetables or a tree or a flower they would have given life.  There’s a whole universe of life in those drops that you so carelessly just tossed aside, not even being aware of it or noticing them.  If you have no more consciousness than that, you are doomed, and no matter how much you train it will never come to anything.  If you are unable to see the huge universe and energy in those drops of water, how can you think that your training is bringing you anything as you sit zazen?”</p><p class="P3">These words were spoken sharply and deeply to the monk; they rested in his mind so profoundly that he changed his name to “One Drop of Water-Zenji.” This monk, One Drop of Water-Zenji, later became a great teacher—not only a teacher in Kyoto, but also a person who took a temple that had nearly been destroyed and, because of his great efforts and his wisdom, was able to bring this temple back to life. And this temple is still functioning today. </p><p class="P3">As <span class="indexTerm">Tekisui Zenji</span>, the One Drop of Water-zenji, was dying, he gave this poem: </p><p class="P5">This one drop of water from Sogen, for 74 years I have used its teaching. </p><p class="P5">I have never been able to exhaust it.</p><p class="P5">It now extends throughout the heavens and earth.  </p><p class="P5">It extends in all the ten directions.</p><p class="P3">Being taught not to waste even one drop of water—for 74 years he used and used and used this teaching and could never use it up. A true teaching gives light to all of life and can never be exhausted.  It shines and expands throughout the heavens and earth.  Material things, once given, are gone.  But a teaching of truth will continue through generations endlessly.  This is the teaching that Vimalakirti is giving us, telling us the difference between material sacrifice and Dharma sacrifice.</p><p class="Standard"/></body></html>
